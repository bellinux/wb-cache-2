50|$|This case {{demonstrates}} a court determining whether an accrual method taxpayer may deduct liabilities {{that may or}} may not be paid in the taxable year. The court applied the test found <b>in</b> <b>Treas.</b> Reg. § 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) to determine that the casino's liabilities were in fact fixed on the date when the minimum number of club points were acquired. The fact that certain club members may choose not to redeem their points does not mean that they did not have an enforceable right against the casino. The court also pointed out that this decision would not lead to the casino escaping tax liability, as the casino would recapture as income the liabilities that were not actually discharged. The decision helps accrual method taxpayers understand when a contingent future liabilities become deductible expenses, allowing them to both file more accurate returns and better anticipate the tax consequences of their actions.|$|R

Third, other courts and commentators have taken the position that windfalls, including found monies, were properly includable in gross income under Section 22(a) of the 1939 Code, which is the predecessor of Section 61(a) in the 1954/1986 Code. Plaintiffs were unable to point to any inconsistencies between the gross income sections of the Code, the interpretation of them by the regulations and the courts, and the revenue rulings.

This study was an exploratory qualitative research. The procedure used of selecting subject is snowball sampling, so that 12 subjects were obtained whose data could be analyzed. The data collection was conducted using think aloud method. The data validation was carried out using time triangulation. Techniques of analyzing data used were: (1) classifying data into 4 categories: (a) understanding problem, (b) thinking about plan, (c) implementing the plan, (d) rechecking the answer, (2) presenting the data in narrative text and (3) drawing a conclusion about difficulty, cause, and solution to metacognitive <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> each category.
