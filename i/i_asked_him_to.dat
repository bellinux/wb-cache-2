500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|MSR Studios was {{the final}} New York City-based studio used, and where most of 4 was {{recorded}}—only [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "I Was Here" [...] were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as [...] "I Care" [...] and [...] "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write and record [...] "I Miss You" [...] at MSR, saying to Complex, [...] " [...] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly to New York and work on my record." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Beyoncé sat for an {{interview}} with Gabriel Alvarez of Complex magazine, where she elaborated on how she came to know about Ocean: [...] "Jay had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn.

[...] In this way, Ocean ended up co-writing [...] "I Miss You". Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyoncé's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote.

500|$|Before {{the release}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a {{relatively}} unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, {{it was noted that}} Ocean had become the [...] "go-to vocal hook man." [...] The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". Singer Beyoncé Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write [...] "I Miss You" [...] for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; [...] "Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn.

500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis.
