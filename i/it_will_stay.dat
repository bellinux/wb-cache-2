Until the Dutch government decides {{what to do with}} the waste, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> at COVRA, which currently has a license to operate for one hundred years. As of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent disposal facility.|$|E

The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E

25|$|N.W. 39th Expressway, still {{carrying}} SH-66, {{forms the}} main street of both Bethany and Warr Acres, two enclave suburbs of Oklahoma City. The street passes just to the south of Wiley Post Airport and provides access to Southern Nazarene University. After leaving Warr Acres, the highway re-enters Oklahoma City. SH-66 leaves N.W. 39th Expressway at an interchange with I-44 and SH-3/SH-74 (the Lake Hefner Parkway). SH-66 begins a concurrency with eastbound I-44, and for the remainder of its length, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> close to the interstate.|$|E
25|$|Exaerete dentata and Exaerete smaragdina, {{which both}} {{belong to the}} Euglossini tribe, are two kleptoparasitic bees that will lay their eggs in Ef. surinamensis nests. A female Ex. dentata will open a sealed cell carefully, {{removing}} bits of bark from the cell cap. Though some bark will fall away, most of <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> attached to the female for later use. Once she can reach inside, she will use her mandibles to crush the Ef. surinamensis egg {{and replace it with}} her own egg. Then she will reseal the cell using the original bark.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Oracle changed Berkeley DB's license {{from the}} Sleepycat license to the Affero General Public License, thus restricting {{its use in}} a wide variety of applications. This caused the Debian project to exclude the library from 6.0 onwards. It was also criticized that this license is not {{friendly}} to commercial redistributors. The discussion was sparked over whether the same licensing change could happen to LMDB. Author Howard Chu made clear that LMDB is part of the OpenLDAP project, which had its BSD style license before he joined, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> like it. No copyright is transferred to anybody by checking in, which would make a similar move like Oracle's impossible.|$|E

More recent military history is apparent shortly thereafter when 9 passes now-closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base, a pillar of the regional economy Plattsburgh has struggled to replace.|$|E
25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the phrase}} [...] "Crime of 1873" [...] in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator Henry M.

500|$|As the oil {{advanced}} {{through the}} pipeline, it was paced {{by a series}} of inspectors who traveled along the pipeline route to ensure the weight of the oil did not cause the pipeline to settle or create problems on bridges as the unbalanced weight of the oil front passed over them. This first inspection crew was followed by a second, and others patrolled the pipeline regularly as the oil front passed down the line. The first oil arrived in Valdez on July 28, 1977, at 11:02 p.m. The oil was only , but it gradually warmed as the system reached a thermal equilibrium. After the initial startup, the pipeline was intended to run continuously. Said an engineer: [...] "We start up this pipeline once ... <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> onstream then forever ...

500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{opening of}} the border had a {{profound}} political and psychological effect on the East German public.

[...] Those crossing the border, however, found that West Germany had achieved vastly superior prosperity without socialism, brotherhood with the Soviet Union, revolutionary values {{and the rest of the}} self-justifying mythology that underlay the SED's claims to moral superiority. The power of the SED's mythology evaporated overnight and previously prized ideological attributes became liabilities, rather than stepping stones for advancement.|$|E

The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, [...] "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings. It's harder for adults to fully understand, since so much has already been built up around us, but kids {{have the chance to}} grow up thinking in a healthier way.

2500|$|Other than recent drinking, {{the most}} common source of mouth alcohol is from belching or burping. This causes the liquids and/or gases from the stomach—including any alcohol—to rise up into the soft tissue of the {{esophagus}} and oral cavity, where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> until it has dissipated. The American Medical Association concludes in its Manual for Chemical Tests for Intoxication (1959): [...] "True reactions with alcohol in expired breath from sources other than the alveolar air (eructation, regurgitation, vomiting) will, of course, vitiate the breath alcohol results." [...] For this reason, police officers are supposed to keep a DUI suspect under observation for at least 15 minutes prior to administering a breath test. Instruments such as the Intoxilyzer 5000 also feature a [...] "slope" [...] parameter. This parameter detects any decrease in alcohol concentration of 0.006g per 210L of breath in 0.6second, a condition indicative of residual mouth alcohol, and will result in an [...] "invalid sample" [...] warning to the operator, notifying the operator {{of the presence of}} the residual mouth alcohol. PBT's, however, feature no such safeguard.|$|E

Two months later, The Verge reported, [...] "in the midst of rampant piracy on top of Measure B, many studios have relocated to Las Vegas, where filmmaking is cheaper and regulations are more lax."
