5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> is mixed with water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} that water {{fluoridation}} reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
5|$|Rose or mint {{water is}} a drink {{commonly}} added to Palestinian sweets and dishes. However, {{it is also a}} popular drink on its own, and is seen as refreshing in the heated summers. Herbs such as sage can also be boiled with water to create a <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> is sometimes used for medicinal purposes. A warm drink made from sweetened milk with salep garnished with walnuts, coconut flakes and cinnamon, is known as sahlab and is primarily served during the winter season.|$|E
5000|$|Non-alcoholic drinks often signify <b>drinks</b> <b>that</b> would {{normally}} contain alcohol, such as beer and wine, but {{are made with}} less than [...]5 percent alcohol by volume.

5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and <b>drink)</b> <b>that</b> could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|At the party, Veronica {{notices that}} the “rape coasters” which test for date rape drugs do not {{actually}} work. Veronica, Mac, and Piz test various peoples’ cups and find nothing. After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, and they have a quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

25|$|The French {{food safety}} agency was {{concerned}} about taurine. A Red Bull <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> did not contain taurine was introduced. The French refusal of market approval was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008, because it was unable to prove a definite health risk, taurine-related or not.|$|E

25|$|Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E
25|$|The Tyneside keelmen were {{employed}} by the Newcastle Hostmen and were often in dispute with their employers. They went on strike in 1709, 1710, 1740 and 1750. One grievance held by the keelmen was that the Hostmen, {{in order to avoid}} custom duties, would deliberately overload the keels. Duty was paid on each keel-load, so that it paid the owner to load as much coal as possible. This meant that the keel-load gradually increased from 16 tons in 1600 to 21.25 tons in 1695. As the keelmen were paid by the keel-load, they had to work considerably harder for the same pay. Even after the keel-load had been standardised, there were cases of keel owners illegally enlarging the holds to carry more coal, as much as 26.5 tons. In 1719 and 1744, the Tyneside keelmen went on strike in protest at this 'overmeasure'. The 1750 strike was also against 'overmeasure', as well as against 'can-money', the practice of paying part of the keelmen's wages in <b>drink</b> <b>that</b> had to be consumed at 'can-houses', pubs owned by the employers.|$|E
