Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus is large, dark and large-toothed, regillus {{is large and}} dark, and albiventer is large and relatively pale.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005.

At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring {{the view of the}} impact crater.|$|E

5|$|During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region {{near the}} south pole. Temperatures {{in this region}} ranged from 85–90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm to be {{explained}} by solar heating, indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} solar ultraviolet radiation or energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus. The latter process would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, because the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Titania's interior. The escape of CO2 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that {{there are at least three}} or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration and settlement of plantation workers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the country. This led to a demographic change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E

5|$|A {{railway system}} {{formerly}} known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Division to the port in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) during the British occupation. The railway line connects Tanjung Aru in Kota Kinabalu to Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today, the railway line is known as the Western Line and managed by the Sabah State Railway, providing daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the North Borneo Railway, which caters mainly for tourists. This antique steam train service only running on Saturday and Wednesday mornings from Tanjung Aru station to Kinarut station before returning back to the former station. In 2016, the Tanjung Aru railway station was moved to Aeropod with a new terminal and more public facilities.|$|E
5|$|As marine furs became {{depleted}} in {{the early}} 19th century, American ship captains began to accept increasing numbers of land furs such as beaver, which were brought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> to the coast via indigenous trade networks from New Caledonia—today the Omineca and Nechako districts of the Central Interior of British Columbia. During the 1820s, the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which considered the interior fur trade to be its domain, began to experience significant losses {{as a result of}} this diversion of furs to the coast. To protect its interests, the HBC entered the coast trade to drive away the American traders. This goal was achieved during the 1830s. By 1841, the American traders had abandoned the North West Coast. For a time, the North West Coast trade was controlled by the HBC and the RAC. Following the 1846 resolution of the Oregon Territory controversy between the United States and England, and the American purchase of Alaska in 1867, American hunters returned to hunting sea otters in the region, both from land and sea. Hunting throughout the Aleutian and Kuril Islands by American commercial outfits also contributed to the near-extinction of the species by the late 1800s.|$|E
