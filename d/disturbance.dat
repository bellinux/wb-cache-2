5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical <b>disturbance</b> {{that left the}} Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the <b>disturbance</b> was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the <b>disturbance</b> into an area of low wind shear, and the <b>disturbance</b> intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} <b>disturbance</b> {{was expected}} to bring heavy, yet needed rainfall to the Bahamas. The precursor <b>disturbance</b> dropped heavy precipitation while moving across Florida, including in Indian River County, and also produced 6–8ft (1.8–2.4m) waves with moderate wind gusts.|$|E
5|$|Three circulations {{developed}} {{within the}} monsoon trough that {{extended from the}} Philippines to the Marshall Islands, {{at the beginning of}} October 1979. The westernmost <b>disturbance</b> developed into Typhoon Sarah west of Luzon, on October 1. On October 3, a <b>disturbance</b> southwest of Guam developed into Tropical Storm Roger, and later on the same day, a third tropical <b>disturbance</b> that would later become Typhoon Tip formed south of Pohnpei. Strong flow from across the equator was drawn into Roger's wind circulation, initially preventing significant development of the precursor <b>disturbance</b> to Tip. Despite the unfavorable air pattern, the tropical <b>disturbance</b> gradually organized as it moved westward. Due to the large-scale circulation pattern of Tropical Storm Roger, Tip's precursor moved erratically and slowly executed a cyclonic loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a closed low-level circulation, and early on October 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression Twenty-Three.|$|E

40|$|Tropical <b>disturbances</b> {{over the}} South China Sea (SCS) {{during the period}} of 1997 - 2006 are {{analyzed}} using the Tropical Storm and Hurricane WX products. A total of 158 tropical <b>disturbances</b> were formed over the SCS from 1997 to 2006, with 54 developing tropical <b>disturbances</b> which developed into tropical depressions and 104 non-developing tropical <b>disturbances</b> which never developed into tropical depressions. The development rate of tropical <b>disturbances</b> into tropical depressions was 34. 18 % in these ten years. During the period of this study, total annual numbers of tropical <b>disturbances</b> and developing tropical <b>disturbances</b> over the SCS had significant decreasing trends; however, the development rate of tropical <b>disturbances</b> had an insignificant increasing trend. © 2011 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Kim {{originated}} from a weak tropical <b>disturbance</b> that formed {{to the northeast}} of Truk on October 9. Over the next few days, the <b>disturbance</b> persisted while moving west; however, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initially expected the <b>disturbance</b> to dissipate over the southern Philippines without further development. On October14, the <b>disturbance</b> became less organized over the Sulu Sea, only {{to move into the}} South China Sea the next day, where the <b>disturbance</b> was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC. By this time, the monsoon trough was well developed in the South China Sea and provided a favorable environment aloft for further development. At 18:00UTC on October15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>disturbance</b> formed {{south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the <b>disturbance</b> moved west for four days before attaining tropical depression status. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased {{in the vicinity of}} the storm. Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north along an adjacent upper-level low.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>disturbance</b> {{is named}} {{when it reaches}} moderate tropical storm strength. If a tropical <b>disturbance</b> reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm; between 55°E and 90°E, the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius {{is responsible for the}} same task.

30|$|The {{negative}} {{afternoon and}} evening <b>disturbances</b> in foF 2 {{are seen in}} the Millstone Hill digisonde and ISR observations during the entire considered period except the positive <b>disturbances</b> in the afternoon on September 10. The sign of these <b>disturbances</b> is {{in agreement with the}} GSM TIP calculations; however, the calculated positive and negative <b>disturbances</b> in foF 2 are much weaker than in the observations.

40|$|Although {{reduction}} of <b>disturbances</b> {{may result in}} productivity increase, some of the presumed gain may be diverted to other <b>disturbances.</b> There {{is a need to}} develop methods that provide {{a better understanding of the}} causes and actions of <b>disturbances</b> in manufacturing systems. Discrete-event simulation is used to analyze the effects of reduced <b>disturbances.</b> Two case studies from manufacturing companies in Sweden were carried out. The investigation shows that the best ways to decrease <b>disturbances</b> are to eliminate those resulting from long waiting times. It is suggested that the new allocation of <b>disturbances</b> be thoroughly investigated before efforts are taken to eliminate <b>disturbances</b> and increase total output...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>disturbance</b> {{was observed}} on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The <b>disturbance</b> tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the <b>disturbance</b> maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic <b>disturbance</b> and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human <b>disturbance,</b> suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new power quality {{monitoring}} (PQM) system for detection and classification of power quality voltage <b>disturbances</b> is presented. The {{implementation of the}} proposed PQM system in a graphical user interface (GUI) is also presented. The wavelet transform (WT) is used for de-noising and detection of the <b>disturbances</b> on power voltage line. Detected <b>disturbances</b> are separated using binary morphology feature extraction and classified according to the PQ <b>disturbances</b> definitions. The classification process {{is based on the}} <b>disturbances</b> knowledge base of the expert system. The considered PQ <b>disturbances</b> are: voltage sag, voltage swell, interruption, transient, voltage drop, noise and harmonics. The <b>disturbances</b> characteristics are considered according to IEEE standard 1159 - 1995. Also other characteristics as RMS value, frequency, time localization, duration and amplitude are considered. The proposed approach was implemented in Matlab and a GUI was created for easily controlling and automating classification of PQ <b>disturbances.</b> The proposed system consists of two GUI windows one for data simulation and acquisition and the second for the de-noising, detection and classification of simulated or acquired PQ <b>disturbances.</b> With the proposed GUI system it is possible to automatically classify simulated and measured PQ <b>disturbances</b> on power voltage line. ...|$|R
30|$|The two bottom rows in Fig. 3 {{show the}} foF 2 {{variations}} above the {{stations of the}} North-American longitudinal chain (Millstone Hill (42.6 N, 71.5 W) and Arecibo (18.3 N, 66.8 W)). According to both IRI- 2000 and GSM TIP, the negative <b>disturbances</b> in foF 2 at Millstone Hill are formed throughout the entire considered period. Exceptions are the <b>disturbances</b> in foF 2 at the daytime of September 10 and the nighttime of September 11 and 12, when GSM TIP shows positive <b>disturbances.</b> IRI- 2000 predicts negative foF 2 <b>disturbances</b> above Arecibo for all the days, whereas GSM TIP anticipates positive daytime <b>disturbances</b> for all the days and the positive nighttime <b>disturbances</b> on September 11 – 13. Thus, the IRI- 2000 model does not predict any foF 2 storm-time positive <b>disturbances</b> for all the considered stations.

3000|$|... {{observed}} by Th D {{show that the}} Pi 2 <b>disturbances</b> are exited in the plasma sheet prior to the auroral substorm expansion onset time of ~ 0404 : 30 UT (indicated by white dashed line), and the higher frequency Pi 1 <b>disturbances</b> started about tens of seconds later. The Pi 2 <b>disturbances</b> are also excited prior to the Pi 1 <b>disturbances</b> in the Th E data shown in Fig.  5 b. Similar results are found in many previous studies as well (e.g., Takahashi et al. 1987; Roux et al. 1991; Cheng and Lui 1998; Shiokawa et al. 2005; Saito et al. 2008). Because the excitation of the Pi 2 <b>disturbances</b> precedes the onset of substorm and the Pi 1 <b>disturbances,</b> we suggest that the Pi 2 <b>disturbances,</b> rather than the Pi 1 <b>disturbances,</b> {{are related to the}} cause of substorm arc formation and intensification during the pre-onset time.|$|R
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to <b>disturbance</b> of their root systems. Minimization of such <b>disturbance</b> will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disturbance</b> is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of <b>disturbance,</b> a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of <b>disturbance</b> is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 27, 1976, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{reported}} that a tropical <b>disturbance</b> had formed about 770km (480mi) to the southwest of San Jose, Costa Rica. During {{the next two days}} the <b>disturbance</b> slowly developed while moving northwest. By the morning of September 29, the <b>disturbance</b> was upgraded to a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm and based on ship reports and satellite imagery. Due {{to the fact that it}} attained tropical storm status, it was named Madeline. At this time, the cyclone had developed a center of circulation. Its intensification was short-lived and Madeline remained at tropical storm strength for just 12 hours before it was downgraded into a tropical depression. Madeline remained at tropical depression strength until September 30. At that time, the EPHC {{reported that}} the circulation center was no longer visible and downgraded the system to a remnant low, while located 575 mi (925 km) to the southeast of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the dynamic effects of demand and supply <b>disturbances</b> on the Finnish economy. In addition, the study aims at finding out whether {{liberalization}} of capital movements affected the transmission of <b>disturbances.</b> The analysis is based on a vector autoregressive model for unemployment and the GNP from 1970. 1 to 1990. 4. The vector autoregressive representation is then transformed to a corresponding moving average representation and the dynamic effects of <b>disturbances</b> are analyzed by impulse response functions. The model restricts the number of <b>disturbances</b> to two, called demand and supply <b>disturbances.</b> Estimation shows that demand <b>disturbances</b> have temporary effects on GNP and unemployment, the effects of supply <b>disturbances</b> on GNP are permanent but their effects on unemployment are temporary. As capital mobility increases the effects of demand <b>disturbances</b> die out faster. There is no significant difference in the short term effects of supply <b>disturbances</b> on GNP but the long term effects are magnified.
