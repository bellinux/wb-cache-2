5|$|The 5th Guards Army and 5th Guards Tank Army of the Steppe Front {{had been}} brought up from reserve and reassigned to the Voronezh Front on 8 and 11 July respectively. On 11 July, Vatutin ordered the armies of the Voronezh Front to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{offensive}} on the following day. This Soviet counterattack on the southern side of the Kursk salient was planned {{to coincide with the}} offensive against Orel on the northern side, Operation Kutuzov. Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to destroy the German forces near Prokhorovka with his 5th Guards Tank Army, without allowing the German forces to withdraw southward.|$|E
25|$|Leaving Marshals Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier {{to watch}} Blücher, Napoleon rapidly {{transferred}} his strength southward against Schwarzenberg's army. The French emperor arrived at Guignes {{on the evening}} of 16 February and planned to launch his offensive the next day. He found the army of Victor and Oudinot in good order and prepared to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive.|$|E

It was Lauzon who had earlier prevented two-thirds of the Indians from moving away and settling within easy reach of the English, and therefore Rigaud urged the superior to send him back. In 1722 Lauzon returned to Sault St. Louis.|$|E

25|$|No Glaswegian {{troops were}} deployed, with the {{government}} fearing that fellow Glaswegians, soldiers or otherwise, might <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> workers' side if a revolutionary situation developed. Under the orders of Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, Scottish regiments were transported to Glasgow {{from other parts of}} Scotland, specifically to avert this possible scenario. Troops from the Highland Light Infantry were also transported from Maryhill Barracks from Maryhill Central railway station to Buchanan Street railway station but without their Glaswegian men. Other troops, including the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, Gordon Highlanders and Seaforth Highlanders, arrived from Stirling Castle, Redford Barracks and Fort George into Queen Street Station.|$|E
25|$|West of Lake Rudolf, the 25th East African Brigade (Brig. W. Owen) {{marched on}} Namaraputh with the {{objective}} of taking the town of Kalam (Map 1: Point 4). Opposition from Merille tribesman in the area was so fierce, that the Brigade was compelled to cease its advance and to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defensive. Any advance west of the lake would first require wide area operations to subdue these irregular forces. By the time Moyale fell, allied forces had captured Mogadishu to the east and this success encouraged General Wavell to advise Cunningham that the South African division should be readied to deploy to Egypt at short notice. Cunningham thus replaced 2nd and 5th Brigades with the 21st East African Brigade and withdrew them back into Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Now {{expand the}} {{situation}} to have one sentient being observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, {{and that is what}} the mind sees. When this observer goes over to the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see the expected results. However, the observers mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state - there is just no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second detector.|$|E

25|$|To defeat Guderian, {{the newly}} formed Bryansk Front under Andrey Yeremenko sought to {{encircle}} Guderian’s spearhead. It was given the best Soviet equipment, and new T-34 tanks to do the job. He was also assigned the new VVS Bryansk Front under Fydor Polynin. The front had 464 combat aircraft. In August 1941 the new Stavka Reserves, indicated the Soviet ability to replace losses, including six RAG (Reserve Aviation Groups) equipped with the most modern aircraft. It was also supplemented by aircraft from flight schools, from the Transcaucasus Military District, from the Moscow PVO and the naval air forces. The VVS formations suffered high losses against the veteran German formations, JG 51, losing 35 aircraft on 27 August. Fliegerkorps II’s bombers delayed reinforcements through interdiction. But when the Soviets did strike on 29 August, it compelled Guderian to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{next week}} saw the 6th Airborne Division, serving {{as part of}} Lieutenant General John Crocker's I Corps, engaged in almost {{constant}} fighting, notably at Bréville, {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Germans from driving the Allies back into the sea. After mid-June, when German counterattacks ceased, the division, reinforced by the 1st and 4th Special Service Brigades, spent the next two months in a static defence role, holding a nine thousand yard front southwards from the sea. In mid-August, with the situation in Normandy turning against the Germans and forcing them to withdraw to Falaise, the division was ordered to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive and pursued to the Germans to the Seine, in nine days advancing some 45 miles, capturing 400 square miles of enemy territory and over 1,000 German soldiers, despite the belief of Crocker, the corps commander, and Gale himself, that the division was poorly equipped for a rapid pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box {{in the middle of the}} room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

25|$|By 1693 the French {{army had}} reached an {{official}} size of over 400,000 men (on paper), but Louis XIV was facing an economic crisis. France and northern Italy witnessed severe harvest failures resulting in widespread famine which, {{by the end}} of 1694, had accounted for the deaths of an estimated two million people. Nevertheless, as a prelude to offering generous peace terms before the Grand Alliance Louis XIV planned to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive: Luxembourg would campaign in Flanders, Catinat in northern Italy, and in Germany, where Louis XIV had hoped for a war-winning advantage, Marshal de Lorge would attack Heidelberg. In the event, Heidelberg fell on 22 May before Luxembourg's army took to the field in the Netherlands, but the new Imperial commander on the Rhine, Prince Louis of Baden, provided a strong defence and prevented further French gains. Luxembourg had better luck in the Low Countries, however. After taking Huy on 23 July, the French commander outmanoeuvred William III, catching him off-guard between the villages of Neerwinden and Landen. The ensuing engagement on 29 July was a close and costly encounter but French forces, whose cavalry once again showed their superiority, prevailed. Luxembourg and Vauban proceeded to take Charleroi on 10 October which, together with the earlier prizes of Mons, Namur and Huy, provided the French with a new and impressive forward line of defence.|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{authorities}} in St. Augustine and Pensacola mobilized their meager forces, {{but did not}} return to Ayubale until after Moore's force had clearly left the area. [...] They buried the Christian dead, many of whom they reported as exhibiting evidence of torture. [...] Despite the losses, they did not immediately abandon or consolidate the missions until further raiding took place, after which the demoralized surviving Apalachee insisted they would either retreat to Pensacola or <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English.|$|E
500|$|Belisarius {{knew that}} success for his {{expedition}} relied on gaining {{the support of}} the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies and <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (The Vandalic War, I.17), [...] "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did anything out of the way, and , by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".|$|E

500|$|The serious losses {{sustained}} in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg {{had been replaced}} by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted. Gerd von Rundstedt, soon followed, that evening, in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, head of OKW, von Rundstedt said [...] "Make peace, you fools." [...] Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied [...] "If you doubt what we're doing, get up here and take over this shambles yourself". The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was [...] "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge. The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct. The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter-attacks and <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.|$|E

2500|$|From the outset, {{the joint}} {{expedition}} {{that was now}} planned {{should not be a}} purely military affair. Pitt assumed that, like the Italian and Swiss populations, the Dutch would enthusiastically support the invasion against the French. According to the British historian Simon Schama: [...] "Once the Orange standard had been raised, he seems to have believed that the Batavian army would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forces of the Coalition to the last man and that its Republic would collapse under the barest pressure."

Given that Gordon himself in his interview with Stead had stated: [...] "The moment it is known that we have given up the game, every man will <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mahdi", his decision to reveal that the Egyptians were pulling out remains inexplicable. Shortly afterwards, Gordon wrote what Urban called a [...] "bizarre" [...] letter to the Mahdi telling him to accept the authority of the Khedive of Egypt and offering him the chance to work as one of Gordon's provincial governors. The Mahdi contemptuously rejected Gordon's offer and sent back a letter demanding Gordon convert to Islam.|$|E
