5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Köln operated <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 helicopters as an experiment. She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union in 1941, and returned to Norway in 1942. Ultimately, she was sunk in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945 by American bombers. Her guns were still above water, which allowed her to support the defending German army against British ground forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Drache {{was also}} used for {{shipboard}} trials with the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) helicopter. She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|The three ships all {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1939. After the outbreak of war, {{they were used to}} lay defensive minefields along with Emden, and in April 1940, {{participated in the}} invasion of Norway. Two of the three cruisers, Karlsruhe and Königsberg, were sunk during the invasion; Karlsruhe was torpedoed by a British submarine off Kristiansand and Königsberg was sunk by British divebombers in Bergen. Köln was used in a variety of roles after the conclusion of the campaign, including as a testbed for operating the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 helicopter at sea. She was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, though she sank in shallow water on an even keel, which allowed her guns to provide gunfire support to German troops {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Köln was {{the only}} ship of the class to survive the {{operations}} off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified {{to serve as a}} testbed for the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank on an even keel, with her guns still above water, which permitted their use against advancing British forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained on an even keel, with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 Anton <b>Flettner,</b> a German aero-engineer, {{was brought}} to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He was the {{developer}} of the two earlier synchropter designs from Germany during World War II: the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 265 which pioneered the synchropter layout, and the slightly later <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird"), intended for eventual production. Both designs used the principle of counter-rotating side-by-side intermeshing rotors, as the means {{to solve the problem of}} torque compensation, normally countered in single–rotor helicopters by a tail rotor, fenestron, NOTAR, or vented blower exhaust. <b>Flettner</b> remained in the United States and became the chief designer of the Kaman company.|$|E
25|$|He {{started to}} design new helicopters, using the <b>Flettner</b> double rotor.|$|E
25|$|Savonius wind turbine: These are drag-type devices {{with two}} (or more) scoops {{that are used}} in anemometers, <b>Flettner</b> vents (commonly seen on bus and van roofs), and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines. They are always {{self-starting}} if {{there are at least three}} scoops.|$|E
25|$|Viking Line {{revealed}} in November 2016, that {{a letter of}} intent had been signed with Chinese shipyard Xiamen Shipbuilding {{for the construction of}} a 63,000 GT cruiseferry that would on completion replace the Amorella in the Viking Line fleet. The new ship would be LNG powered and would sport <b>Flettner</b> rotors to reduce fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945, the Air Ministry {{assigned}} {{the other three}} Drachen to Transportstaffel 40 (TS/40) at Mühldorf, Bavaria, the Luftwaffe's only operational helicopter squadron, equipped with at least five <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282s {{as well as the}} Drachen. TS/40 relocated to various sites before ending up at Ainring in Germany, where one of the Drachen was destroyed by its pilot to prevent it being captured and the other two were seized by US forces.|$|E
25|$|Some {{versions}} of the G-6 and later Gs had a taller, wood-structure tail unit and redesigned rudder which improved stability at high speeds. The introduction of the WGr. 21cm (8in) under-wing mortar/rockets and the 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannon increased firepower. Certain production batches of the Bf 109G were fitted with aileron <b>Flettner</b> tabs to decrease stick forces at high speeds. A radio-navigational method, the Y-Verführung (Y-Guidance) was introduced with the FuG 16ZY.|$|E
500|$|Köln {{took part}} in Operation Weserübung, the {{invasion}} of Norway, in April 1940. She was assigned Group 3, tasked with the assault on Bergen, along with her sister Königsberg. She reached the harbor unscathed, but Königsberg was not so lucky; she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal guns. Köln nevertheless supported the German infantry ashore with her main guns. After the port was secured, she returned to Germany, along {{with a pair of}} destroyers. In late 1940, she went into drydock for further modifications. A degaussing coil was installed, along with a helicopter landing platform on top of turret [...] "Bruno". She thereafter served as a testbed for the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 helicopter, a task she performed until 1942.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden {{empennage}} was conventional, {{with a wire}} braced, {{constant chord}} tailplane mounted around one third fin height; its construction {{was similar to that}} of the wing. A photograph from mid-1934, at about the time of its first flight, shows the 110 with a trapezoidal fin, {{similar to that of the}} earlier CAMS 55. [...] Both the vertical-edged rudder and elevators had full-span, <b>Flettner</b> type servo tabs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{conventional}} rudder the Habicht had drag rudders. [...] These were leading edge flaps placed near the tips and formed by mounting the leading edge surfaces on a hinge so they could open upwards and downwards (those of the Horten H.I had extended downwards only). [...] Their differential operational controlled yaw and they served as conventional airbrakes when opened together. The whole trailing edge was occupied by control surfaces; the outer panels had elevons outboard and landing flaps inboard and there were further landing flaps on the centre section. Rear control surfaces were assisted by <b>Flettner</b> servo tabs and were ply covered.|$|E
2500|$|Externally the K series {{could be}} {{identified}} by changes in {{the locations of the}} radio equipment hatch, which was moved forward and to a higher position between frames four and five and the filler point for the fuselage fuel tank, which was moved forward to a location between frames two and three. The D/F loop was moved aft to sit between frames three and four on the fuselage spine and a small circular plate above the footstep on the port side of the fuselage was deleted. The rudder was fitted as standard with a <b>Flettner</b> tab and two fixed tabs although some rare examples were not fitted with the fixed tabs. All K-4s were to be fitted with a long retractable tail wheel (...) with two small clamshell doors covering the recess when the tail-wheel was retracted.|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{featured}} the large rectangular fairings {{for the large}} [...] main wheels. Small wheel well doors, originally planned for the G series, were fitted to the outer ends of the wheel bays, covering the outer wheels when retracted. These doors were often removed by front-line units. The radio equipment was the FuG 16ZY with the relocated main swept-forward radio antenna under the port wing from the G-10 being carried through as the standard for the K-series airframes. The FuG 25a Erstling IFF system, {{as well as the}} FuG 125 Hermine D/F equipment were also fitted. Internally, the oxygen bottles were relocated from the rear fuselage to the right wing. <b>Flettner</b> tabs for the ailerons were also to be fitted to serial production aircraft to reduce control forces but were extremely rare, with the majority of the K-4s using the same aileron system as the G series.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 <b>Flettner,</b> {{together}} with Kurt Hohenemser, built the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 265. [...] The <b>Flettner</b> Fl 265 addressed the probable of torque compensation {{as the first}} helicopter with counter-rotating rotors (<b>Flettner</b> double rotor).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flettner</b> started <b>Flettner</b> Aircraft Corporation, which {{developed}} helicopters for the U.S. military. In 1949, <b>Flettner</b> employed Kurt Hohenemser {{as a consultant}} to the <b>Flettner</b> Aircraft Corporation. [...] <b>Flettner</b> and Kurt Hohenemser, who together developed numerous patents in Germany, kept in close contact after both men emigrated to the United States.|$|E
5000|$|In 1926, Anton <b>Flettner</b> {{shifted his}} focus to {{aviation}} in founding his own company, the Anton <b>Flettner</b> Aircraft Corporation in Berlin, aiming at {{the application of}} the Flettner-rotor as a wing replacement on large wind turbines. In 1935, <b>Flettner</b> built a German night reconnaissance and anti-submarine autogyro called the Fl 184. [...] <b>Flettner</b> followed this accomplishment by building the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 185 in 1936, an experimental German gyrodyne, which could fly as both a helicopter and as a gyroplane.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flettner</b> Fl 265 was an {{experimental}} helicopter designed by Anton <b>Flettner.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird") is a single-seat {{intermeshing}} rotor helicopter, or synchropter, {{produced by}} Anton <b>Flettner</b> of Germany. According to Yves Le Bec, the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282 was the world's first series production helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|Hohenemser and Anton <b>Flettner,</b> who {{together}} developed numerous patents in Germany, maintained {{close contact}} after both men {{emigrated to the}} United States. [...] During 1949, Anton <b>Flettner</b> employed Hohenemser {{as a consultant to}} the <b>Flettner</b> Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Anton <b>Flettner,</b> Flugzeugbau GmbH was a German {{helicopter}} and autogyro manufacturer during World War II, founded by Anton <b>Flettner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Following World War I, <b>Flettner</b> {{was named}} Managing Director of the Institute for Aero and Hydro Dynamics in Amsterdam. [...] He held that post until 1931. [...] In the 1920s, <b>Flettner</b> also invented the famous <b>Flettner</b> rotary ventilator, which was widely used on buses, vans, boats, {{railroad}} cars, campervans, and trucks to assist cooling {{without the use}} of energy. [...] Modern derivatives of his ventilator are still manufactured in Britain by <b>Flettner</b> Ventilator Limited.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Anton <b>Flettner</b> headed <b>Flettner</b> Flugzeubau GmbH, which {{specialized}} in reconnaissance helicopters for the German Luftwaffe (Air Force).|$|E
5000|$|At {{least two}} other <b>Flettner</b> {{helicopters}} were under development when World War II ended. [...] They were the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 285, another reconnaissance helicopter with a two-hour flight limit and capacity to carry two small bombs, and the <b>Flettner</b> Fl 339, a large transport helicopter project designed for approximately 20 passengers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flettner</b> {{became the}} chief {{designer}} of Kaman Aircraft {{and many of}} the <b>Flettner</b> design concepts are found in Kaman helicopters of later years.|$|E

5000|$|Upon the war's conclusion, Anton <b>Flettner</b> {{was held}} in the [...] "Dustbin" [...] {{interrogation}} camp at Kransberg Castle. [...] After 1945, <b>Flettner,</b> along with many other aviation pioneers, was brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. [...] <b>Flettner</b> and his partner, Dr. Kurt Hohenemser, were among the first German emigrants into the United States after World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Intermeshing rotors also turn in {{opposite}} directions, but rotate {{into each other}} without colliding. Invented by Anton <b>Flettner</b> and used in <b>Flettner</b> Fl 282, Kaman HH-43 Huskie, and Kaman K-MAX.|$|E
50|$|Anton <b>Flettner,</b> after {{whom the}} rotor is named, used it {{successfully}} as the sails of a ship, and also projected a <b>Flettner</b> airplane. There is {{no record of}} it having been made.|$|E
50|$|The third design {{considered}} is the <b>Flettner</b> Rotor. This {{is a large}} cylinder mounted {{upright on}} a ship's deck and mechanically spun. The effect of this spinning area {{in contact with the}} wind flowing around it creates a thrust effect that is used to propel the ship. <b>Flettner</b> Rotors were invented in the 1920s and have seen limited use since then. In 2010 a 10,000 dwt cargo ship was equipped with four <b>Flettner</b> Rotors to evaluate their role in increasing fuel efficiency. The only parameter of the <b>Flettner</b> Rotor requiring control is the speed of the rotor's rotation, so this method of wind propulsion requires very little operator input. In comparison to kite sails, <b>Flettner</b> rotors offer very similar efficiency gains {{depending on the size of}} sail used vs. size of the rotor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flettner</b> rotor {{comprises}} a Magnus cylinder with a disc endplate at each end. The American Plymouth A-A-2004 floatplane had <b>Flettner</b> rotors {{in place}} of the main wings and achieved short flights in 1924.|$|E
50|$|Anton Flettner's {{interest}} in aerodynamics (specifically the Magnus effect, which produces a force from a cylinder rotating in a fluid flow) also {{led him to}} invent the <b>Flettner</b> rotor which he used to power a <b>Flettner</b> ship which crossed the Atlantic, and the <b>Flettner</b> ventilator which is still widely used as a cooling device for buses, vans and other commercial vehicles and which {{is based upon the}} Savonius principle.|$|E
50|$|The most {{ubiquitous}} {{application of}} the Savonius wind turbine is the <b>Flettner</b> Ventilator, which is commonly seen on the roofs of vans and buses and {{is used as a}} cooling device. The ventilator was developed by the German aircraft engineer Anton <b>Flettner</b> in the 1920s. It uses the Savonius wind turbine to drive an extractor fan. The vents are still manufactured in the UK by <b>Flettner</b> Ventilator Limited.|$|E
