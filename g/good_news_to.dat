25|$|At {{the annual}} general meeting, held in July 1833, there was <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>to</b> report. Crosley {{had left the}} {{employment}} of the canal company on 24 June, but had produced a detailed report {{on the condition of}} the works before he left, in which he stated that there was no observable settlement in the embankments, the stonework of the locks, bridges and aqueducts was still good and showing no signs of failure, and the reservoir at Bosley had been filled to the top of several occasions, without any sign of leakage. Edward Stanley, the chairman of the management committee, reported that trade was brisk, and that 98,201.5 tons of cargo had been carried in the first full year of operation (March 1832-March 1833), generating an income of £6,117. Even a reduction in the rates being charged, to bring them in line with other canals, had not resulted in an appreciable fall in income. The company had built six wharfs, and was building a seventh at Bosley, four of which also had warehouses. In addition, ten houses had been built, for use by various members of staff, and offices had been constructed at Macclesfield. The company had bought the land for a second reservoir at Sutton and had already built the feeders to link it to the canal.|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>to</b> my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E

We give an example where <b>good</b> <b>news</b> leads <b>to</b> the adoption of a more pessimistic course of action (we say that action a ~ reveals greater pessimism than action a 2, if it gives higher payoff in bad environments and lower payoff in good environments).

2500|$|Redemptorist spirituality {{consists}} of the Crib, the Cross, and the Sacrament. In other words, the Redemptorists follow Christ in his incarnation, death, and resurrection and {{believe that he is}} always with them. They emphasize the encounter with Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, and have their founder's popular version of the Way of the Cross and the Christmas carols which he composed. With a practical focus, Redemptorist spirituality would render help to the those in dire spiritual or material need, based on Jesus' invitation to follow him. One of the most tangible ways they do this is to proclaim the Gospel in simple ways to ordinary people, taking as their motto Jesus' words when he quoted Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…. to preach <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> <b>to</b> the poor,… liberty to captives,… sight to the blind,… to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour (Luke 4:18-19).|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Limbo of the Patriarchs" [...] or [...] "Limbo of the Fathers" [...] (Latin limbus patrum) {{is seen as}} the {{temporary}} state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter Heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible. The term [...] "Limbo of the Fathers" [...] was a medieval name for the part of the underworld (Hades) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ's soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them (see Harrowing of Hell). The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ's descent into hell as meaning primarily that [...] "the crucified one sojourned {{in the realm of the}} dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead." [...] It adds: [...] "But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> <b>to</b> the spirits imprisoned there." [...] It does not use the word [...] "Limbo".|$|E
2500|$|If God is ever to {{wipe away}} the tears {{from the face of}} man this age-long wrong [...] must be overthrown. If the mission of Jesus is ever to get the upperhand in human affairs, the social {{revolution}} must come to pass. There is no more <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>to</b> the poor unless there is the message and the task to abolish this age-long night of poverty. There is no deliverance for captives unless this social captivity is ended. There is no setting at liberty the people that are bruised unless this age-long bruising machinery is stopped. If we are ever to call the poor and the maimed and the halt to the banquet of creation, the program of the revolution must be inaugurated. The Heavenly Father may know we have need of all these things, and He may have provided for these needs in the limitless resources of nature, but we never can have them for the people except by seeking the kingdom of social justice and human brotherhood — which is the Kingdom of God — which is the social vision of the social revolution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the neutrality of the narrative discussion of financial performance and position, as evidenced in 179 annual reports of UK listed companies. Neutrality of narrative discussion was determined by comparing the average proportions of <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> contained in the narrative and statutory accounts sections of the annual reports. The results of a comparison of the proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> in the two sections of the annual reports suggest that the narrative sections contained a significantly higher proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> than the statutory accounts sections. Comparison of proportions of bad news, however, indicates that the narrative sections contained a significantly lower proportion of bad <b>news</b> compared <b>to</b> the statutory accounts sections. Finally, the results also suggest that the proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> as compared <b>to</b> bad <b>news</b> in the narrative sections is significantly higher than the proportion of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> compared <b>to</b> bad <b>news</b> in the statutory accounts section.

Specifically, the asset price overreacts <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and underreacts <b>to</b> bad <b>news</b> when the total representativeness heuristic minus the total conservatism bias in the market is greater than zero but less than one; otherwise, the asset price underreacts <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> and overreacts <b>to</b> bad <b>news...</b>|$|R
