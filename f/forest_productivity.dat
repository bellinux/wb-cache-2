40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to substantially affect <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity.</b> However, its effects may {{vary depending on the}} climate scenario, region and tree species. We chose Larix olgensis in northeast China to investigate the responses of <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity</b> to regional climate change using a generalized additive model (GAM). Based on site index data and climate variables from 335 townships across the Jilin Province, we developed a climate-sensitive forest site index model, which accounted for 72. 9 % of the variation in the site index at the referred age of 20 (SI 20). Our results indicated that climatic and geographic factors significantly affect <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity.</b> The geographic location, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and mean temperature differential were found to be statistically significant explanatory variables. We predict that the change of mean SI 20 would vary from 0. 3 m to - 0. 8 m (2. 2 % to - 5. 9 %) by 2050 and from 0. 5 m to - 1. 6 m (3. 7 % to - 11. 8 %) by 2070 under three BC-RCP scenarios with rising temperature and increasing precipitation. Our study suggests that climate is an important factor affecting <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity.</b> Future climate changes could affect the <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity</b> both positively and negatively for Larix olgensis in northeast China. The relationship between climate and <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity</b> has strong implications for adaptive forest management and needs to be considered in forest management planning under future climate change...|$|R

25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase <b>forest</b> <b>productivity,</b> accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E

50|$|Forest gap models like FORMIND {{can be used}} {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> and tree species diversity. Recent studies have shown that <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> typically increases with increasing tree species diversity. However, several studies show unchanged or even inverse relationships between productivity and diversity. We studied a broader range of diversity-productivity relationships. Instead of long-term simulations, thousands of different virtual forest stands have been generated, combining different species mixtures with various forest structures (e.g., different basal area values or heterogenic tree heights). For each of these virtual forest stands, <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> can be calculated using forest gap models. The obtained diversity - productivity relationships can then be compared to field studies. This new way of using a forest gap model as an analysis tool of virtual forest stands enables a much faster analysis of numerous forests compared with the classical method of simulating forest successions.|$|E

50|$|Growth ring {{measurements}} {{during the}} Cretaceous {{can also provide}} details of what the climate might have been like in various geographic locations on Earth. Pattern analysis of tree rings or growth rings from Cretaceous fossil woods are mainly used to make inferences into paleoclimate and <b>forest</b> <b>productivity.</b> One very useful scientific method used for tree growth ring dating is dendrochronology. However, {{most of the studies}} conducted on fossilized wood rely on the idea that processes related to tree growth rates that operated in the past are identical to the processes that operate in the present, uniformitarianism. On this basis, <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> can be inferred from the analysis of growth rings in Cretaceous trees. Analysis of <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> from the Cretaceous shows that annual tree growth rates at low paleolatitudes were significantly elevated relative to the present. In the polar paleolatitudes, growth rate analysis also indicates elevated productivity, but even more significantly improved relative to today. Dendrochronology of fossilized wood growth rings from high paleolatitudes suggests the presence of greenhouse-like climatic conditions on a global scale during this time period.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} main factors that {{contribute}} to net forest productivity: carbon dioxide concentration, root respiration rates, temperature and photosynthesis. carbon dioxide alone tends to decrease leaf and root respiration by lowering the light compensation point of photosynthesis, allowing for a net positive gain in carbon intake {{during the course of a}} day. The reduction of root respiration tends to initiate root growth and ultimately results in an improvement in nutrient and water uptake efficiency. When photosynthesis is added to the effects of carbon dioxide, depending on regional temperature, <b>forest</b> <b>productivity</b> is drastically increased. The combination of all four physiological factors results in a significant net increase in <b>forest</b> <b>productivity.</b> According to experimental results, tree species with long lived evergreen foliage tend to benefit the greatest in a carbon dioxide rich environment because of their longer growing season and adaptations like canopy development that allow them to thrive in the temperate polar paleolatitudes of the Cretaceous.|$|E
40|$|Landscape and {{environmental}} {{variables such as}} topography, geomorphology, soil types, and climate are important factors affecting <b>forest</b> composition, structure, <b>productivity,</b> and biomass.

We use the RAINFOR network of forest plots distributed in lowland forests across Amazonia, and satellite observations of tree cover, leaf area index, phenology, moisture, and topographical variations. A maximum entropy estimation (Maxent) model is employed to predict the spatial distribution of several key forest structure parameters: basal area, fraction of large trees, fraction of palms, wood density, productivity, and above-ground biomass at 5 km spatial resolution.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of <b>forest</b> site <b>productivity</b> {{are essential for}} environmental planning and forest management. In this study, we developed a new productivity index, hereafter termed basal area potential productivity index (BAPP), to estimate site productivity for irregular and complex forests characterized by multi-aged, multi-species, and multi-layer stands. We presented the biological relevance of BAPP with its computational details. We also compared BAPP against basal area realized productivity (BARP) in order to verify the practicability and reliability of BAPP. Time-series data of the national forest inventory on 1912 permanent sample plots that were located in two main forest types and consisted of oak-dominated mixed forests and other broadleaf forests in northeast China were used to demonstrate the application of BAPP.
