5000|$|Among the Mohawk chiefs {{who lived}} in the area were Ron-warrigh-woh-go-wa (meaning in English the great <b>fault</b> <b>finder</b> or grumbler), Ka-na-da-rokh-go-wa (a great eater), Ro-ya-na (a chief), As-sa-ve-go (big knife), and A-voon-ta-go-wa (big tree). Of these, the first {{strongly}} objected to selling communal lands to the whites. He ensured that the Mohawk retained the rights of hunting and fishing on lands they deeded to the Dutch and other whites. He was reported to have said that [...] "after the whites had taken possession of our lands, they will make Kaut-sore spoon-food or soup of our bodies." [...] He generally aided the settlers during the mid-18th century against the Canadiens in the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War.The first European settlers of this town were Dutch colonists who chose to locate outside the manor of Rensselaerwyck to avoid the oversight of the patroons and the trading government of New Netherland. Harmon Vedder obtained a patent for some land here in 1664, soon after the founders in 1661 gained land in what developed as the village and city of Schenectady. The traders of Fort Orange retained their monopoly, forbidding the settlers in the Schenectady area from fur trading. They developed mostly as farmers.|$|E

A new F 3 (Fast <b>Fault</b> <b>Finder)</b> VME module has been developed to process both fast and slow interlocks using FPGA logic to detect the interlock trip excursions. This combination {{eliminates the need for}} separate PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) control of slow interlocks. Modules are chained together to accommodate as many inputs as needed. In the next phase of development the F 3 ’s will be ported to the new industry standard ATCA (Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture) crate (shelf) via a specially designed VME adapter module with IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). The goal is to demonstrate autofailover and hot-swap for future partially redundant systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} VanarSena, an automated <b>fault</b> <b>finder</b> for mobile applications (``apps''). The techniques in VanarSena are driven by a study of 25 million real-world crash reports of Windows Phone apps reported in 2012. Our analysis indicates that a modest number of root causes are responsible for many observed failures, but that they occur {{in a wide range}} of places in an app, requiring a wide coverage of possible execution paths. VanarSena adopts a ``greybox'' testing method, instrumenting the app binary to achieve both coverage and speed. VanarSena runs on cloud servers: the developer uploads the app binary; VanarSena then runs several app ``monkeys'' in parallel to emulate user, network, and sensor data behavior, returning a detailed report of crashes and failures. We have tested VanarSena with 3000 apps from the Windows Phone store, finding that 1108 of them had failures; VanarSena uncovered 2969 distinct bugs in existing apps, including 1227 that were not previously reported. Because we anticipate VanarSena being used in regular regression tests, testing speed is important. VanarSena uses two techniques to improve speed. First, it uses a ``hit testing'' method to quickly emulate an app by identifying which user interface controls map to the same execution handlers in the code. Second, it generates a ProcessingCompleted event to accurately determine when to start the next interaction. These features are key benefits of VanarSena's greybox philosophy.

40|$|The {{judiciary}} 2 ̆ 7 s role {{in divorce}} related child custody disputes {{has been transformed}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century in response to the changing characteristics of American families, changing perceptions of the needs of children, and an overwhelming case load increase. The transformation occurred in two distinct phases, and a third is currently in process. In Phase I, from the late 1960 s (the beginning of widespread 2 ̆ 2 no fault 2 ̆ 2 divorce) to 1980, the child custody court was a <b>fault</b> <b>finder</b> functioning through adversary procedure. The court 2 ̆ 7 s job was to identify a single custodial parent and assign that parent primary legal rights to the child after a trial about which parent was a better custodian for the child. Phase I courts conceived of a custody dispute much like a will contest. The parents 2 ̆ 7 marriage, like the decedent, was dead. Parents, like the heirs, were in dispute about the distribution of one of the assets of the estate [...] their children. The Phase I court 2 ̆ 7 s role was, after trial, to determine which heir/parent was more morally or psychologically worthy to control the children. The goal of the proceeding was a one time determination of custody 2 ̆ 2 rights 2 ̆ 2 which created 2 ̆ 2 stability 2 ̆ 2 for the future management of the asset. The winner was, however, largely predetermined by gender biased substantive standards that eliminated the seeming indeterminancy of the 2 ̆ 2 best interests 2 ̆ 2 test. Once the court distributed custody rights, its role in facilitating the ongoing process of reorganizing the child 2 ̆ 7 s relationships with both parents was over, except for the enforcement or modification of its initial award, tasks also accomplished through adversary process...|$|E
