40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation of two-phase flow for a dielectric liquid electromagneticf lowmeter. So far only limited investigationsi nto the possibleu se of electromagneticf lowmeters for multiphasef low measuremenht ave been made. These have been restricted to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> designed for conducting water based (electrolytic) fluids. The possibility of designing <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> for use with insulating (dielectric) fluids such as oil and petrol has been existed for some years. However the measuremenot f two-phase flow of insulating fluids using <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> {{and the application of}} this knowledge to the measurement of the separate phases has not yet been a subject for research. An analytical model is developed which evaluates a transformer signal that is produced on the electrodes when a bubble unbalances eddy currents while it passes through the meter. The shape and magnitude of this signal for various positions in the pipe cross-section is investigated. The behaviour of this transformer signal for various electrode shapes is studied as well and it is found that when using large area electrodes the position of the amplitude along the pipe axis remains almost constant. For measuring the speed of bubbles passing through the meter a frequency analysis is carried out and shows that the peak frequency of the signal is proportional to the velocity of the bubbles. A flowmeter is built to carry out experimental work. The first sets of experiments are carried out with plastic beads fixed on a thin string which is attached around two wheels. The speed of the beads is adjusted by an electromotor which powered one wheel. In a second experimental design gas bubbles are injected in a vertical pipe which is filled with dielectric oil. Both types of experiments exhibit the behaviour predicted in theoretical analysis...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} the simultaneous measurement of hepatic arterial and portal venous blood {{flow in the}} pentobarbital anesthetized rat by means of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeters.</b> Hepatic arterial flow was 0. 21 +/- 0. 02 mL/min/g liver, and portal venous flow was 1. 53 +/- 0. 19 mL/min/g liver (n = 20). Flows remained stable for more than 3 hr. A clear advantage of the electromagnetic technique {{is that it allows}} the continuous simultaneous separate measurement of hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flow. Simultaneous measurement of hepatic blood flow by the electromagnetic method and the microsphere method yielded almost identical results. Adenosine infusion (100 micrograms/min) did not affect hepatic blood flow measured electromagnetically nor via the microsphere technique. The suitability of indocyanine green (ICG) as an indicator of hepatic blood flow was evaluated by comparing the ICG clearance at steady-state conditions to the values of liver flow obtained by direct electromagnetic measurement. ICG clearance was only 30 % of the electromagnetically measured blood flow. These data strongly suggest that ICG clearance does not reflect liver flow in the rat. Intravenous infusion of the vasoactive agents phenylephrine (2, 4, 10 micrograms/min during 5 min) and adenosine (20, 40, 200 micrograms/min) did not affect portal venous nor hepatic arterial flow, measured by the electromagnetic method, although brisk effects on mean arterial blood pressure were observed. This suggests autoregulatory responses of the hepatic vascular bed. The data suggest that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeters</b> may be used to measure portal venous and hepatic arterial flow simultaneously in anesthetized rats.

With {{regard to}} the problem that only single index {{has been used in}} {{assessment}} of reliability, a suitable comprehensive assessment method about reliability index of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> was established, and Mean Time To First Failure(MTTFF), Mean Time Between Failure(MTBF) and equivalent failure rate(D) were selected as the standards of reliability evaluation for the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> in this paper. Because many evaluation elements involved and failure information and evaluation indexes are fuzzy, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on entropy weight was introduced to quantify the qualitative evaluation indexes, and indexes weight were determined scientifically by using comprehensive evaluation obtained from combining a subjective expert’s evaluation weight with objective entropy weight. Two kinds of the domestically produced <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> were studied, the censored data obtained from the process of consumers’s use were analyzed, and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on entropy weight was used to evaluate the indexes of reliability in two kinds of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> comprehensively.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{improvement}} of the meter performance and power consumption of non-mechanical flowmeters such as the conventional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> and the fluidic oscillator. Each flowmeter is studied using Finite Element Modelling for the magnetic field, the virtual current and the fluid dynamics in order to simulate flow signal. The meter design of the conventional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> is modified to provide a better signal level by optimising the geometry of the flow channel and the magnetic field. The signal level increase can be used to reduce power consumption. This improvement provides a 1. 96 times greater signal or 51 % less power consumption for the conventional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> An alternative coil-less <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter</b> is proposed to reduce the energy consumption. A laminated magnetostrictive material/PZT piezoelectric material is used to control the magnetic field from a permanent magnet. Modelling is carried out to optimise the meter and the magnetic field control device. The device can provide a further reduction of 54. 7 % of energy usage over the improved conventional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The modelling of the fluidic oscillator is undertaken not only with the fluidic dynamics but also the flow signal by using the electromagnetic sensing technique.
