5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city.

It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress.

5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search.

5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> area {{of law and}} religion, Domingo has {{advocated}} for a theistically oriented conception of the secular legal system that is able to embrace non-theistic approaches.The core of the argument {{is the idea that}} secular legal systems should treat God, religion, and conscience with respect. Respect demands not only positive feelings or deference toward these realities, but also specific actions that express and reflect that appreciation. Of the secular legal system, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> God, respect requires recognition; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> religion, toleration; and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> conscience, accommodation.

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
