The song features guest vocals from gospel singer Mavis Staples and GOOD Music president and rapper Pusha T. The song was written by Albarn, on a train journey, when conceptualising the album, Pusha T wrote his verse upon meeting Albarn and Gorillaz co-collaborator Jamie Hewlett in London. The song tackles the subject of politics, specifically the inauguration of Donald Trump, {{in much the same}} way as their earlier song [...] "Hallelujah Money" [...] did. When speaking to Zane Lowe, who premiered the song on his Apple Music Beats 1 radio show, Pusha said [...] "When I <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> Damon begins to tell me to conceptualize the album as a party for the end of the world, like if Trump were to win. … I didn’t want to think about it, but that did give me a very colorful backdrop … I wrote from the perspective of this day … from the perspective of a Trump win." ...|$|E

The Chancellor's aide, Horst Teltschik later said: [...] "Once we knew about the SS dead at Bitburg - knowing that these SS people were seventeen to eighteen years of age, and knowing that some Germans were forced to become members of the SS, having no alternative - the question was, Should this be a reason to cancel?" [...] Reagan aide Robert McFarlane later said: [...] "Once Reagan learned that Kohl would really be badly damaged by a withdrawal, he said 'We can't do that; I owe him.'" [...] Prior to sending Deaver back to West Germany for the third time, just two days before the scheduled visit, Reagan told his deputy chief of staff: [...] "I know you and Nancy don't want me to go through with this, but I don't want you to change anything when you <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> because history will prove I'm right.

After Katherine suggests Susan and Mike invite her over for a barbecue, Susan tells her that because of everything that happened a barbecue will not happen. Katherine gets upset and informs Susan that she will have to sue Susan for reckless endangerment. Afraid of being sued, she agrees to invite Katherine over for brunch. Katherine goes over to Angie's to let her know the plan is working but she sees Angie looking at a picture of her mother who she says died.That night, Katherine calls Mike claiming to have a leak in her master bathroom but tells her he will stop by the next day. When he tells Susan it was Katherine, she tells him to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> right away. Susan goes with Mike which catches Katherine by surprise. Katherine lies and has Mike fix the garbage disposal instead. Curious, Susan goes into Katherine's bedroom and sees rose petals scattered around the room and lit candles. Katherine catches her and Susan accuses her of trying to seduce Mike but she informs Susan that she does this every night. Knowing it is a lie, Susan starts to call Mike since he used to spend the night so Katherine starts frantically blowing out all the candles and flushing the rose petals. They get into a fight and end up falling into the bathtub with Susan holding Katherine under the water. Katherine overhears Angie talking to her mother on a pre-paid cellphone but she lies and says it is her mother-in-law. Later, Angie informs Susan that Katherine cannot be trusted and is dangerous. When Angie asks Susan if she knew where Katherine was the night of Julie's attack, Susan wonders why she would hurt Julie. Angie tells her that she just married Mike and puts the idea that since it was dark and a woman came out of the house, Katherine did not know it was Julie but thought it was Susan.|$|E
40|$|One major {{challenge}} in moral {{theory has been}} to account for some intuitively striking moral differences between decision problems that involve conflicts of interest, and decision problems that do not. These differences come out clearly in rescue cases. Consider: One Person, One Island While idly steaming through an almost-deserted South Sea archipelago, I receive a distress call. Agatha has recently been stranded on a nearby island. Mine is the only boat in the area. If I do not <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> with my provisions then she will die of thirst {{in a day or}} two. There are two safe routes to her island, one to the west, the other to the east. Both will take about three hours … I check my map … no, the western route will take three hours, the eastern route two and a half hours. Agatha is in no danger of dying in the next three hours, but the quicker I get to her the happier she will be. So which way am I to go, east or west? Two People, Two Islands While idly steaming through the same archipelago, I receive another distress call. Andy and Ben have recently been stranded on nearby islands, one to my west and one to my east. Mine is the only boat in the area and, sadly, I have very limited supplies of fuel.

Gosh I wanted to be with you Easter Sunday. To be able to spend a whole day with you would be wonderful. It’s awful honey, I {{want to be with you}} so much and yet I want to get through with this training so I can <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and get back as quick as possible. Honey don’t try to talk me out of wanting to go overseas because you can’t. It may seem strange to you but I’m going to do my damndest [sic] to <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> so I can get back here quicker and we can start some sort of a normal life together. So far it’s been pretty abnormal, a little too much so I think. Honey, we’re not even leading a normal abnormal life together; - we’re not even together. And now if they don’t send us home until Sunday after telling us we’d go home Saturday for sure, that will top it off. God damn it I’m P. O. ’d. I’d like to get stinkin’ tonight. Well anyhow my gunnery has been better. I got 177 hits today, the best score in the squadron. I just hope it’s not luck and I can keep it up. We’re firing for record sometime this week and that’s the score that goes on my form 5, (the one they look at when it comes to handing out nice juicey [sic] assignments.) I wish they’d take our highest score ‘cause 177 hits, the way they score us, is about 185 % and all we need to qualify is 30 % or about 27 hits. Well keep your fingers crossed baby and wish me luck, you sure have given it to me so far. I haven’t heard from Steve he doesn’t know when I am. I’m going to drop him a line though. I think he’s in a pool at Moody Field. Tom’s not worried about his glasses. He’s glad you didn’t send them since the mail situation is so screwed up. Honey that regulation you told me about doesn’t apply to us while we’re students at T. T. U. But all the married ones live off the post anyhow, it’s o. k. as long as we pay for our room in the B. O. Q. I mean they just don’t say anything about it. I don’t see how those fellows are going to have their wifes down here, we’re restricted all the time we’re here, maybe they know somebody. Even if I could have gotten off the post every night there’d be no way to get to you, there’s no transportation here at all. I’m glad you like the Officer’s Club, it’s pretty dumpy compared to some of the ones I’ve seen though. The one at Spence was terrific, decorated just like Astor Bar. It was really nice, I was there once with my instructor. Are you going to move to the front room? We can oil the bed, or maybe sleep on the floor. I’ll get you a footlocker at Craig if they have any. Why don’t you get one at the P. X. ? I’m glad you sent for your radio, I was going to ask you to. I mailed you the letter you Mom mailed to us. I hope you didn’t mind me opening it. I hope I can be back by Saturday, and early enough to go to the dance at the club. That sounds swell to me honey. Stop dreaming about having babies will you? Those are bad dreams for the time being anyhow, the “time being” meaning the duration. I’ll call you Friday around five baby, Gosh I hope we leave Saturday. I love you angel, with all my heart. Take care of yourself and don’t gain too much weight. I love you. I’ll love you always- Yours devotedly Judd P. S. - Please excuse this scrawl, I’m writing on my sack. I love you.
