5|$|The <b>Fugue</b> in G minor, BWV 131a is a {{transcription}} for {{organ of}} the <b>fugue</b> from the closing movement of the cantata. Although the work has an BWV number, it is not certain that the arranger was Bach.|$|E
50|$|Roberday's {{most famous}} work is <b>Fugues</b> et caprices, a {{collection}} of organ pieces published in 1660 in Paris. The collection includes twelve four-voice <b>fugues,</b> of which numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 9 are paired with caprices, fast-paced pieces based on the subjects of their corresponding <b>fugues.</b> These too feature four-part counterpoint, although slightly less complex than that in the <b>fugues.</b> The <b>fugues</b> use subjects with extensive usage of longer note values, which are modified in the caprices to better suit their fast tempi. Many of the pieces feature multiple sections, with a few double <b>fugues</b> and some variation <b>fugues</b> present.|$|R

50|$|According to Lowens, the <b>fuguing</b> tunes {{created by}} these singing masters at first {{involved}} a separate <b>fuguing</b> section appended {{to the end}} of a complete psalm tune. Later, the <b>fuguing</b> became more integrated and eventually evolved to be the longer part of the song.|$|R
5|$|The first {{movement}} is scored for five-part choir, woodwinds and strings. As the Dresden Mass style required, it {{opens with a}} short homophonic section, followed by an extended <b>fugue</b> in two sections, which both begin with an instrumental <b>fugue.</b>|$|E
5|$|The final Halleluja is faster, {{giving up}} the fantasia format for a four-part <b>fugue</b> and in motet style, with all {{instruments}} doubling the voices. The style of the movement recalls the 16th-century stile antico, although the style is still unmistakably Bach's.|$|E
5|$|The first {{landmarks}} of this mature style are {{the group}} of piano works published in 1907–1912 (the Elegies, the suite An die Jugend and the first two piano sonatinas) and Busoni's first completed opera, Die Brautwahl; together with the rather different Bach homage, the 1910 Fantasia contrappuntistica, Busoni's largest work for solo piano. About half an hour in length, it is essentially an extended fantasy on the final incomplete <b>fugue</b> from Bach's The Art of <b>Fugue.</b> It uses several melodic figures found in Bach's work, most notably the BACH motif. Busoni revised the work {{a number of times}} and arranged it for two pianos.|$|E

50|$|There is good {{evidence}} that by 1760, English tune books including <b>fuguing</b> tunes were circulating in the American colonies; the first English <b>fuguing</b> tune printed in America {{appeared in the}} hymnbook Urania, or A Choice Collection of Psalm-Tunes, Anthems, and Hymns by James Lyon. Soon, <b>fuguing</b> tunes were being written in great profusion by American—especially New England—composers. Karl Kroeger (see reference below) has documented the publication of almost 1300 <b>fuguing</b> tunes during the period 1750-1820. Among the principal composers of New England <b>fuguing</b> tunes Irving Lowens lists the following: William Billings, Daniel Read, Jacob French, Timothy Swan, Stephen Jenks, Supply Belcher, Abraham Maxim, Lewis Edson, Joseph Stone, Elisha West, Justin Morgan, and Daniel Belknap.|$|R
50|$|Single-section <b>fugues</b> are all monothematic. Their {{subjects}} are typical ricercar subjects: slow, sustained, moving in whole, half- and quarter notes. In two section <b>fugues</b> either both sections are imitative, or {{the second one}} is in free counterpoint. Fuga quinta's three sections are all imitative, {{but the rest of}} three-section <b>fugues</b> feature an imitative section, a stretto/canzona subject section and a free counterpoint section for the ending. In all, Lohet's pieces represent some of the earliest keyboard <b>fugues</b> in the modern understanding of the word.|$|R
5|$|The vast {{movement}} has aspects {{of both a}} <b>fugue</b> and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the <b>fugue,</b> but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E
5|$|Toccata and <b>Fugue</b> in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach. Live-action {{shots of}} the {{orchestra}} illuminated in blue and gold, backed by superimposed shadows, fade into abstract patterns. Animated lines, shapes and cloud formations reflect the sound and rhythms of the music.|$|E
5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the <b>fugue</b> theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement. Bach based the work on a composition in C minor, as mistakes in the copying process show.|$|E
50|$|Flowers' {{compositions}} include organ <b>fugues</b> and choral <b>fugues.</b> His elaborate first mass, {{of about}} 1860, probably marks {{the date of}} his reception in the church of Rome.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fuguing</b> tunes are sacred music, specifically, Protestant hymns. They {{are written}} for a four-part chorus singing a cappella. George Pullen Jackson has {{described}} the <b>fuguing</b> tune as follows: ...|$|R

5|$|The {{music is}} concertante and virtuoso {{for both the}} trumpet and the soloist. The first aria and the {{concluding}} Alleluja are {{in the style of}} an Italian concerto. Dürr observes that the five movements are in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and <b>fugue.</b> The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the trumpet), and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral <b>fugue,</b> alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Helped by a {{scholarship}} from {{the bishop of}} his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Fauré's tutors were Clément Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and <b>fugue,</b> and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fuguing</b> tune {{arose in}} England {{in the middle}} of the 18th century. The first <b>fuguing</b> tunes were the work of {{itinerant}} singing masters, described by Irving Lowens as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|He {{composed}} {{a cycle of}} twenty-four preludes and <b>fugues</b> in four volumes, for multiple combinations of instruments. In 2004 he performed Books II & III of Preludes and <b>Fugues</b> for 2 pianos with pianist/composer Frederic Rzewski.|$|R
25|$|It {{was in the}} Baroque {{period that}} the writing of <b>fugues</b> became central to composition, in part as a {{demonstration}} of compositional expertise. <b>Fugues</b> were incorporated {{into a variety of}} musical forms. Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Jakob Froberger and Dieterich Buxtehude all wrote <b>fugues,</b> and George Frideric Handel included them in many of his oratorios. Keyboard suites from this time often conclude with a fugal gigue. Domenico Scarlatti has only a few <b>fugues</b> among his corpus of over 500 harpsichord sonatas. The French overture featured a quick fugal section after a slow introduction. The second movement of a sonata da chiesa, as written by Arcangelo Corelli and others, was usually fugal.|$|R
5|$|In 1950 Barenreiter {{published}} Hellmuth Christian Wolff's edition, {{prepared for}} the 1943 Halle revival and reflecting the casting of basses for Otto and Narcissus, even when they sing what would otherwise be the alto part in the last chorus. It presents a German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the da capo arias as well as numerous cuts. The B flat <b>fugue</b> G 37 appears as an act II overture along with other instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of <b>fugue</b> and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they are tied to Hope's idiosyncratic form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E
5|$|The altos and tenors {{are joined}} after seven bars by the <b>fugue</b> {{subject in the}} soprano voice. After a further seven bars the basses sing the last {{statement}} of the subject, accompanied by the full orchestra playing colla parte except for the two alto recorders, bringing the first fugato section to a close. The alto recorders play fragmented quaver figures in unison {{some of which are}} derived from the angular three-note continuo motif, leading into the first seven bar homophonic choral passage.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} 2 <b>fugues.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ariadne musica {{is rarely}} {{performed}} or recorded, although individual preludes and <b>fugues</b> frequently appear on miscellaneous compilations of Baroque organ music. Here's {{a partial list}} of recordings that feature at least one part of Ariadne musica (preludes and <b>fugues</b> or ricercars) in full: ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the post-war}} period, Benjamin Britten set [...] "Green Leaves Are We, Red Rose Our Golden Queen", the opening chorus from his opera Gloriana, op. 53 (1952–53, rev. 1966), in [...] time. Dmitri Shostakovich set <b>Fugues</b> 12, 17, and 19 from his Twenty-Four Preludes and <b>Fugues</b> for piano, op. 87 (1950–51) entirely in [...] time, and also {{interspersed}} this time signature with other meters in Preludes 9, 20, and 24, and in <b>Fugues</b> 15 and 16 {{from the same}} collection.|$|R
5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the beat in the oboes and off the beat in the alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second <b>fugue</b> theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire, Messiaen made {{excellent}} academic progress. In 1924, aged 15, he {{was awarded}} second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon. In 1925 he won first prize in piano accompaniment, and in 1926 he gained first prize in <b>fugue.</b> After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, {{he was awarded}} second prize {{for the history of}} music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing improvisation skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas. Messiaen's mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began. Despite his grief, he resumed his studies, and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and <b>fugue</b> with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
50|$|The opening chorus {{begins with}} as {{instrumental}} sinfonia, presenting the themes. The choir sings two <b>fugues</b> on different themes, but both {{derived from the}} beginning of the sinfonia. The trumpet plays a fifth part in the <b>fugues.</b> The movement concludes with the voices embedded in the sinfonia.|$|R
