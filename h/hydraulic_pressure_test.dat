40|$|The basic {{requirements}} for transport of dangerous gods are that a packaging shall {{be able to}} withstand certain mechanical and chemical stresses, as stated in SRVFS 2006 : 7. The requirements shall guarantee a reasonable level of protection for both humans and environment and is intended to create a system taking into account different types of substances and packaging. Principles for classification, packing requirements, testing procedures shall be simple and clear and guarantee that a minimum level of safety can be achieved without advanced technical equipment and expertise. No requirements concerning test temperatures are given in the regulations but in the standard SS-EN-ISO 16104 : 2003 “Packaging – Transport packaging for dangerous goods – Test Methods” the internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test,</b> for plastics drums, jerricans and composite packaging, shall be performed at a temperature of + 12 °C, otherwise the internal test pressure shall be adjusted with a pressurization factor corresponding to the temperatures used in the test. At temperatures below + 12 +/- 2 °C the test pressure is increased and if the temperature is higher the pressure is lowered. Correction factors exist from + 2 °C to + 20 °C, and for all temperatures above + 20 °C the correction factor {{is the same as}} for + 20 °C. Neither ADR, IMDG-code, ICAO-TI or the UN-recommendations recommend any test temperature. The aim with this project was to perform internal pressure test at different water temperatures. Three jerricans of each type were tested at the following temperatures: + 3, + 20, + 40 and + 55 °C. As {{can be seen in the}} test results the burst pressure decreases substantially with rising temperature. For jerrican A the burst pressure is reduced from 234 kPa at + 3 °C to 175 kPa at + 20 °C, 151 kPa at 40 °C and 114 kPa at + 55 °C. At + 55 °C the burst pressure is reduced to less than half what it was at + 3 °C. Jerrican B is also reduced from 545 kPA at + 3 °C to 226 kPa at + 55 °C while jerrican C is only reduced from 185 kPa to 136 kPa in the same temperature interval. The gradient of the correction factor in table 3 in EN ISO 16104 : 2003 correspond very well with gradient of the tested jerricans in the temperature span between + 2 °C and + 20 °C. All jerricans were made of PE. The pressure/temperature curves show a linear gradient but indicates that the gradient can differ between different materials. Jerrican A and B are produced by the same manufacturer in the same material and show corresponding behaviour, also corresponding to the correction factors in the standard. Jerrican C is produced by another manufacturer and does not show such significant reduction of burst pressure at higher temperatures...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{contemporary}} medical devices {{in the human}} body, such as dilation balloons, closure devices, stents, coils, stent-grafts, etc. are gaining more importance to preclude surgical incisions and general anaesthesia. An analogous procedure for permanent female sterilization is the transcervical approach that does not require either general anaesthesia or surgical incision and uses a normal body passage. However, current methods of transcervical sterilization are unable to provide an instant occlusion of fallopian tubes. This work aims at the design, development and validation of a novel mechanical occlusion device, which achieve both instant and permanent female sterilization via the transcervical approach. The device {{is designed to provide}} an instant mechanical occlusion by deploying, under hysteroscopic visualization an implant into the intramural segment of the fallopian tube. The transcervical sterilization devices comprises of three major systems, an occlusion implant, a guiding system and a delivery actuator. All three systems were designed, developed and validated in this research work. The design of the device has been accomplished through Computer Aided Design (CAD), Finite Element Method (FEM) and experimental testing. Validation of device was performed following a number of successful bench-top in-air deployments and invitro deployments in animal tissue and explanted human uteri.

Thus, despite of their attractive structural performance, mainly {{in terms of}} mechanical strength combined with low weight, the higher cost can be a limitation in many applications. In this scenario, an alternative to reduce the final price of GRP pipes is the addition of quartz sand filler.

40|$|High {{pressure}} is often {{considered to be}} the cause of the high fouling propensity of reverse osmosis (RO) relative to forward osmosis (FO). Several experimental studies have shown that alginate fouling is more susceptible to cleaning in FO than in RO, but the theory that foulant compaction causes this disparity seems to be contradicted by the incompressibility of alginate hydrogels. In addition, the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on fouling in osmotic membrane desalination has never been experimentally isolated, because fixed-flux comparisons at different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures</b> require different draw solution osmotic pressures. In this study, a new approach to isolating the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on alginate fouling and cleaning is introduced: operating FO with elevated but equal feed and draw <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The same concentration of sodium chloride is used as the draw solution in all trials to eliminate possible effects of draw solution osmotic pressure on membrane fouling or cleaning. Theoretical modeling of the effect of alginate foulant compaction on flux reveals that foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline with low salinity feeds but retard flux decline at high salinity. However, in low-salinity alginate fouling trials, for which foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline, the measured flux decline rate was not affected by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, when fouled membranes were cleaned by increasing the feed velocity and reducing the draw osmotic pressure, there was no apparent relationship between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> and cleaning effectiveness. Finally, in situ visualization of foulant removal during the cleaning process revealed no difference in foulant removal mechanisms between different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> These findings demonstrate that alginate gel compaction by high feed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> does not occur and suggest that other explanations should be sought for FO's high fouling resistance relative to RO.
