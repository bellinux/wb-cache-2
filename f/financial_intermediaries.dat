5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

30|$|Social {{theories}} {{for social}} credit {{can be classified}} into traditional and emerging theories that use different research techniques. Traditional theory incorporates various longstanding economic theories into the social credit framework to explore the economic explanations (or functions), creation, and evolution of credit. Some important works include Marx’s credit theory (Marx and Engels 1867), Adam Smith’s credit media theory (Smith 2005), Magruder’s credit creation theory (Magruder 1923), Keynesian’s credit expansion theory (Allen and Gale 2000), and Gurley’s <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> theory (Gurley and Shaw 1955; Gurley and Shaw 1956). Social credit theory is an indispensable component of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> theory, which can be included in traditional theory and modern theory (Chant 2003). Traditional <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> theory includes credit medium theory and credit creation theory. While credit medium theory considers banks to be credit mediums, credit creation theory suggests that banks create credit. The modern <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> theory focuses on credit risk management and argues that credit {{plays an important role}} in the economic system (Scholtens and van Wensveen 2003).|$|R

2500|$|Fractional-reserve banking allows {{banks to}} create credit {{in the form}} of bank deposits, which {{represent}} immediate liquidity to depositors. The banks also provide longer-term loans to borrowers, and act as <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> for those funds. Less liquid forms of deposit (such as time deposits) or riskier classes of financial assets (such as equities or long-term bonds) may lock up a depositor's wealth for a period of time, making it unavailable for use on demand.

2500|$|In verbal negotiations, Feger {{thereafter}} promised [...] "…to {{safeguard the}} Liechtenstein {{character of the}} bank {{both in terms of}} its corporate bodies and the employment of local residents."

They were binding on Guido Feger as a person and dictated that the bank may accept no savings deposits, conduct no foreign currency exchange and not grant loans (including mortgage lending). Thus in the early years, the bank had to concentrate almost entirely on non-domestic activities.

Design/Methodology - The empirical evidence is premised on 11 homogenous panels based on regions (Sub-Saharan and North Africa), income-levels (low, middle, lower-middle and upper-middle), legal-origins (English common-law and French civil-law) and religious dominations (Christianity and Islam). We examine convergence in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size.

40|$|In {{the first}} {{empirical}} {{assessment of the}} incidence of mobile banking on <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development in Africa, we use two definitions of the financial system: the traditional IFS (2008) and Asongu (2011) measures of financial sector importance. When the conception of a financial system is based only on banks and other financial institution (IFS, 2008), mobile banking has a negative incidence on traditional <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> dynamics of depth, activity and size. However, when a previously missing informal-financial sector component is integrated into the definition (Asongu, 2011), mobile-banking has a positive incidence on informal <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development. Three major implications result from the findings. (1) There is a growing role of informal finance in developing countries. (2) The incidence of the burgeoning phenomenon of mobile-banking cannot be effectively assessed at a macroeconomic level by traditional financial development indicators. (3) It is {{a wake-up call for}} scholarly research on informal <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development indicators which will oriented monetary policy; since a great chunk of the monetary base(M 0) in less developed countries is now captured by mobile-banking. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the efficiency changes of U. S. life insurers before and after demutualization in the 1980 s and 1990 s. We use two frontier approaches (the value-added approach and the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> approach) to measure the efficiency changes. In addition, we use Malmquist indices to investigate the efficiency and productivity change of converted life insurers over time. The results using the value-added approach indicate that demutualized life insurers improve their efficiency before demutualization. On the other hand, the evidence using the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> approach shows {{the efficiency of the}} demutualized life insurers relative to mutual control insurers deteriorates before demutualization and improves after conversion. The difference in the results between the two approaches {{is due to the fact}} that the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> approach considers <b>financial</b> conditions. The results of both approaches suggest that there is no efficiency improvement after demutualization relative to stock control insurers.

2500|$|However, {{these claims}} are widely disputed by the {{financial}} industry, who typically regard hedge funds as [...] "small enough to fail", since most are relatively small {{in terms of the}} assets they manage and operate with low leverage, thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail. [...] Formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the 2008 financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and counter-cyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector. Hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis, even while the leverage of other <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> continued to increase. Hedge funds fail regularly, and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis.

2500|$|While {{shareholders}} have {{a privileged}} position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves institutions - mainly asset managers - holding [...] "other people's money" [...] from pension funds, life insurance policies and mutual funds. Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public {{companies on the}} London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights. In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed to be accountable to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested, and case law requires, that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts. Some institutional investors {{have been found to}} work [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management, although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely. Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.|$|E
