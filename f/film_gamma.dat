It is hypothesized that those changes in fractal dimension affect perceptually relevant elements (perceived texture) of the lung, and therefore the fractal dimension {{may prove to be}} a predictor of diagnosis. If the fractal dimensionality reflects structure in ways more accurately reflecting changes in lung structure than can be achieved by nuclear medicine physicians, then it may also prove useful as a diagnostic tool. Fractal dimension is linearly related to the slope of the power spectrum (SPS) as plotted on log-log paper, and the SPS was used as the metric reflecting the fractal dimension. Seventy-two cases were selected that were either normal, had congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pulmonary embolism (PE). Five of the cases had both CHF and COPD. The lung scans from these cases were digitized, with appropriate corrections for linearization, edge artifacts, target nonuniformities and <b>film</b> <b>gamma.</b> Fast Fourier Transforms provided the power spectrum from which the SPS was calculated. Four nuclear medicine physicians read the original lung scans and rated their certainty about the presence of two texture elements, the extensiveness of disease involvement, and presence of the three diseases used (CHF, COPD, and PE). The results found the SPS to be significantly related to both texture ratings and diagnostic certainty, but inferior as a predictor of disease to either texture rating or diagnostic certainty.

In this study, {{the effect of}} a &gamma;-pre-irradiation dose of radiation (radiation absorbed dosages of 10, 20, 30, 40 KGy) under appropriate temperature and grafting conditions was investigated. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed the existence of the graft poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAAm) on the substrate. The optimal value of the dose for grafting was 40 KGy at 50 &deg;C. The scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images clearly showed that increasing the absorbed dose of radiation would increase the amount of grafting. Surface topography and graft thickness in AFM images of the radiated samples showed that the PNIPAAm at the absorbed dose of radiation was properly grafted. The thickness of these grafts was about 50 &ndash; 100 nm.

For ten clinical IMRT plans, the dose delivered to a transverse dose plane was measured with EDR 2 radiographic film. To evaluate the effects of spatial resolution, each irradiated film was digitized using three different resolutions (71, 142, and 285 dpi).

The aim of this study is calculation and comparison of responses of MD- 55 - 2 and HS radiochromic <b>films</b> to <b>gamma</b> rays of 60 Co radioisotope. Methods: The sensitivity of MD- 55 - 2 radiochromic film to 60 Co gamma rays has been calculated and compared with that of HS film. The films were defined as multiple layers and different tallies of MCNPX Monte Carlo code were scored in water and Perspex phantoms. Results: Following simulation of the radiochromic films irradiated by a 60 Co source, it was evident that the sensitivity of a three-layer and a two-layer MD- 55 - 2 film to that of a single-layer film is 2. 95 -fold and 1. 94 -fold higher, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of a HS film is 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 92 times higher compared to a MD- 55 - 2 film, respectively with 3, 2 and 1 layers. Comparing the outputs of F 6, *F 8 and mesh tallies indicate that the F 6 and mesh tallies have the same results but the differences between the results obtained by F 6 and *F 8 tallies are about 5. 8 % for the MD- 55 - 2 film and 10. 5 % for the HS film.

For {{each of the}} 22 lung SBRT cases treated with respiratory-gated VMAT, a dose rate modulated arc therapy (DrMAT) plan was retrospectively generated. A dynamic conformal arc therapy plan with 33 adjoining coplanar arcs was designed and their beam weights were optimized by an inverse planning process. All sub-arc beams were converted {{into a series of}} control points with varying MLC segment and dose rates and merged into an arc beam for a DrMAT plan. The plan quality of original VMAT and DrMAT was compared in terms of target coverage, compactness of dose distribution, and dose sparing of organs at risk. To assess the delivery accuracy, the VMAT and DrMAT plans were delivered to a motion phantom programmed with the corresponding patients' respiratory signal; results were compared using <b>film</b> dosimetry with <b>gamma</b> analysis. The plan quality of DrMAT was equivalent to that of VMAT in terms of target coverage, dose compactness, and dose sparing for the normal lung. In dose sparing for other critical organs, DrMAT was less effective than VMAT for the spinal cord, heart, and esophagus while being well within the limits specified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Delivery accuracy of DrMAT to a moving target was similar to that of VMAT using a gamma criterion of 2 %/ 2 mm but was significantly better using a 2 %/ 1 mm criterion, implying the superiority of DrMAT over VMAT in SBRT for thoracic/abdominal tumors with respiratory movement. We developed a DrMAT technique for SBRT that produces plans of a quality similar to that achieved with VMAT but with better delivery accuracy. This technique is well-suited for small tumors with motion uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} tumour motion during {{radiation}} therapy delivery {{have been widely}} investigated. Motion effects have become increasingly important {{with the introduction of}} dynamic radiotherapy delivery modalities such as enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) where a dynamically collimated radiation beam is delivered to the moving target, resulting in dose blurring and interplay effects which are a consequence of the combined tumor and beam motion. Prior to this work, reported studies on the EDW based interplay effects have been restricted to the use of experimental methods for assessing single-field non-fractionated treatments. In this work, the interplay effects have been investigated for EDW treatments. Single and multiple field treatments have been studied using experimental and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Initially this work experimentally studies interplay effects for single-field non-fractionated EDW treatments, using radiation dosimetry systems placed on a sinusoidaly moving platform. A number of wedge angles (60 º, 45 º and 15 º), field sizes (20 × 20, 10 × 10 and 5 × 5 cm 2), amplitudes (10 - 40 mm in step of 10 mm) and periods (2 s, 3 s, 4. 5 s and 6 s) of tumor motion are analysed (using gamma analysis) for parallel and perpendicular motions (where the tumor and jaw motions are either parallel or perpendicular to each other). For parallel motion it was found that both the amplitude and period of tumor motion affect the interplay, this becomes more prominent where the collimator tumor speeds become identical. For perpendicular motion the amplitude of tumor motion is the dominant factor where as varying the period of tumor motion has no observable effect on the dose distribution. The wedge angle results suggest that the use of a large wedge angle generates greater dose variation for both parallel and perpendicular motions. The use of small field size with a large tumor motion results in the loss of wedged dose distribution for both parallel and perpendicular motion. From these single field measurements a motion amplitude and period have been identified which show the poorest agreement between the target motion and dynamic delivery and these are used as the „worst case motion parameters [...] The experimental work is then extended to multiple-field fractionated treatments. Here a number of pre-existing, multiple–field, wedged lung plans are delivered to the radiation dosimetry systems, employing the worst case motion parameters. Moreover a four field EDW lung plan (using a 4 D CT data set) is delivered to the IMRT quality control phantom with dummy tumor insert over four fractions using the worst case parameters i. e. 40 mm amplitude and 6 s period values.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe general {{problem of}} this work is to {{determine}} the extent to which fine grain emulsions can be employed in aerial photography, with specific application to miniaturization. In such a study, the following factors become important: reduced scale, limited coverage, processing and enlargement technique, loss of speed through the use of finer grained emulsions. In this investigation, laboratory tests were made to study these factors. These tests were to study the relative performance of several systems (lens plus film) and to investigate methods of increasing the speed of fine grain emulsions without seriously affecting the grain size. Finally, flight tests were made to verify the results indicated by the laboratory tests. Miniaturization is defined as the use of 35 mm and 70 mm cameras in aerial photography. It has become important during the last few years because of increasing space limitations inside the aircraft. Besides the obvious saving in weight and space both in the plane and in the processing and storage of the photographs, the miniature camera has other advantages. Because of the short focal length of most miniature camera lenses, it is possible to construct a fast lens of high quality, reducing the exposure time, the time in which vibration and image motion can affect the image, and hence the degree of stabilization which the camera must maintain. On the negative side, the reduced scale necessitates the enlargement of all photographs before they can be used. This increases the relative effects of the grain of the emulsion and uneven development, as well as introducing an additional variable in the photographic process, enlargement. The camera used in this work was an Exacta VX, 35 mm, with an f/ 1. 5 75 mm Biotar lens. This lens was chosen largely because of its wide aperture, but this could not be used under practical conditions because of serious vignetting at f/ 1. 5. The film chosen for a standard of comparison was Aerographic Super XX with a standard development in D- 19 to a gamma of 1. 6 to 1. 7. At the other extreme, with respect to speed and grain size, Microfile was chosen. This film is easily developed to gammas of 3 and 4, but for the purpose {{of this work}}, it was developed in D- 23, diluted 1 : 1, to a gamma similar to Aero XX. As a compromise in speedand grain size, a German film, Perutz Pergrano, was chosen. This film has an ASA exposure index of 12 and medium grain. DevHopment was in D- 19 to a gamma of 1. 35. Because of the inherent low contrast of this <b>film,</b> the <b>gammas</b> of Aero XX and Microfile could not be attained. Extensive tests were run on the f/ 1. 5 75 mm Biotar lens with all three types of film, low and high contrast resolution tar gets, and with and without a yellow filter. From the results of these tests, the area weighted average resolution, or AWAR, was calculated for each aperture-film combination. Then, under the conditions which would be used for the flight tests, the minimum shutter speed was calculated which would prevent the resolution from dropping below the AWAR because of image motion caused by the movement of the airplane with respect to the ground. Next a table was prepared showing the predicted maximum resolution obtained under varying illumination conditions, taking into account the effect on resolution of increasing the aperture or the exposure time. The results of this table, which were confirmed by the flight tests, were: 1) Microfile must be exposed at too wide an aperture to obtain any benefit from its small grain size, 2) Microfile which has been latensified by post-exposure to light (see below) produces the best results under good illumination, but also must be exposed at too wide an aperture under decreased illumination, and 3) Perutz Pergrano produces better results than Aero XX over a range of illumination of 32 : 1. Results of resolution tests on 2 tele-photo lenses were used to compare these lenses with the 75 mm Biotar. The best lens was the f/ 5. 5 180 mm Tele-Xenar lens, which had a performance, in terms of ground detail resolved, equal to the Biotar lens. This result was verified by flight tests with the two lenses, and hence the use of tele-photo lenses is warranted in high altitude photography, where the decreased coverage can be overlooked. From previously unpublished data on four 50 mm lenses and one 58 mm lens, the AWAR was calculated and the results plotted and analyzed. The best of the 50 mm lenses was an f/ 1. 5 Angenieux. When the f/ 2 58 mm Zeiss Biotar lens and the Angenieux lens were reduced to a common level by removing the scale, the two lenses were of approximately the same performance. Of the methods of increasing film speed before exposure (hypersensitization) and after exposure but before development (latensification), the best method tested was post-exposure to a dim light. For this purpose, a darkroom safelight with a yellow filter and reduced applied voltage was exposed to Microfile for 30 minutes at a distance of 18 feet. An increase in speed of 400 % was obtained over its normal speed of 1 (because of underdevelopment). Equal treatment before exposure gave an increase of speed of only 15 %. When the method was used under actual photographic conditions, post-exposure to light gave a somewhat greater increase in speed than 400 %. Resolution tests showed a drop in resolution of 10 %, but the resolving power was still greater than that of Perutz Pergrano. Other methods of hypersensitization and latensification which were tested were NaCl and Borax in solution, Mercury vapor, and combinations of ammonia and alcohol in solution. The maximum increase obtained from these methods was 50 %. The increase in speed obtained on Microfile through post-exposure to light has brought the emulsion sensitivity to a minimum level for best results under normal illumination. Hence the grain size is also approximately at a minimum and this film, used in this way, provides maximum definition in terms of detail resolved. Then on the basis of X 8 enlargements of 35 mm negatives on Microfile which had been latensified in this manner, the conclusion is reached that 35 mm cameras may not be used as an unqualified substitute for aerial cameras. However they may prove valuable in some types of reconnaissance photography. The enlargement to 4 diameters of negatives on Microfile latensified and Perutz Pergrano produces good results. Since this is the amount of enlargement necessary to bring 70 mm negatives to approximately the size of a 9 X 9 inch photograph, 70 mm cameras may be used in connection with these films and others of similar characteristics to replace aerial cameras for many purposes. The major exceptions are in the production of photographs for use in surveying and photogammetric work, which require maximum definition at all levels of magnification. Aero XX is not recommended for use with miniature cameras in general because the lenses of these cameras are capable of higher resolution than this film can accomodate. At a drop in emulsion speled of 8 I from Aero XX, Perutz Pergrano may be used over an illumination range of 32 : 1, and still produce better results than would be obtained with Aero XX. This range might be extended even further through the use of hypersensitization and latensification methods, without seriously affecting the grain size of the emulsion. In conclusion, then, fine grain emulsions (i. e. finer grained than Aero XX) in connection with 70 mm cameras may be used to produce results satisfactory for many purposes in Aerial Photography.
