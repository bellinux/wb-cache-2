50|$|A {{cheese factory}} {{was built in}} Pittston in the late-1800s. By 1885, an {{addition}} {{was added to the}} cheese factory which housed a <b>grain</b> <b>crusher</b> and planing machine, diversifying operations. The cheese factory burned down twice, once in the late-1800s and once in 1900, and was rebuilt after both fires. By 1900, the factory had reached its peak, producing 20 cheeses a day. The cheese was transported to Spencerville where it was then shipped to Montreal to be exported internationally. The factory closed in the 1940s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – “Engineering Innovators without Borders ” {{seeks to}} {{establish}} entrepreneurship {{opportunities for the}} developing world. Through the Junior/Senior engineering clinics at Rowan University, engineering and business majors work together to develop sustainable devices and business plans. The first technology developed by this project is the human powered <b>grain</b> <b>crusher.</b> The <b>grain</b> <b>crusher</b> project aims to create a cheap and simple mechanical device to grind barley, corn, and other grain. The <b>grain</b> <b>crusher</b> utilizes human energy to crush grains quickly and efficiently. The goal is to provide technological solutions to problems {{in the developing world}} by using detailed opportunity recognition evaluations and development of prototypes. The prototypes are then turned over to the developing world for manufacture, distribution, and use. The projects are expected to provide entrepreneurial opportunities for the developing world, alleviate poverty, and improve the quality of life. The <b>grain</b> <b>crusher</b> will be adopted by the DHAN Foundation in India for manufacturing and piloting. Index Terms – clinics, entrepreneurial, prototypes, sustainabl...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrain {{crushing}} {{plays an}} important role in one-dimensional (1 D) compression and creep behaviors of granular materials under high stress. It is clear that the macro-properties of granular materials are closely related to the micro-fracture properties of grains in 1 D compression and creep tests. In this paper, a series of 1 D compression and creep tests were performed on Ottawa sand to investigate the deformation and <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> properties of granular materials, and it shows that the void ratio is correlated to the <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> amount (the quantity of <b>crushed</b> <b>grains)</b> for granular materials subjected to <b>grain</b> <b>crushing.</b> The test results, combining with the existing test data related to <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> of granular materials, were used to verify the relation. Moreover, the implications of these relations on the yield of granular material, and the equivalent effect of stress and time in changing soil fabric are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> of a sand during shear at high confining pressures. The author gives an equation of the increment of energy dissipated per unit volume in <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> in the form; δW_c=pδν_c. Based on a few assumptions, the increment of volumetric strain due to <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> δν_c is determined experimental]y {{as a function of}} effective mean stress p. Hence, the non-recoverable energy change per unit volume δW is divided into two components, namely the energy loss in <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> δW_c and the energy dissipated in the interparticle relative motion (sliding and rolling) δW_s. Thus, the axial strain ε_ and volumetric strain ν_s due solely to the interparticle relative motion are derived from the measured axial strain ε_ 1 and volumetric strain ν, respectively. Obtained values of ε_ and ν_s are utilized for the examination of the phenomenon of <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> during shear, in the light of Rowe's stress-dilatancy theory. This procedure is applied to the results of triaxial tests on a sand under various high confining pressures, up to 500 kg per sq. cm. It is shown that the relation curves between stress ratio (σ'_ 1 /σ'_ 3) and dilatancy factor (1 -δν_s/δε_) tend to move along the K_cυ line...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the stress path and the initial grain size {{distribution}} on <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> was investigated on artificial material of a sand grain size. The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part isotropic compression test, oedometer test, conventional triaxial test (at constant cell pressure) and triaxial compresion test with constant mean effective stress are analysed. For {{the purpose of the}} research described in this part of thesis crushed artificial material known under commercial name Light Expanded Clay Aggregate was used. Based on findings gained from the analysis a model describing <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> and changing of internal friction angle was prepared. In second part of the research different ways of crushing modelling were analysed. Two ways were then briefly tested. For the approach that showed to be better describing <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> a complete model was prepared together with all the measurements needed to track the sample behaviour during simulation. At the end the model was tested. It turned out that the application of parallel bonds in modelling <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> is unnecessary. The main reason for parallel bond application in the model was good description of tensile grain failure. Due to the high coordination numbers the tensile grain splitting is unlikely to occur. Instead, shear grain failure at contact is the most common grain failure. Therefore, contact bonds, which are much more computationally efficient, should be used instead. The sample preparation procedure with application of elementary particle expansion method turned out to be unsuitable. Since for different grain size distributions with the same initial porosity, the stresses induced with this procedure can vary significantly. Compaction of the sample layer by layer would much better serve this task...|$|R

40|$|A new {{formula is}} {{proposed}} for the end-bearing capacity of piles penetrating into crushable soils.

Next, a parametric study is carried out to quantify the effects of <b>grain</b> <b>crushing</b> on the bearing capacity, and then to establish the formula. The predictive capability of the new formula is highlighted against predictions by previous formulae, which highlights its superior origins. C. Zhang, G. D. Nguyen and I. Eina...|$|R
