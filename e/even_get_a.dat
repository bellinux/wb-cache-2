2500|$|Neither team played {{particularly}} {{well in the}} first half. Chicago took the opening kickoff and moved the ball 54 yards, 29 on carries by Walter Payton. [...] But the drive stalled at the 49ers 23 and ended with no points when Bob Thomas missed a 41-yard field goal attempt. [...] San Francisco then drove to the Chicago 2-yard line in 8 plays, but quarterback Joe Montana fumbled the snap on third down and had to dive on the ball. [...] After that, Ray Wersching kicked a 21-yard field goal to make the score 3-0. [...] 49ers safety Dwight Hicks gave the team a great chance to increase their lead more by intercepting a pass from Fuller in Chicago territory. [...] San Francisco {{made it all the}} way to the 2-yard line again, but this time they did not <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> field goal as Montana was intercepted in the end zone by safety Gary Fencik.|$|E
2500|$|According to actor-turned-director Jonathan Morgan, [...] "The {{girls could}} be graded like A, B and C. The A is the chick on the boxcover. She has the power. So she'll show up late {{or not at}} all. 99.9% of them do that." [...] Less {{successful}} actresses {{are more likely to}} perform more extreme acts such as [...] "double-anal". If an actress is willing to perform more extreme acts she will receive more offers of work. Older or less attractive actresses are more likely to perform such acts in order to get work. According to Morgan, [...] "Some girls are used up in nine months or a year. An 18-year-old, sweet young thing, signs with an agency, makes five films in her first week. Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops getting phone calls. Then it's, 'Okay, will you do anal? Will you do gangbangs?' Then they're used up. They can't <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> phone call. The market forces of this industry use them up." ...|$|E

This was true, for it was just as warm here as we have it in June, and we started off to look for a straw-hat store.|$|E

60|$|Not so, however: the Incorruptible, {{about to}} be indicted in this sudden manner, could not be refused a week of delay.

60|$|MR. PRESIDENT, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW HAVEN:--If the Republican {{party of}} this nation shall ever have the {{national}} House entrusted to its keeping, {{it will be the}} duty of that party to attend to all the affairs of national housekeeping. Whatever matters of importance may come up, whatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the Government, that party will then have to attend to. It will then be compelled to attend to other questions, besides this question which now assumes an overwhelming importance--the question of slavery. It is true that in the organization of the Republican party this question of slavery was more important than any other: indeed, so much more important has it become that no more national question can <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hearing just at present. The old question of tariff--a matter that will remain one of the chief affairs of national house-keeping to all time; the question of the management of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the public domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well settled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people? these will remain open and require attention for a great while yet, and these questions will have to be attended to by whatever party has the control of the Government. Yet, just now, they cannot even obtain a hearing, and I do not propose to detain you upon these topics or what sort of hearing they should have when opportunity shall come.|$|E
6000|$|The frigate {{followed}} the cutter, though she passed us outside, even nearer than her consort. I {{got my first}} accurate notion {{of the weight of}} the gale, by seeing this large ship drive past us, under a reefed fore-sail, and a close-reefed main-top-sail, running nearly dead before it. As she came down, she took a sheer, like a vessel scudding in the open ocean; and, at one moment, I feared she would plunge directly into us, though she minded her helm in time to clear everything. A dozen officers on board her were looking at us, from her gangway, her quarter-deck guns, and rigging. All were compelled to hold on with firm grasps; and wonder seemed painted in every countenance. I could see their features for half a minute only, or even a less time; but I could discern this expression in each face. Some looked up at our spars, as if to ascertain whether all were right; while others looked back at the head-land they had just rounded, like those who examined the roadstead. Most shook their heads, as remarks passed from one to the other. The captain, as I took him to be, spoke us. [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] came to me through a trumpet, plainly enough; but answering was out of the question. Before I could <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> trumpet to my mouth, the frigate had gone foaming by, and was already {{beyond the reach of the}} voice. Heads appeared over her taffrail for some time, and we fancied these man-of-war's men regarded us as the instructed are apt to regard the ignorant, whom they fancy to be in danger. Marble sneered a little at the curiosity betrayed by these two crafts; but, as for myself, it caused great uneasiness. I fancied they acted like those who were acquainted with the coast, manifesting surprise at seeing a stranger anchored in the berth we occupied.|$|E
