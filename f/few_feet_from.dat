5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an}} audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E
5|$|Soon after that, {{he entered}} a feud with World Heavyweight Champion Kane. He {{defeated}} Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio to become the number one contender for Kane's World Championship at WWE's Survivor Series PPV event, which ended in a draw. The following week, Edge lost his match with David Otunga thanks to Paul Bearer's interference. He kidnapped Bearer after this and used him to cost Kane his match with Big Show On November 19, Edge tortured Paul Bearer forcing him to play dodge ball and force feeding him, planning to wear down Kane. He then ambushed Kane in the garage {{when he was a}} <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Paul Bearer and drove away with his hostage.|$|E

25|$|The coffin {{was then}} interred {{in the far}} western end of the Nave, only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the entrance, in soil brought {{from each of the}} main battlefields, and covered with a silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of {{thousands}} of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of catharsis for collective mourning on a scale not previously known.|$|E
25|$|Belmont had {{disdain for}} the nouveau riche who, in splashy {{displays}} of wealth, built ostentatious mansions between Bellevue Avenue and the Atlantic coast. As a result, guests entered Belcourt through an entrance on Ledge Road, a short road which runs parallel to Bellevue Avenue. This entrance is a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the curb and the effect was that the back of Belcourt was turned to the nouveau riche on Bellevue Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Roan High Knob is {{the highest}} point on Roan Mountain, rising to 6,285feet (1,916m) between Carver's Gap and Tollhouse Gap. The Tennessee-North Carolina border crosses its summit. High Knob {{is the highest}} point in Tennessee outside of the Great Smoky Mountains, and the 17th-highest peak in the eastern United States. The Appalachian Trail crosses High Knob's western slope, with a well-marked spur trail leading to the summit. The Roan High Knob Shelter is a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the summit.|$|E
25|$|Many older {{students}} {{reacted to the}} event by creating black comedy jokes {{similar to those that}} circulated after the Challenger disaster. A study of the incidence of the jokes showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference. At least one reporter present at Dwyer's suicide suffered from being a witness. Tony Romeo, a radio reporter, was standing a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Dwyer. After the suicide, Romeo developed depression and took a break from journalism.|$|E
25|$|At first, the seven-core cables {{were carried}} inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> {{the side of}} the railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of {{telegraph}} wires against the sky line, {{across the top of the}} viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{turned into}} a disaster. A landing party of 38 seamen and marines from all three vessels, under Lieutenant Spearing, succeeded in {{capturing}} a lower battery with few losses and spiking six guns. An attack on the upper fort failed, with Spearing being killed a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the French ramparts. When the British withdrew to their boats the French captured them. In all, the British lost seven killed and 30 wounded, all the dead {{and most of the}} wounded being from Subtle. The French lost one man wounded.|$|E
25|$|The GAO {{report also}} {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which are just a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building {{is too small to}} accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency has leased space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in multi-tenant buildings. The FBI admitted its internal security forces are not stationed at these leased spaces, but merely patrol them periodically.|$|E
25|$|Upon examination, the {{military}} surgeons determined that no one's neck {{had been broken}} by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written {{on a piece of}} paper by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, just a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the gallows. A white picket fence marked the burial site. The night that she died, a mob attacked the Surratt boarding house and began stripping it of souvenirs until the police stopped them.|$|E

25|$|Having secretively flown {{virtually}} the entire width of Vietnam, the copter dropped in on its target. The two Lao commandos dropped the last <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the aircraft. The helicopter then flew off to a pre-selected tree on a 340-meter peak and dropped a mesh web supporting a camouflaged solar-powered communications relay over its crown. From there, the Hughes 500P moved again and settled into a dry streambed for a 20-minute wait while the commandos set up the wiretap. The hidey-hole turned near disastrous. A rock knifed the FLIR's liquid nitrogen tank; the resulting leak disabled the FLIR. At the same time, a radar detector began sounding its alarm. The pilot turned off the warning and settled in to wait for 20 minutes while the commandos worked. The enemy MiGs did not show up.|$|E
25|$|By both {{temperament}} and connections, Adler {{had been the}} one who brought in new business to the partnership, and following the rupture Sullivan received few large commissions after the Carson Pirie Scott Department Store. He went into a twenty-year-long financial and emotional decline, beset by a shortage of commissions, chronic financial problems, and alcoholism. He obtained a few commissions for small-town Midwestern banks (see below), wrote books, and in 1922 appeared as a critic of Raymond Hood's winning entry for the Tribune Tower competition. He died in a Chicago hotel room on April 14, 1924. He left a wife, Mary Azona Hattabaugh, from whom he was separated. A modest headstone marks his final resting spot in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago's Uptown and Lake View neighborhood. Later, a monument was erected in Sullivan's honor, a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> his headstone.|$|E
25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E

25|$|Woods {{made his}} next {{appearance}} at the Dubai Desert Classic, an event he had previously won twice and always ended inside the top five, in six previous appearances. Woods, ranked #3 in the world, was grouped with #1 Lee Westwood and #2 Martin Kaymer {{for the first two}} rounds. Woods started with 71 and scored 6-under 66 in round two to move into contention, and stayed in the hunt with 72 for round three, but struggled on Sunday with 75, to end in a tie for 20th, at 4-under 284, seven shots back of winner Álvaro Quirós. During the final round of that competition, Woods spat on the ground a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the hole, after missing a putt at the 12th green. The incident was shown on televised coverage worldwide. Woods apologized for the incident in which he breached the European Tour's code of conduct; he will be fined an undisclosed sum. Later starters had to play across the area where Woods spat. Sportswriter John Feinstein stated on Golf Channel {{a few days after the}} incident that Woods is in fact the most-fined player in the history of the PGA Tour.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the ground.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ida use {{the lift}} cable {{to explore the}} pit, {{although}} the Doctor finds nothing but darkness far below. He then chooses to detach himself and fall, landing at the bottom thanks to an air cushion and finds that he can breathe. Finding cave paintings depicting the Beast's final battle and imprisonment, the Doctor discovers two jars on pedestals a <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> each other as their light reveals the physical form of the Beast. The Doctor quickly deduces from the unintelligible grunts coming from the Beast that its consciousness has already escaped and that Krop Tor was designed as the perfect prison for the Beast: its jailers devised the jars as a failsafe, since their destruction would cause the planet to plunge into the black hole with {{the body of the}} Beast destroyed, and the mind killed in the process. Although the Doctor realises he must also sacrifice Rose and the others to destroy the Beast, he smashes the jars anyway on faith in his companion. As the planet falls out of orbit, the Doctor accepts his fate by mocking the Beast, before stumbling across his TARDIS while fleeing the collapsing cave.|$|E
