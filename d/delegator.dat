40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to obtain an {{in-depth}} understanding of what the final phase of life was like for a group of gravely ill and dying cancer patients, with focus on autonomy, dependency and quality of life. The specific aims were to: 1) describe the patients' autonomy and how the attitudes of relatives and staff promoted/hindered patient participation in decision-making, 2) describe how the patients assessed their quality of life in two care cultures, 3) describe how members of the care team prognosticated the patients' remaining survival time, and 4) investigate continuity of care site in two different care cultures during the patients' final month of life. The theoretical framework consisted of Weisman's concept of an appropriate death, and an ethical perspective based on a dialogical ethic and truthfulness. The study comprised 56 consecutively selected adult cancer patients. Data was collected via retrospective interviews with relatives, quality of life assessments by the patients, prognoses/motivations from members in the care team, and register data on the utilisation of forms of care. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Four categories respecting autonomy were found; the dying patients exercised their autonomy as self-determiners, co-determiners, <b>delegators</b> and nonparticipators. The co-determiners and <b>delegators</b> practised "shared autonomy" in interaction with relatives and staff, and a dialogue characterised by truthfulness was typical of the interplay. In the assessment of quality of life, half of the patients assessed themselves as satisfied/somewhat satisfied with their situation. The "cognitive-" and "emotional functioning" differed least from that of a normal population, while "physical-", "role functioning" and "global health status/quality of life" differed most. The prognosticated and the actual remaining survival time were in agreement for 19 / 51 patients (± 0. 5 months). Some resistance to prognosticating emerged. The members of the care team used different forms of knowledge to motivate their prognostication. Continuity in terms of care site was fairly high for the majority of dying patients. To a great extent, organisational and structural factors determined the choice of care form...|$|R

40|$|The Swiss Financial Services (FS) {{industry}} has seen major changes characterized by regulatory and growth issues, increased competition, {{development of new}} delivery channels commoditizing bank products, customer preferences, and technological advances. These have impacted revenue, profits, shareholder, and market value generation. Therefore, financial institutions need to transform their business models making them customer-centric. They must understand critical customer value drivers in accordance with customer profitability indicators. Given the highly competitive environment relationship marketing (RM) strategies aim to build loyal long-term relationships. Active customers are suggested to be highly-involved, confident and more profitable. For this research, {{depending on the type}} of relationship with their FS provider, three distinct customer groups namely self-directors, semi-self-directors, and <b>delegators</b> were identified and investigated. This study investigates the following research questions: 1. How can highly-involved and confident FS customers be characterized? 2. How do highly-involved and confident customer groups differ in terms of relationship value dimensions? 3. How do highly-involved and confident customer groups differ in terms of bonding value dimensions? 4. Which relationship dimensions drive behavioural loyalty among highly-involved and confident customers? Based on the literature review seven relationship value dimensions namely involvement, confidence, self-advocacy, service quality, satisfaction, trust, and loyalty were identified. Seven bonding value dimensions were derived, namely financial value, technical value, functional value, social value, temporal value, spatial value, and product value. A theoretical loyalty model comprising previously identified relationship value dimensions was developed. An online survey applying respondent driven sampling (RDS) technique was administered over 130 valid respondents. Descriptive analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), value opportunity algorithm analysis, discriminant analysis, and structure equation modelling (SEM) technique were applied using statistical software analysis package SPSS 17 and AMOS. The results suggest that customer groups differ in terms of socio-demographic and financial behavioural characteristics. With respect to relationship value dimensions loyalty is influenced by trust, satisfaction, and service quality. The results also indicate that involvement, confidence and self-advocacy are potentially different among customer groups. Self-directed FS customers are more involved, more confident and thus more self-advocate compared to semi-self-directors and <b>delegators.</b> True and loyal relationship was found to coexist for all customer groups investigated. With respect to value bonding dimensions customer groups differ in the way they perceive spatial values and product values vis-a-vis importance and to some extent fulfilment. For all customer groups technical and temporal values were similarly decisive. While spatial values were regarded to be over served by all customer groups social and functional values showed to some extent improvement opportunities for <b>delegators,</b> product values showed improvement opportunities for semi-self-directors. This study has provided insights on how customers can be better managed enabling efficient and effective bonding strategies that imply RM as well strategic management considerations. It has provided the first empirical and systematically conducted investigation of highly-involved and confident FS customers with respect to descriptive, relationship value and bonding value dimension considerations. Finally, the managerial and research implications and guidelines for strategic management and RM practice are discussed including directions for a potential business model targeting in particular the customer segments investigated...|$|R

5000|$|Delegated {{jurisdiction}} rests {{either on}} a special authorization of the holders of ordinary jurisdiction (delegatio ab homine), or on a general law (delegatio a lege, a jure, a canone). Thus, the Council of Trent transferred a number of papal rights to the bishops [...] "tanquam Apostolicae Sedis delegati", i.e. also as delegates of the Apostolic See, and [...] "etiam tanquam Apostolicae Sedis delegati", i.e. also as delegates of the Apostolic See. In the first class of cases, bishops do not possess oridary jurisdiction. The meaning of the second expression is disputed, but it is generally taken as purely cumulative. If the delegation applies to one or several designated cases only, it is special delegation; if it applies to an entire class of subjects, it is then general delegation or delegation for the universality of causes. Delegated jurisdiction for the total {{of a number of}} matters is known as delegatio mandata. Only those can be appointed delegates who are competent to execute the delegation. For an act of consecration the delegate must have himself the necessary sacred orders. For acts of jurisdiction he must be an ecclesiastic, though the pope could also delegate a layman. Papal delegation is usually conferred only on ecclesiastical dignitaries or canons. The delegate must be twenty years old, but eighteen years suffices for one appointed by the pope. He must also be free from excommunication. Those placed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} <b>delegator</b> must submit to the delegation. Delegation for one matter can also be conferred upon several. The distinction to be made is whether they have to act jointly and severally (collegiately), jointly but individually (solidarily), or solidarily at least in some given case. The delegate is to follow exactly his instructions, but is empowered to do all that is necessary to execute them. If he exceed his power, his act is null. When necessary the delegate can himself delegate, i.e. subdelegate, a qualified person; he can do this especially if he is a papal delegate, or if he has received permission, or if he has been delegated for a number of cases. Since delegation constitutes a new court, appeal can be taken from the delegate to the <b>delegator,</b> and in the case of subdelegation to the original <b>delegator.</b> Delegated jurisdiction expires on the death of the delegate, in case the commission were not issued in view of the permanence of his office, on the loss of office or the death of the <b>delegator,</b> in case the delegate has not acted (re adhuc integra, the matter being still intact), on recall of his authority by the <b>delegator</b> (even re adhuc nondum integra, the matter being no longer intact), on expiration of the allotted time, on settlement of the matter, on declaration of the delegate that he has no power.|$|E

40|$|Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is {{a highly}} useful {{cryptographic}} primitive whereby Alice and Bob can endow a proxy with the capacity to change ciphertext recipients from Alice to Bob, without the proxy itself being able to decrypt, thereby providing delegation of decryption authority. Key-private PRE (KP-PRE) specifies an additional level of confidentiality, requiring pseudo-random proxy keys that leak no information on {{the identity of the}} <b>delegators</b> and delegatees. In this paper, we propose a CPA-secure PK-PRE scheme in the standard model (which we then transform into a CCA-secure scheme in the random oracle model). Both schemes enjoy highly desirable properties such as uni-directionality and multi-hop delegation. Unlike (the few) prior constructions of PRE and KP-PRE that typically rely on bilinear maps under ad hoc assumptions, security of our construction is based on the hardness of the standard Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem, itself reducible from worst-case lattice hard problems that are conjectured immune to quantum cryptanalysis, or “post-quantum”. Of independent interest, we further examine the practical hardness of the LWE assumption, using Kannan’s exhaustive search algorithm coupling with pruning techniques. This leads to state-of-the-art parameters not only for our scheme, but also for a number of other primitives based on LWE published the literature. ...|$|R

As multipartite {{access structures}} can well mirror the real social organizations, {{of which the}} participants are partitioned into disjoint groups according to their properties, it is desirable to find expressive ideal multipartite access structures. Integer polymatroids, due to their close relationship with ideal multipartite access structures, have been shown as a powerful tool to study the ideality of some multipartite access structures. In this paper, to cater for flexible applications, we consider several ideal multipartite access structures that further extend some known results. We first explore a type of compartmented access structures with strictly lower bounds, which provide fairness among all the participant groups when recovering the secret. Then, we investigate ideal bench access structures where the participant set {{is divided into two}} parts, that is, line-up section and bench section.

5000|$|A major {{scholarly}} {{attack on}} the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist Robert Michels who developed the mainstream political science theory of the iron law of oligarchy in 1911. Michels argued that oligarchy is inevitable as an [...] "iron law" [...] within any organization as part of the [...] "tactical and technical necessities" [...] of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: [...] "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the <b>delegators.</b> Who says organization, says oligarchy" [...] and went on to state [...] "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy." [...] Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a façade legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable. Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, Eduoard Berth, Arturo Labriola, and Enrico Leone and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of social democracy and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.

40|$|Classifying {{patients}} as "active" or "passive" {{with regard to}} healthcare decision making is misleading, since patients have different desires for different components of the decision-making process. Distinguishing patients' desired roles is an essential step towards promoting care that respects and responds to individual patients' preferences. We included items on the 2004 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study mail survey measuring preferences for four components of the decision-making process: physician knowledge of patient medical history, physician disclosure of treatment choices, discussion of treatment choices, and selection of treatment choice. We characterized preference types for 5199 older adults using cluster analysis. Ninety-six percent of respondents are represented by four preference types, all of which prefer maximal information exchange with physicians. Fifty-seven percent of respondents wanted to retain personal control over important medical decisions ("autonomists"). Among the autonomists, 81 % preferred to discuss treatment choices with their physician. Thirty-nine percent of respondents wanted their physician to make important medical decisions ("delegators").
