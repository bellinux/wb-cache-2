25|$|<b>Detasseling</b> corn is {{removing}} the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from {{the tops of}} corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It {{is a form of}} pollination control, employed to cross-breed, or hybridize, two varieties of corn.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to employing a large teenage workforce, {{some areas of}} the country employ migrant workers as detasselers. Migrant workers wages are usually paid on a piece rates basis. During the 1980s in {{some areas of the}} U.S. <b>detasseling</b> work shifted from being primarily local teenagers to primarily migrant farm workers.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{field of}} seed corn is {{initially}} detasseled by machines, eventually people are employed to <b>detassel</b> the plants that the machines missed and to remove any tassels that the machines left in the leaves of other corn plants. This is done either by having [...] "detasselers" [...] walk through the corn field removing the tassels or by having detasselers ride through the corn field on a detasseler carrier. Detasseler carriers are typically employed when the corn is too tall to be detasseled from ground level. Each carrier can hold from eight to twelve detasselers.|$|R
40|$|Donald N. Duvick’s forty-year {{professional}} career {{was dedicated to}} the development of superior seeds for agricultural distribution. His major research interests were in the development and production of hybrid corn, but he also had responsibilities for other crop species sold commercially throughout the United States and the world. Duvick started his career in 1951 at Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Company as a corn breeder, studying the genetics of cytoplasmic pollen sterility. He advanced within the company to become senior vice president of research in 1984, a position he held until his retirement in 1990. In order to produce large quantities of high-quality hybrid seed corn for growers each year, vast numbers of people were required to <b>detassel</b> cornfields by hand. Production of hybrid seed corn is seasonal (three to five weeks), so it was difficult to hire an adequate number of detasselers and supervisors to ensure quality control in the yearly production. Hence, it was of interest to develop and identify genetic systems that could reduce the need for these seasonal workers by controlling the inherent fertility of the plants.

40|$|Children {{working in}} {{agriculture}} {{have always been}} a part of the rural culture and work ethos of the United States, especially on the Great Plains. Many teenagers still <b>detassel</b> corn or walk the beans in the summer months to earn spending money or money for college. But what about the children who work as migrant laborers in commercialized agriculture? These children, even today, typically go untracked by governmental agencies. The children may lag behind in school because of their family 2 ̆ 7 s migrations and their frequent absences from school to work in the crops. Unlike the child who works during the summer to earn supplemental income, the migrant family 2 ̆ 7 s wage is often tied to the labor of the child worker. While the majority of commercially grown crops today are worked by migrants on the coasts, the use of child labor in commercialized agriculture in the Great Plains has a long and checkered history. A history of child labor in the early sugar beet industry in the Great Plains traces two different trends that intersect in the period between 1890 and 1920. The first trend was the movement of sugar beet production away from small family farms to large commercial farms in the North Platte Valley of Nebraska and the South Platte Valley of Colorado in the 1890 s. The Great Western Sugar Company and the American Sugar Company, among others, owned the land and recruited the labor to work the beets. The second trend was the arrival of German-Russian families in the 1890 s, and later the arrival of Mexican workers in the Midwest, especially after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Both groups with their large families played leading roles in the cultivation of this important American crop. Sugar companies hired heads of families knowing that children would also be employed in the fields in order for the families to earn a living wage. In 1905 the private New Yorkbased National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) began looking at child labor in berry picking, and by 1911 had expanded their investigations questioning whether the work of child beet workers was simply family farm chores or actually a form of industrialized agricultural child labor. The investigations of the NCLC, which often included photographs by Lewis Hine, became a part of a decadeslong effort to include agricultural workers in child labor reforms. The legislative highlight of this reform effort was passage during the New Deal of a federal child labor law called the Jones-Costigan Act of 1934. JonesCostigan and the subsequent Sugar Act of 1937 restricted subsidies to farmers who used children in cultivating sugar beets. This legislation did more to protect children in the sugar beet industry than did efforts to unionize agricultural workers in the 1930 s or the mechanization of sugar beet growing during World War II. There was no labor organization among sugar beet workers in the period between 1890 and 1920. Labor organization among agricultural workers has an irregular history, with efforts to organize on the Great Plains even more sporadic than those on the coasts. Before World War I the radical labor union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempted to organize bindlestiffs, mostly wheat harvesters, in the Midwest and Western states through their Agricultural Workers Organization. Bindlestiffs were adult male harvest hands who carried all their goods in a bundle, or bindle. On the East Coast, the IWW looked into conditions of migrant workers on the truck and tobacco farms through its Agricultural Workers 2 ̆ 7 Industrial Union. Because of the crackdown on radical organizations after the war, most of the IWW 2 ̆ 7 s successes involving migrant workers were short-lived at best, and none specifically involved sugar beet workers...|$|R
25|$|The manner {{by which}} wages are {{determined}} can also vary greatly between <b>detasseling</b> contractors.

50|$|But in 1970, the Southern corn leaf blight {{epidemic}} (Helminthosporium maydis Nisik. and Miyake) {{swept the}} U.S. corn belt. At the same time, at least 80% of the maize being {{grown in the}} U.S. was susceptible to the blight because this maize contained the “Texas type” male-sterile cytoplasm, which allowed production of hybrid seed without mechanical or hand <b>detasseling.</b> As a result, there was a scramble in 1971 to find any kind of maize that had normal cytoplasm - cytoplasm that would resist the blight.

50|$|Corn {{heterosis}} was famously {{demonstrated in}} the early 20th century by George H. Shull and Edward M. East after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. William James Beal of Michigan State University based on work begun in 1879 {{at the urging of}} Charles Darwin. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a field experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene Davenport and Perry Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald F. Jones at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914-1917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The process of creating these hybrids often involves <b>detasseling.</b>|$|E
