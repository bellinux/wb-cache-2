5|$|Hull Creek begins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> in Scott Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for more}} than a mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southeast, flowing through a water gap alongside Pennsylvania Route 247 and entering Blakely. After several tenths of a mile, the creek crosses a highway and flows south-southwest in a much smaller valley. After some distance, it enters Dickson City and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond,</b> as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E

5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond,</b> Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese House {{is known}} to date from 1738 making it the first known {{building}} in England built in the Chinese style. It is made of wood and painted on canvas inside and out by Francesco Sleter. Originally it was on stilts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> near the Elysian Fields. In 1750 it was moved from Stowe and was purchased by the National Trust in 1996 and returned and placed in its present position.

25|$|Goldfish {{are popular}} pond fish, {{since they are}} small, inexpensive, {{colourful}} and very hardy. In an outdoor pond or water garden, they may even survive for brief periods if ice forms on the surface, {{as long as there}} is enough oxygen remaining in the water and the pond does not freeze solid. Common goldfish, London and Bristol shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet and some hardier fantail goldfish can be kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> all year round in temperate and subtropical climates. Moor, veiltail, oranda and lionhead can be kept safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Cranberry Creek begins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> in Hazle Township. It flows {{north for}} a few tenths of a mile, passing through the Grape Run Reservoir. The creek exits the {{reservoir}} on its eastern side and continues flowing north. After approximately a mile, it turns east-northeast for several tenths of a mile. It then turns north and then northwest, passing between the communities of Cranberry and Hollars Hill. Then the creek turns west and crosses Pennsylvania Route 924. It continues west for some distance before turning north and passing between two mountains, flowing parallel to Interstate 81. Some distance later, it receives an unnamed tributary and reaches its confluence with Stony Creek.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} of the {{peninsula}} the princess is known as Chil Kongju (the Seventh Princess), seventh of the daughters of the king.

Names in other provinces include Pali Kongju and Kongsim.

25|$|Vincent Preissnitz {{was the son}} of {{a peasant}} farmer who, as a young child, {{observed}} a wounded deer bathing a wound <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> near his home. Over the course of several days, he would see this deer return and eventually the wound was healed. Later as a teenager, Preissnitz was attending to a horse cart, when the cart ran him over, breaking three of his ribs. A physician told him that they would never heal. Preissnitz decided to try his own hand at healing himself, and wrapped his wounds with damp bandages. By daily changing his bandages and drinking large quantities of water, after about a year, his broken ribs had been cured. Preissnitz quickly gained fame in his hometown and became the consulted physician.|$|E

25|$|The {{two factors}} that are {{required}} for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of germs that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in {{the integrity of the}} skin of the ear canal that allow an infection to occur. If the skin is healthy and uninjured, only exposure to a high concentration of pathogens, such as submersion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> contaminated by sewage, is likely to set off an episode. However, if there are chronic skin conditions that affect the ear canal skin, such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis or abnormalities of keratin production, or if there has been a break in the skin from trauma, even the normal bacteria found in the ear canal may cause infection and full-blown symptoms of external otitis.|$|E
25|$|An episode {{from the}} life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the {{garments}} of gopis when they were bathing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> near Vrindavan. Varuna, the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they were taking a bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted that they come out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{was anxious}} about the divine work, {{including}} the King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the King who was anxious to see the deity, could not control his eagerness, and he visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough Vishwakarma was very upset and he left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma to help him. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images, and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (soul) to the image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> near the temple.|$|E
