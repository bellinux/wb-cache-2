Eichmann held a series of low-paying jobs until finding employment at Mercedes-Benz, where he rose to <b>department</b> <b>head.</b> The family built a house at 14 Garibaldi Street (now 6061 Garibaldi Street) and moved in during 1960.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Colonel Maritza Sáenz Ryan, who {{had participated}} in both Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, became the first woman and first Hispanic West Point {{graduate}} to serve as an academic <b>department</b> <b>head.</b> She also has the distinction of being the most senior ranking Hispanic Judge Advocate and has been instrumental in raising awareness of the inequity and impracticality of the Combat Exclusion Policy, which restricts women's roles and opportunities in the military regardless of talent or ability.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other <b>department</b> <b>head</b> as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an interim mayor.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the leadership roles of secondary schools <b>department</b> <b>heads</b> at two government schools in Belize. Seven participants {{participated in the study}} and data regarding their perceptions of their leadership roles were collected through open-ended semi-structured interviews. Relevant sections from Belizean education documents were purposefully selected based on their relevance to the study. Documents were used to enrich the interview data. Three data analysis strategies—content analysis (Patton, 2002), inductive analysis (Hatch, 2002), and educational criticism (Eisner, 1998) —were used in the study. Discussion of the analysis was based on the following three themes: (a) build instructional capacity, (b) increase learning opportunities for students, and (c) provide technical and vocational teachers access to professional training and development in technical and vocational education. The themes are perspectives from which to view and understand the leadership roles of secondary school <b>department</b> <b>heads</b> at two government schools in Belize. Three major conclusions resulted from this study. One, secondary school <b>department</b> <b>heads</b> at the two government schools in Belize are school leaders whose multifaceted role includes myriad duties, responsibilities, and obligations. Two, <b>department</b> <b>heads</b> are street-level bureaucrats who implement and enforce policies and regulations through their classroom routines and the decisions they make. Three, policymakers, school management, and <b>department</b> <b>heads</b> need to invest in sustained professional training and development activities that are specifically designed for <b>department</b> <b>heads.</b> Implications for policy and practice include the need to establish minimum professional selection criteria for the role of <b>department</b> <b>heads,</b> expand the capacity of teacher training institutions, and foster a culture that supports and nurtures shared instructional leadership and learning among <b>department</b> <b>heads...</b>|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water <b>department</b> <b>head</b> took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO <b>department</b> <b>head</b> Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{design was}} {{approved}} on 30 September 1912, though {{the heads of}} the General Navy Department—Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Günther von Krosigk and Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Reinhard Scheer—and the Weapons <b>Department</b> <b>head,</b> Vizeadmiral Gerhard Gerdes, had to submit any revisions they deemed were necessary. The design staff suggested using triple or even quadruple gun turrets to keep the displacement under the 30,000-ton limit. Another suggested alternative was to use six 38cm (15in) guns in twin turrets, one forward and two aft; Wilhelm II accepted that design on 2 May 1913, though Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the {{commander in chief of the}} High Seas Fleet, preferred the 30.5cm gun of the Derfflinger-class ships. As a compromise, the new battlecruisers were to be armed with eight 35cm (13.8inch) guns.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, {{training}} {{as both a}} nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with <b>department</b> <b>head</b> Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, {{it was at the}} latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers– {{the first time that a}} woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.|$|E

5|$|The 1949 {{detonation}} of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted {{an all-out}} {{effort by the}} United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler's <b>department</b> <b>head</b> at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to re-establish careers interrupted by the war and were reluctant to face more disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield, {{but there was also}} now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler agreed to go to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of his graduate students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.|$|E

He is also favorable towards Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who {{he believes is}} the head of the customer service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. Kelly is initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees to be a more dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join the inner circle, while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of the inner circle is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to have no business experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the <b>department</b> <b>head</b> rather than figuring out the truth.|$|E
