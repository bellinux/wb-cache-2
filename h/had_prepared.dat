He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and <b>had</b> <b>prepared</b> an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Latrun {{comprised}} a detention {{camp and}} a fortified police station {{occupied by the}} British, a Trappist monastery, and several Arab villages: Latrun, Imwas, Dayr Ayyub and Bayt Nuba.

5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and <b>had</b> <b>prepared</b> his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez <b>had</b> <b>prepared</b> by {{seizing the}} galley of the West India Company {{anchored}} on the river, {{so that no}} Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape.

5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 <b>had</b> <b>prepared</b> to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E

Zwingli summarised his position in the Schlussreden (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles). Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli <b>had</b> <b>prepared</b> for, was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, and simply insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli {{would be allowed to}} continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.|$|E
