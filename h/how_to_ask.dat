Despite knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions. Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E

50|$|Often {{there is}} more than one bridesmaid: in modern times the bride chooses <b>how</b> many <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> Historically, no person of status went out unattended, and the size of the retinue was closely {{calculated}} to be appropriate to the family's social status. A large group of bridesmaids provided an opportunity for showing off the family's social status and wealth.

60|$|Old words {{which he}} learnt at his mother's knee {{come back to}} him--old words that he almost forgot, perhaps, in the {{strength}} and gaiety of his youth and prosperity. And he prays. He prays clumsily enough, perhaps. He is not accustomed to praying; and he hardly knows what to ask for, or <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for it. Be it so. In {{that he is not}} so very much worse off than others. What did St. Paul say, even of himself? 'We know not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for anything as we ought: but the Spirit maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered'--too deep for words. Yes, in every honest heart there are longings too deep for words. A man knows he wants something: but knows not what he wants. He cannot find the right words to say to God. Let him take comfort. What he does not know, the Holy Spirit of Whitsuntide--the Spirit of Jesus Christ--does know. Christ knows what we want, and offers our clumsy prayers up to our heavenly Father, not in the shape in which we put them, but as they ought to be, as we should like them to be; and our Father hears them.|$|E

60|$|He {{had called}} them both Emily and Nora when Sir Marmaduke and Lady Rowley were with {{them before the}} marriage, and, taking the liberty of a very old family friend, had {{continued}} the practice. Mrs. Trevelyan was quite aware {{that she had been}} so called by him in the presence of her husband,--and that her husband had not objected. But that was now some months ago, before baby was born; and she was aware also that he had not called her so latterly in presence of her husband. She thoroughly wished that she knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him not to do so again; but the matter was very difficult, as she could not make such a request without betraying some fear on her husband's part. The subject which they were now discussing was too important to her to allow her to dwell upon this trouble at the moment, and so she permitted him to go on with his speech.|$|E
6000|$|The motherly, but coarse {{kindness}} of Dame Glendinning, and the doating fondness {{of her old}} domestic, seemed now the only kind feeling of which she formed the object; {{and she could not}} but reflect how little these were to be compared with the devoted attachment of a high-souled youth, whom the least glance of her eye could command, as the high-mettled steed is governed by the bridle of the rider. It was when plunged among these desolating reflections, that Mary Avenel felt the void of mind, arising from the narrow and bigoted ignorance in which Rome then educated the children of her church. Their whole religion was a ritual, and their prayers were the formal iteration of unknown words, which, in the hour of affliction, could yield but little consolation to those who from habit resorted to them. Unused to the practice of mental devotion, and of personal approach to the Divine Presence by prayer, she could not help exclaiming in her distress, [...] "There is no aid for me on earth, and I know not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> it from Heaven!" ...|$|E
