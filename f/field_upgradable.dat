5000|$|In May 2015, the DASH7 Alliance {{publicly}} {{released the}} v1.0 of the DASH7 Alliance Protocol. This step brought a clear path for interoperability between products and high layer file management, {{as well as}} InSitu firmware upgrade. The Dash7 products have full management features, encryption and constraints to be <b>field</b> <b>upgradable</b> ( [...] long term maintenance addressed [...] ) ...|$|E
50|$|Some PC radios {{have the}} great {{advantage}} of being <b>field</b> <b>upgradable</b> by the owner. New versions of the DSP firmware can be downloaded from the manufacturer's web site and uploaded into the flash memory of the radio. The manufacturer can then in effect add new features to the radio over time, such as adding new filters, DSP noise reduction, or simply to correct bugs.|$|E
40|$|Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR) {{concepts}} {{have recently}} drawn considerable interest. These radio concepts built on {{digital signal processing}} to realize flexibly programmable radio transceivers, which can adapt in a smart way to their environment. As CMOS is the mainstream IC technology for digital, we {{would also like to}} realize SDR and CR radio transceivers in CMOS. Attempts are being made to integrate the functionality of multiple dedicated narrowband radios into one radio chip, which is reconfigurable by software [1, 2]. This is hoped to bring cost and size reductions while supporting an ever increasing set of communication standards in a single device. The SDR concept might also allow <b>field</b> <b>upgradable</b> radios to accommodate evolving standards or cognitive radios to improve the efficiency of spectrum use [3]...|$|E
