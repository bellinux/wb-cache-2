40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} OECD countries are characterised {{by a high}} degree of stability of their export specialisation patterns at the country level or not. Furthermore, we test whether the countries have become more or less specialised. In this context we distinguish between specialisation (or <b>de-specialisation)</b> in trade patterns on the one hand, and divergence (or, on the contrary, convergence) on the other. A specialisation process refers to a process in which specialisation intra-country becomes more dispersed (and counter-wise for <b>de-specialisation).</b> In contrast, a divergence process refers to a process in which countries become more different in terms of specialisation in a particular sector, across countries (and counter-wise for convergence). We examine the sensitivity for the level of aggregation, and we apply a period of nearly three decades from 1965 to 1992. Twenty OECD countries are considered. The intra-country results show that the national specialisation patterns are rather sticky, although there is a tendency for countries to de-specialise in the medium to long term. The sector-wise results display convergence both in terms of β-and σ-convergence. In conclusion, we discuss the results (<b>de-specialisation</b> in particular) in the context of economic integration, and furthermore we contrast the findings with similar exercises conducted on structural change in technological specialisation. ...|$|E
40|$|Using a long-run {{series of}} I-O tables, some simple facts are {{explored}} {{with respect to}} the Italian trade balance in the period 1960 - 2000. The analysis confirms that the Italian economy underwent a <b>de-specialisation</b> process before the Euro era. This phenomenon weakened our export capacity, and in addition worsened significantly our dependence on non-oil imports. ...|$|E
40|$|In France, "Pôle Emploi" is {{the central}} {{operator}} for services aimed at job applicants. It applies career guidance which in practice results in a review on employability and making a selection among the unemployed for an appropriate plan of action. Professionals lose out in terms of specialisation; they intervene within this framework to coach the unemployed and mobilise rather vague skills. Moreover, this <b>de-specialisation</b> is coupled up {{with a sort of}} standardisation and bureaucratic multi-tasking of job functions and positions. Consultants find themselves {{at the heart of a}} contradiction inherent to job guidance such as it is practised, which consists in associating thinking about vocational plans with a quick return to employment...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the development of regional specialisation and geographical concentration in Germany between 1993 and 2001. Somewhat contrary to theoretical expectations derived from the recent literature in location theory, we neither find compelling evidence for a specialisation process of German regions, nor for a concentration process of industries. By and large and with some exceptions, this conclusion holds both for West Germany and Germany as a whole, {{as well as for}} all levels of territorial aggregation (NUTS 1 -NUTS 3). Urban areas are stronger specialised than rural districts, but also subject to faster <b>de-specialisation.</b> Those regions, which have increased regional specialisation against the trend, have performed significantly better in terms of employment growth.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer some {{reflections}} on the Cap reform process, starting from analysis of the objectives and the solidity of its two financial pillars. In {{the first part of}} the paper agricultural expenditure is re-classified on the basis of major Cap intervention typologies, showing how a process of <b>de-specialisation</b> and overlapping of measures between the two pillars is at work. In the second part various financial resource allocation criteria are analysed in the light of the weight attributed to different combinations of five macro-variables: direct payments, disadvantaged area allowances, agricultural area, environmental measures, sector modernisation measures. More in general, the paper sheds light on the necessity to review the two-pillar structure of the Cap and revise its objectives and tools in order to make it more sustainable and more equitable in the long run.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{an issue}} {{related to the}} discussion of national specificity - whether the group of OECD countries are characterised by {{a high degree of}} stability of their export specialisation patterns at the country level or not. During a period of nearly three decades from 1965 to 1992, 20 OECD countries are examined. In addition we test whether the countries, have become more or less specialised in terms of trade specialisation in the period in question. In order to fulfill these aims we examine the sensitivity for, firstly; the level of aggregation, and secondly; the kind of statistical methodology applied. In this context we distinguish between specialisation (or despecialisation) in trade patterns on the one hand, and divergence (or on the contrary convergence) in trade patterns on the other. A specialisation process refers to a process in which specialisation intra-country becomes more dispersed (and counter-wise for <b>de-specialisation).</b> On the contrary, a divergence process refers to a process in which countries become more different in terms of specialisation in a particular sector, across countries (and counter-wise for convergence). The results show that elements of ‘stickiness’ and incremental change are combined for what concerns the intra-country analysis. In addition there is a (however slow) tendency for countries to de-specialise in terms of exports. The sector-wise results display convergence both in terms of - and) -convergence...|$|E
40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{looking at}} the development of international export specialisation patterns have shown {{that there is a}} general tendency for OECD countries to de-specialise. This finding is in contrast to findings made by other authors, working on technological specialisation. These authors found increasing technological specialisation. The first aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether these contradictory findings are due to a !real world phenomenon, or whether the explanation is purely technical, by comparing the development of export specialisation to specialisation in terms of US patents, using the same methodology, and level of aggregation. The second aim is to analyse the extent to which countries and sectors display stable specialisation patterns over time, also both in terms of exports and in terms of technology. The paper confirms that the OECD countries did in general de-specialise in terms of export specialisation. The evidence is less conclusive with regard to technological specialisation, as the results are mixed in the sense that just about half of the countries tend to increase in terms of the level of specialisation, while the other half tend to engage in <b>de-specialisation.</b> In terms of country and sectoral stability of specialisation patterns, it can be concluded that both trade specialisation and technological specialisation patterns are path-dependent in the sense that all country and sectoral patterns are correlated between seven three year intervals, within the period in question. In comparison however, trade specialisation patters are more stable than are technological specialisation patterns...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{fuzzy logic}} and a panel {{logistic}} model, the models suggest 10 configurations (contexts) of sectoral specialisation of the EU regions, the most specialised regions being: Oost Nederland, Ouest FR, Saarland, Sachsen Anhalt, Schleswig Holstein, Thuringen, and Zuid Nederland; and various specialised sectors ranging from: Construction, Electricity gas and water supply, Manufacture of electrical and optical equipment, Real estate renting and business activities, and others. The Sectoral Specialisation of the EU regions was calculated with the Revealed Comparative Advantage method, capturing {{the degree to}} which a given region employs its economically active population (EAP). The results suggest that, for a region, to specialise in any given sector there are two ‘necessary conditions’. Firstly, the sector had to invest heavily in tangible goods (assets), and second, the region had to increase the shares of high and medium-high tech manufacturing employment. Moreover, the results show that the apparent labour productivity of the specialised regions did not have to be higher than the rest of the EU regions. It was also found that high specialisation emerged mostly among regions with high disposable income per capita, and this happens more often not among the largest EU regions. The panel logistic model shows that smart specialisation strategies targeting R&D intensity and R&D personnel at regional levels are potentially useful tools for regional <b>de-specialisation</b> and specialisation, correspondingly. The model is corroborated with the description of two contrasting cases (regions), one specialised and other de-specialised. JRC. J. 2 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{literature}} on the comparative advantage of small versus large banks at lending to small businesses and in light of the worldwide {{decline in the number of}} intermediaries that specialise in this type of lending associated with deregulation in the banking industry, we examine the role that specific categories of banks have played in the context of Italy's regional economic growth. Over the estimation period, 1970 - 1993, which ends in the year of full implementation of the banking reform that introduced statutory <b>de-specialisation</b> and branching liberalisation, Italy featured not only a substantial presence of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the real sector, as is still the case, but also a large and heterogeneous set of credit institutions with different ownership, size and lending styles. Exploiting these peculiarities we study the role of specific intermediaries and gather indirect evidence concerning the likely effects, ceteris paribus, of the current consolidation processes. The main findings, stemming from panel regressions with fixed effects, are as follows. The overall size of the financial sector has a weak impact on growth, but some intermediaries are better than others: cooperative banks and special credit institutions play a positive role, banks of national interest (basically large private banks) and public law banks (government-owned banks) either do not affect growth or have a negative influence depending on how growth is measured. Cooperative banks were mostly small banks and special credit institutions were all but large conglomerates with standardized credit policies, hence our results lend support to the current worldwide concerns of a reduction in the availability of credit to SMEs resulting from consolidation and regulatory reforms in the banking industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{employment}} impact of {{innovation in the}} heterogeneous universe of services is investigated, using data provided by the 1993 – 1995 Italian innovation survey (CIS II). The empirical evidence presented shows that the “direct” impact of innovation on employment varies greatly according {{to the type of}} innovation strategy pursued by firms, across industries and according to the level of qualification of the labour force. High skilled and qualified jobs do replace low skilled jobs. Among small firms and in {{less than half of the}} service sectors considered the net effect is positive, particularly in industries which have a strong scientific and technological base. The negative impact of innovation on employment is on the contrary concentrated among large firms, capital intensive industries and in all financial-related sectors (banking, insurance and other financial services). In the latter industries the labour-saving effect of innovation seems to be linked to the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) which have contributed to rationalise and increase labour productivity in an important section of services. In the case of Italy, an overall negative impact of innovation on employment has been found. This result is clearly affected by the <b>de-specialisation</b> of the Italian economy in the knowledge intensive services. From an innovation-policy perspective two lines of actions can be envisaged: one enhancing efficiency in the technologically laggard service sectors and a second one aiming at creating the conditions for the emergence and growth of knowledge-intensive branches. The evidence presented suggests that both these lines of policy action are important but also that the second one is likely to be more rewarding in terms of employment growth...|$|E
