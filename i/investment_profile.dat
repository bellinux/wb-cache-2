Adopting an institutionalist perspective, I argue that multinational firm <b>investment</b> <b>profiles</b> can be partly {{explained by the}} characteristics of investment promotion policies and bureaucracies charged with their implementation. Brazil's FDI policies were passive and non-discriminating {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s, but became more selective under Lula.

We are interested in the evolutionary emergence of both an efficient investment norm and a bargaining norm. Under some conditions we prove that these norms co-evolve; when this happens they support the efficient investment and the egalitarian distribution of the surplus. In addition, when surplus requires that at least one agent invests, then either both norms co-evolve or no norm evolves. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} {{difficult}} for individual investors {{to choose an}} appropriate online broker due {{to the increase in}} the number of brokers, as well as differences in provided services. In this article, we attempt to give an overview of the most important characteristics of online brokers in Belgium. Subsequently, we identify the most apt online broker for three generic <b>investment</b> <b>profiles</b> (defensive, neutral, aggressive). As the profile becomes more aggressive, traditional banks are outperformed by pure online brokers who combine a lower cost structure with better information services. Interestingly, two brokers (Keytrade;BinckBank) belong to the top 3 providers for each profile. This illustrates that one need not to focus on one profile to be successful. nrpages: 13 status: publishe...|$|R

Increasingly popular is the use of capital market instruments, Private Equity, Venture Capital, Business Angels or Mezzanine. Funding of this kind can finance risky investments in return for a higher expected rate of return on capital. Access to financial resources and the conditions under which entrepreneurs can use them can determine the introduction of new technology, new products and services, expand distribution channels, implement changes that may lead to the growth in competitiveness and above all, innovation, thus the growth of the company.

50|$|Variable or indexed life {{insurance}} {{is a form}} of {{life insurance}} that has cash value linked to the performance of one or more investment accounts within the policy. Because of its investment features, insurance carriers in the United States typically register offerings of variable life insurance with federal and state securities regulators. To register the offering, carriers typically need to provide some level of detail of the investment selections within the policy. Without knowing the specifics of each potential client's <b>investment</b> <b>profile,</b> carriers often settle for registering a uniform offering that includes a selection of mutual funds or hedge funds as investment options within the policy. Not all investments are suitable for placement within these policies. They are better suited to absolute return and hedged strategies rather than equity based investments. Because of the volatility of the stock market the drawdowns within the investment portfolio tend to be larger and the owner may end up having to put more money into the policy to keep it in force if the account value drops considerably.|$|E

As the separation from Interros proceeded, and as other industries caught Prokhorov's attention, the group rapidly changed its <b>investment</b> <b>profile.</b> In April 2008, Prokhorov sold his 25% plus two shares stake in Norilsk Nickel to United Company RUSAL, another mining conglomerate controlled by his fellow billionaire Oleg Deripaska, in exchange for some 14% of Rusal stock, about US$5 billion in cash, and additional payment obligations of US$2 billion. The deal has been singled out as a major success for Prokhorov as only three months later, following a dip in oil prices, a disastrous stock market crash halved the value of most Russian companies, including Norilsk. He {{emerged as one of}} the very few businessmen to have cashed out in time. However, his wealth has also been affected, as the value of his remaining interests in various companies (including Rusal and Open Investments) declined sharply, and as the remaining payment from Rusal had to be postponed but has since been fully paid.|$|E

The study focused {{on the importance of}} the contribution by the first lead investor in a variety of activity areas, as assessed by the investee companies. The study also pays attention to potential adverse effects of the post-investment engagement of the investors on the firm. Using a composite indicator of the extent of the value added, we find no statistically significant difference between the two types of investors. However, the type of value added differs across investor type and, in particular, IVCs contribution proves to be significantly higher than that of GVCs in a number of areas, including the development of the business idea, professionalisation and exit orientation. venture capital...|$|R

This paper identifies constraints on and opportunities for CDM project development in PICs, and proposes a range of specific policy reform measures that could alter existing negative <b>investment</b> <b>profiles.</b> Key findings are that small-scale agricultural projects providing renewable energy from existing sources of biomass (currently seen as waste) are ideal candidates for CDM investment in PICs, and that the single most important reform to facilitate CDM activity and contribute to achieving the MDGs would be the implementation of a regional approach to CDM administration, in which a regional body became the designated CDM Authority for all states in the region. This would offset investment risk, improve governance transparency, and facilitate a targeted approach to sustainable development activities in the Pacific region...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{research}} what marketing investment courage is and how it can impact firms’ financial performance. The literature review provides a theoretical overview of marketing investments, their characteristics and targets, investment courage and the routes through which marketing investment courage can impact firms’ financial performance through actual investments. The empirical study investigates the current state of marketing investment courage among Finnish companies. The empirical data were collected through an online survey aimed at CEOs and marketing directors of Finnish companies. The effective sample of the survey was 545. Several multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the current state of marketing investment courage within Finnish firms. First, the data were analyzed with factor analysis to identify the dimensions of marketing investment courage in terms of investment targets. Second, different marketing <b>investment</b> courage <b>profiles</b> in terms of courage to invest in sets of marketing-related actions and sub-goals were identified by clustering the respondents, and the groups were characterized through contextual background variables. Finally, these groups were examined with analysis of variance to discover the possible differences in financial performance between the groups with different marketing <b>investment</b> courage <b>profiles.</b> The findings of the study identified five dimensions of marketing investment courage in terms of investment targets, named “Awareness creation and communication”, “Customer relationship and product/service development”, “Skilful workforce”, “Distribution networks and company acquisition” and “IT-systems for customer relationship management”. These dimensions were emphasized differently in the different marketing <b>investment</b> courage <b>profiles</b> identified. Differences in the financial performance between the groups were found, especially indicating a lower profit performance of the group having little courage to invest in any marketing-related actions and sub-goals compared to the other groups. The study provides an overall view of the current marketing investment practices in Finland and sheds light on how marketing investment courage can impact financial performance. The results serve as a ground for further investigations concerning particular industries or countries and qualitative studies on the underlying reasons for specific marketing investment practices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{institutional}} quality on the finance–growth nexus. To this end, an empirical model with linear interaction between financial development and institutional quality is estimated. Our main findings show that, while most indicators of financial development have a significantly negative effect on economic growth, {{the sign of the}} coefficients of interaction variables are significantly positive. This provides strong evidence that institutional quality mitigates the negative effect of financial development on economic growth. Looking to the subcomponents of our institutional index, our findings show a development of the banking sector in a country with an important score in Law and Order, Bureaucracy and <b>Investment</b> <b>Profile</b> facilitate growth. Also, countries, with an important score of <b>investment</b> <b>profile,</b> can benefit from stock market development in terms of economic growth.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} that sheds light {{on the influence of}} institutional quality on financial development using data from Middle East and North African (MENA) countries over the period of 1984 - 2007. To measure institutional quality we construct a yearly composite index (INST) using the International Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG). The results of both panel data and IV techniques of estimation show that the institutional quality is more relevant for banking sector than for stock market development. Examining the impact of five sub-indicators of the composite ICRG index on financial sector development, we find that some institutional aspects matter more than others do. While law and order are the most relevant determinant of banking sector development, corruption and <b>investment</b> <b>profile</b> are of secondary importance for banking sector development. We also find that, <b>investment</b> <b>profile</b> is the most relevant determinant of stock market development. It has a positive significant effect on market index and stock market liquidit...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{research}} conducted into Portuguese business angels – a term referring to informal investors – who are private wealthy individuals willing to invest {{a part of their}} own wealth in new business ventures for a profit. The business angel market is partially opaque in that many informal investors are not part of any organisation, club, or network and, therefore, they are difficult to identify (Mason and Harrison 2010; Mason and Harrison 2011). Many, however, are formally organised in clubs, associations, or networks (Amis and Stevenson 2001; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Starting from the visible part of the market—the one linked by networks—and subsequent to the literature review, two relevant topics were identified: business angel <b>profiles</b> and their <b>investment</b> <b>profiles.</b> These two topics were crucial to the design of the questionnaires. Analysis of the questionnaire responses – which included the recipients of two of the most representative informal investor clubs in Portugal – helped to identify the profile of Portuguese business angels and their investments. Although the results of this research (detailed in Document 5 : 3. 2) could not be extrapolated to the entire Portuguese business angel community, the current research will offer future researchers another source in addition to the limited knowledge base available in this area...|$|R
