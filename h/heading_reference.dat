2500|$|The CBA 123 Vector project, {{which cost}} US$300 million, was {{therefore}} cancelled, {{with only two}} prototypes built. [...] Although a failure, the project gave Embraer maturity to work with new technologies, {{which led to the}} development of the successful Embraer ERJ 145 family of jets. Some of these new technologies on the CBA 123 were described in the Federal Aviation Administration response to a request for certification of the aircraft: [...] "This airplane incorporates a number of novel or unusual design features, such as digital avionics including, but not necessarily limited to, an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), attitude and <b>heading</b> <b>reference</b> system (AHRS), engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS), and full authority digital engine control (FADEC), which are vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane. In addition to these novel or unusual design features, the Model CBA-123 also incorporates other unrelated novel or unusual design features. Those features will be the subject of separate notices of proposed special conditions.|$|E
