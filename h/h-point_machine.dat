50|$|Vehicle {{interior}} ergonomics {{are integral}} to an automotive design education. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has adopted tools for vehicle design, including statistical models for predicting driver eye location and seat position {{as well as}} an H-point mannequin for measuring seats and interior package geometry. See SAE J86 for a description of the <b>H-point</b> <b>machine.</b> H-Point machines have been built by Technosports of Livonia, Michigan. Occupant posture-prediction models are used in computer simulations and form the basis for Crash test dummy positioning.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the main}} design {{objectives}} for car interiors are comfort and safety. These aspects are both determined by the seating position of the occupant. Seat manufacturers use the SAE Three-Dimensional H-Point Machine™ to measure seating positions to design, audit, and benchmark seats. The seating positions measured with the <b>H-Point</b> <b>Machine</b> {{form the basis of}} a seat design, including comfort and safety aspects. Currently, the seat design process is largely based on prototype testing, which makes this process time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, there is a large demand for efficient design tools that enable an optimal combination of seating comfort and safety aspects. Numerical modeling provides an efficient means to optimally combine various seat design characteristics prior to prototype testing, thereby reducing design costs and time-to-market. Therefore, the ability to predict the H-point and the corresponding comfort and safety aspects {{in the early stages of}} the seat design process is extremely valuable to car and seat manufacturers. This paper presents a numerical model of the commonly used SAE Three-Dimensional H-Point Machine™. The model was developed using a combination of multibody and finite element (FE) techniques. The applicability of the H-Point Model was verified in two steps. Firstly, tests in which the <b>H-Point</b> <b>Machine</b> was placed on a block of foam were simulated. The measured position of the <b>H-Point</b> <b>Machine</b> was compared to that predicted by the model. After this, the H-Point Model was used together with a full FE seat model to predict the H-point of an actual car seat. The predictions with the H-Point Model were also compared with similar simulations with a FE model of the human pelvis. The FE pelvis model provides a more realistic prediction of the seating posture of a real human, since the deformation of the flesh is incorporated in this model. Based on the simulations, it can be concluded that the H-point can be accurately predicted with the numerical approach presented in this paper. The level of accuracy was found to greatly depend on how accurate the seat foam is modeled (e. g. mesh density, foam characteristics) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This article {{describes}} {{a new and}} more repeatable, reproducible, and valid test method for characterizing lumbar support in automotive seating. Background: Lumbar support is important because it affects occupant accommodation and perceptions of seat comfort. Assessing only the lumbar mechanism—particularly in terms of travel—is inad-equate because it does not consider the effects of trim and foam. Method: The Society of Automotive Engineers ’ next-generation <b>H-Point</b> <b>machine</b> and associated loading pro-tocol were used {{as the basis for the}} new test. Results: The method was found to satisfy minimum gage repeatability and reproducibility requirements. Validity was demonstrated through a regression model that revealed 93. 9 % of the variance in subjective ratings of poor uncomfortable lumbar support can be explained by two objective indicators: (1) lumbar support prominence in the full-off position and (2) effective travel. Conclusion: The method can be used to differentiate between seats offering two-way adjustable lumbar support. The best two-way adjustable lumbar seat systems are those that cou-ple little to no lumbar support in the starting or off position (i. e., they are nonintrusive) with a considerable amount of effective or perceptible travel. Application: The auto-motive industry has long needed a way to address the fact that consumers want more lumbar support than their seats currently supply. This contribution offers a method to objectify an important aspect of automotive seating comfort—namely, lumbar support. This should help human factors professionals produce, but not necessarily guarantee, better consumer ratings...|$|E
