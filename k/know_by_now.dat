He also said that both the roles would have multiple layers and added, [...] "The film as you all would <b>know</b> <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> is spread across three generations, and all the characters go back and forth in time. I play a happy-go-lucky college guy in the present era. It's a typically fun character and has nothing in common with my character from the flashback. So acting wise, it was a big challenge". He described the drunk scenes shared with Nagarjuna, Nageswara Rao and his confrontation scene with Samantha {{towards the end of the}} film as the toughest scenes to act.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics show Madonna's {{interest}} in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who admits to her father that she is pregnant and refuses {{to have an abortion}} or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her to do. It is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, [...] "You should <b>know</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> that I'm not a baby". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word [...] "Please". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main hook in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna's musical style.|$|E
500|$|Forrest Wickman of Slate {{magazine}} defended Beyoncé's {{choice to}} use the sample, and criticized the media reports for their [...] "dismissive" [...] interpretation of the song's [...] "vague" [...] lyrics as being about [...] "a girl in a relationship". According to Wickman, the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and [...] "the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them, {{because you never know}} when that could be"; this is shown in the hook lines, [...] "Baby kiss me / Before they turn the lights out / You better kiss me / Before our time has run out." [...] A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a [...] "trivialization", instead describing it as [...] "a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment". Wickman concluded, [...] "If there's anything anyone should <b>know</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> about Beyoncé Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self-presentation that isn't carefully chosen." ...|$|E

6000|$|I have a {{very simple}} motive and excuse for telling the little I know of this true tale. I have met in my wanderings a man {{brought up in the}} lower {{quarters}} of a great house, fed mainly on its leavings and burdened mostly with its labours. I know that his complaints are stilled, and his status justified, by a story that is told to him. It is about how his grandfather was a chimpanzee and his father a wild man of the woods, caught by hunters and tamed into something like intelligence. In the light of this, he may well be thankful for the almost human life that he enjoys; and may be content with the hope of leaving behind him a yet more evolved animal. Strangely enough, the calling of this story by the sacred name of Progress ceased to satisfy me when I began to suspect (and to discover) that it is not true. I <b>know</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> enough at least of his origin to know that he was not evolved, but simply disinherited. His family tree is not a monkey tree, save in the sense that no monkey could have climbed it; rather it is like that tree torn up by the roots and named [...] "Dedischado," [...] on the shield of the unknown knight.|$|E
