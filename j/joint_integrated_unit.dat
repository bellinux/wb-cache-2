5000|$|The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sudan. According to 2011 IISS estimates, it numbers 109,300 personnel. They {{comprises}} Land Forces, the Sudanese Navy, the Sudanese Air Force, and the Popular Defence Forces. They also {{previously had}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Units</b> formed together with its rebel enemies the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The Armed Forces {{operate under the}} authority of the People's Armed Forces Act 1986. In 1991, the Library of Congress used the term [...] "Sudan People's Armed Forces" [...] to refer to the entire armed forces, but by the late 2000s (decade), the [...] "Sudanese Armed Forces" [...] term was most widespread. In 2004, the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress estimated that the Popular Defence Forces, the military wing of the National Islamic Front, consists of 10,000 active members, with 85,000 reserves. It has been deployed alongside regular army units against various rebel groups.|$|R
5000|$|Following the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement {{which ended}} the second civil war, the Sudanese Armed Forces formed joint {{military}} units with the Sudanese People's Liberation Army. These <b>units,</b> the <b>Joint</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Units,</b> were commanded by Major General Thomas Cirillo Swaka. With the probable {{dissolution of the}} JIUs following the Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011, the SPLA components {{are expected to be}} either integrated back into the SPLA or be demobilised. The SPLA components however are a lesser concern than the SAF components. Many of the SAF JIU personnel are former militia ('Other Armed Groups' or OAGs) who were 'aligned' rather than being formally 'incorporated' within the northern army. 'Aside from regular SAF units in locations such as Malakal and Bor, many of the SAF elements of the JIUs hail from the areas where they are serving and have strong family ties in these locations. As with the SPLA components, integration into the SPLA or increased incentives to demobilize are the only options the SAF components are likely to consider—movement north being out of the question.' ...|$|R

Sixty-eight total objectives were integrated into seven thematic units; 55 objectives spanned the subjects of Art, Education for Employment, Language Arts, Math, Music, Physical Education, Reading, Science and Social Studies and 13 objectives for health education.

40|$|In {{situations}} with {{a significant}} number of targets in mutual proximity (close to each other), optimal multitarget data association approach suffers from the numerical explosion. This severely limits the applicability, i. e., the number of close targets that may be reliably tracked. We propose an iterative implementation of the <b>joint</b> <b>integrated</b> probabilistic data association (JIPDA) which allows a performance/computation resources tradeoff. This approach can also be incorporated into <b>joint</b> <b>integrated</b> track splitting (JITS). The iterations start with the single target integrated probabilistic data association (IPDA) and each subsequent iteration improves the approximation towards JIPDA, reaching the optimal multitarget solution within a finite number of iterations.

40|$|Major global {{transnational}} {{companies are}} increasing their presence at Russian market, but shipyards can stand this competition only {{in case of}} their transformation into powerful <b>integrated</b> <b>units</b> similar to the international analogs. Because there is no unified approach for mechanism of formation and interaction of <b>integrated</b> <b>units</b> creation of such mechanism is the precise problem for research. The mechanism of formation of corporate <b>integrated</b> <b>units</b> {{is defined as a}} variety of tools and methods to influence the object of integration process and the set of motivation leverages and forms of communication between participants through out which originators can reach their precise targets. In the variety of modern research works the mechanism of formation of corporate units is based on such instruments of influence as coordination, control, centralization; in some other researches the mechanisms based on interface and communication between parties involved in a process are fixed. Definition of integration principles {{plays an important role in}} the development of the mechanism of formation of corporate <b>integrated</b> <b>units</b> as well as the factors of direct and indirect impact of outside and inside environment; taking into account all mentioned principles will lead to achievement of efficient processes of integration as well as adaptive stability in functioning of corporate units...|$|R

This study recognized that many educational reports since 1983, have recommended major changes in the structure of schools, curriculum, and teaching profession. This study documented and evaluated the outcome of an attempt to involve teachers in integrating the curriculum. Specifically, the author used an Ecological Theory to analyze the development of the <b>integrated</b> <b>units,</b> teaching of the <b>integrated</b> <b>units,</b> faculty interactions, teacher principal interactions, and effects of central office mandates and restrictions on the project. The author discusses the components of this project which other educational leaders might consider as they plan staff development projects.
