In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search <b>effort,</b> went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search <b>effort.</b> On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search <b>effort</b> was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E

40|$|According to Roger S Pressman “Software <b>efforts</b> {{estimation}} is not {{an exact}} science”. Day per day competition in the software industries is increasing; in such scenario accurate <b>efforts</b> estimation is become an important task. <b>Efforts</b> estimation is one of essential activity of software development which is providing basis for other software activities like scheduling, planning. Software cost and <b>efforts</b> estimation is become a challenge for IT industries. There are lot of methods are existing for <b>efforts</b> and cost estimation, but people {{do not know how}} to use these methods. Industries only concentrating on KLOC for <b>efforts</b> estimation, but there is a lot of other parameter like <b>efforts</b> of reuse must be include in <b>efforts</b> estimation. IT industries are making two types of project. First, which has a specific customer; all requirements are given by this customer. Second, in which requirement are gather by using some survey In case of second type of project <b>efforts</b> estimation become much difficult because we do not have a specific customer and we have to estimate <b>efforts</b> accurately and complete the project within time limit,because we have a no of competitors. So a systematic approach is required for <b>efforts</b> estimation. This paper is suggesting a systematic way of <b>efforts</b> estimation, which will cover all phases of software development and it is trying to involve all those parameter that may affect the <b>efforts</b> of a software project...|$|R

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{computational}} model of organizational adaptation to answer three research questions: (1) How does the architecture or structure of complexity affect the feasibility and usefulness of boundedly rational design <b>efforts?</b> (2) Do <b>efforts</b> to adapt organizational forms complicate or complement {{the effectiveness of}} first-order change <b>efforts?</b> and (3) To what extent does the rate of environmental change nullify the usefulness of design <b>efforts?</b> We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to examine these questions. Our results, in identifying the boundary conditions around successful design <b>efforts,</b> suggest that the underlying architecture of complexity of organizations, particularly the presence of hierarchy, is a critical determinant of the feasibility and effectiveness of design <b>efforts.</b> We also find that design <b>efforts</b> are generally complementary to <b>efforts</b> at local performance improvement and identify specific contingencies that {{determine the extent of}} complementarity.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how different employment relationships in academic settings, ie tenured versus non-tenured appointments, {{are associated with}} different types of job performance <b>efforts.</b> The social embeddedness model contends that employees' <b>efforts</b> to perform well depend on embeddedness in the social environment.

Regression analyses on the responses of both tenured and non-tenured faculty members show that employees' <b>efforts</b> to perform well {{can be explained by}} social embeddedness. Temporal embeddedness appears to be important in explaining the job performance <b>efforts</b> of tenured faculty members, while, in contrast, network embeddedness seems important in explaining the <b>efforts</b> of nontenured faculty members; and institutional embeddedness explained the <b>efforts</b> of both groups of faculty members...|$|R
