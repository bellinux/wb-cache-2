40|$|Background: Rapid {{and simple}} methods for {{diagnosing}} human influenza A (H 5 N 1) disease urgently needed. The limited data so far {{suggest that the}} currently available rapid antigen <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> have poor clinical sensitivity for diagnosis of human H 5 N 1 disease. Objectives: To compare the analytical sensitivity of six commercially available rapid antigen <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> for the <b>detection</b> of "human" (subtypes H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2) and "avian" (subtype H 5 N 1) influenza A viruses. Study design: Six commercially available test <b>kits</b> for the <b>detection</b> of influenza A were investigated. Analytic sensitivity {{for the detection of}} two contemporary H 1 N 1, two H 3 N 2 and three H 5 N 1 viruses was determined using virus culture as a reference method. Results and conclusions: Each test kit detected the H 5 N 1 virus subtypes as efficiently as they detected conventional human viruses of subtypes H 1 N 1 or H 3 N 2. However, limits of detection of influenza viruses of all subtypes by antigen <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> were > 1000 -fold lower than virus isolation. Thus, the reportedly poor clinical sensitivity of these antigen <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> for diagnosis of patients with H 5 N 1 disease is not due to a difference of sensitivity for detecting avian influenza H 5 N 1 compared to human influenza viruses. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Federal {{workplace}} {{drug testing}} was initiated {{during the late}} 1980 s. Since then, numerous methods have been employed to subvert these drug tests, adulteration of urine samples being the most common. A wide variety of adulterants {{has been reported to}} date along with suitable methods of their detection. Recently, websites have claimed that zinc sulfate can be an effective adulterant to bypass drug testing. Herein, these claims are investigated using standard drug <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> and urine samples adulterated with zinc. Drug-free urine samples were fortified with different amounts methamphetamines and benzoylecgonine, to which zinc sulfate was added to study its effect. Urine samples from acute marijuana smokers were also obtained in order to study the effects of zinc supplements on THC drug testing. All urine drug testing was performed using ELISA <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> manufactured by Immunalysis. Both zinc sulfate and zinc supplements are effective in interfering with the detection of all three drugs by Immunalysis drug <b>detection</b> <b>kits.</b> Also, no suitable method could be established to detect zinc in urine samples. Zinc can be an effective adulterant in urine for some illicit drugs that are commonly screened under routine drug testing...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the performances of four Helicobacter pylori serological <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> in different target groups, using Amplified IDEIA™ Hp StAR™ as gold standard. Kits studied were Rapid Immunochromatoghraphic Hexagon, Helicoblot 2. 1, an EIA IgG kit and EIA IgA kit. Stool and blood samples were collected from 162 apparently healthy participants (control) and 60 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) patients. The performances of the four serological <b>detection</b> <b>kits</b> were found to be affected by gender, age, health status and ethnicity of the participants. In the control group, the Helicoblot 2. 1 kit had the best performance (AUC = 0. 85; p< 0. 05, accuracy = 86. 4 %), followed by EIA IgG (AUC = 0. 75; p< 0. 05, accuracy = 75. 2 %). The Rapid Hexagon and EIA IgA kits had relatively poor performances. In the T 2 DM subgroup, the kits H 2. 1 and EIA IgG had best performances, with accuracies of 96. 5 % and 93. 1 % respectively. The performance of EIA IgG improved with adjustment of its cut-off value.

50|$|AUL {{has argued}} {{against the use}} of certain drugs {{including}} contraceptives {{that can be used to}} induce abortion, and also early-pregnancy gender detection tests. In 1995 the group filed a petition with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that demanded the agency apply the strictest possible standards when reviewing a drug used to induce abortions, RU-486. Later, in 2009 and 2010, the organization opposed the FDA approval of the contraceptive drug Ulipristal acetate (also known under the brand name ella). It argued that the pill caused abortions and campaigned for the FDA to not approve the drug for use in the U.S. The group has also voiced opposition towards an early-pregnancy gender <b>detection</b> <b>kit</b> called the Baby Gender Mentor. It stated that learning the gender at such an early point may lead some parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. AUL claims that some women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early.|$|E
