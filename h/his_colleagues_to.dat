In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government {{was planning to}} fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E
5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished. Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's leader to bolster the new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak Moderate Party collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E

In Athens, he met Nan Stevens, the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After {{returning}} from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> convince him {{to try out for}} the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. He did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career.|$|E
5|$|While in London, Burnet became {{engaged to}} fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a {{secondary}} school teacher and {{daughter of a}} barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she {{had to return to}} Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.|$|E

She can only sympathize with Dexter, however, for having to hide such an enormous secret, and refuses to unlock Doakes's cage. Convinced that Dexter is her soul mate, Lila tries to help him by blowing up the cabin with Doakes inside. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy's (Keith Carradine) task force has determined Doakes's location, and Dexter must race <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> reach the cabin first. When he arrives at the cabin, he discovers {{that it has been}} destroyed in a fire and at first believes it to be a miracle. The next morning, the police find Doakes's body in the water, while Dexter embraces his freedom. He visits his girlfriend Rita Bennett's (Julie Benz) house, where they reconcile after having sex.|$|E

Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.|$|E
25|$|The fourth plane {{apparently}} {{had been holding}} back waiting for <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> open a favorable route of attack. He then circled, banked to his left, and dove at Tatum. Her barrage ripped off part of his left wing, and he plummeted toward the water, splashing into the sea about 30feet from her port bow. Then an underwater explosion rocked Tatum severely but caused no damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding Serpico's shooting quickly came into question. Serpico, who was armed during the drug raid, {{had been shot}} only after briefly {{turning away from the}} suspect when he realized that the two officers who had accompanied him to the scene were not following him into the apartment, raising the question whether Serpico had actually been brought to the apartment by <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> be murdered. There was no formal investigation.|$|E

25|$|At first Gambetta {{was opposed}} to the war with Prussia. He did not, like some of his colleagues, refuse to vote for funds for the army, but took a {{patriotic}} line and accepted that the war had been forced on France. When {{the news of the}} disaster at Sedan reached Paris, Gambetta called for strong measures. He proclaimed the deposition of the emperor at the corps législatif, and the establishment of a republic at the Hôtel de Ville. He {{was one of the first}} members of the new Government of National Defense, becoming Minister of the Interior. He advised <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> leave Paris and run the government from some provincial city.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>to</b> emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|R

Afterwards, Khánh played back the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression that Taylor was calling {{for them to be}} expelled. Khánh asked <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> participate in a campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and {{to give the impression that}} the country did not need aid from Washington.|$|E
25|$|Many European Jewish fathers {{during the}} nineteenth century chose not to circumcise their sons, {{including}} Theodor Herzl. However, unlike many other forms of religious observance, it remained one of the last rituals Jewish communities could enforce. In most of Europe, both the government and the unlearned Jewish masses believed circumcision to be a rite akin to baptism, and the law allowed communities not to register uncircumcised children as Jewish. This legal maneuver spurred several debates addressing the advisibility of its use, since many parents later chose to convert to Christianity. In early 20th-century Russia, Chaim Soloveitchik advised <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> reject this measure, stating that uncircumcised Jewish males are no less Jewish than Jews who violate other commandments.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{and some}} of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, {{to work with the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Clinton Engineer Works, where he became the {{assistant}} director of chemistry.

The techniques discovered by the team proved to be the groundwork for those used at the Hanford Site which provided the plutonium for the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Just four months later he completed Must Destruction Be Our Destiny? (1945), a book detailing the dangers of nuclear weapons. He gave 102 lectures to promote the book, donating the royalties from the book to an organisation that later became part of the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
