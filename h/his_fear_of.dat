5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

5|$|Because of <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> demagoguery {{and belief}} {{the people of}} the United States could be easily misled, Gerry also {{advocated}} indirect elections.

5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that there would be some sort of clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E

60|$|I {{waited a}} little while longer, then rising I {{cautiously}} made a tour of inspection. Peace reigned everywhere, and {{the only sign of}} life was the sentry, who with musket on shoulder paced in front of the main entrance, a silent testimony of St. Auban's mistrust of the Blaisois and <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a possible surprise.|$|R
5|$|The game's logo artwork {{was drawn}} by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol {{used in the}} logo was drawn by Naora, who had {{designed}} the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium {{was based on an}} offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{seems to}} recover, {{but the next}} day, the {{producers}} find Truman sleeping in his basement. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, only to find he has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched, going to such extreme measures as causing the artificial sun to rise hours ahead of schedule. Audiences {{around the world are}} drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.|$|E
60|$|Never {{since the}} ephemeral season of their {{courtship}} {{had she been}} on such fond terms with him, and all <b>his</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> hostile designs entertained against him by her immediate followers were stilled at last.

50|$|Debutante Rajesh Shringarpore's {{character}} of Sanjay Somji in Sarkar Raj was also reportedly based on Raj Thackeray, the estranged nephew of political leader Bal Thackeray; thus furthering the general viewpoint that {{the series is}} based on Bal Thackeray and his family.

50|$|On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) {{was elected}} speaker. The {{powerful}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, {{is said to}} have voiced <b>his</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years.|$|R
5|$|After {{his return}} {{home from the}} {{sanatorium}} in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, {{he was laid off}} and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me that nothing could be worse than <b>his</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> an elevator.|$|E

60|$|So {{this was}} the plan he had been {{brooding}} over on our journey. No wonder he had been absent-minded. Cold with dread I gazed {{at him in the}} obscurity of the tent. A glimpse of Adam's rabbit face as he had stood brazening out <b>his</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> the showman on that first night of adventure had darted through my mind. And this man--dwarfed, shrunken, emaciated.|$|R
