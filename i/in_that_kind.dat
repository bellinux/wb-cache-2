500|$|Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom deemed [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] a {{song with}} [...] "a clever sample and a {{particularly}} infectious hook". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt considered the song the album's standout {{and said that}} it [...] "excellently jacks a sample from soft-rock smash 'Baby Come Back'." [...] In a more mixed review, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] three stars out of five and commented that the song sounded unoriginal and said that several other songs {{appeared to have been}} [...] "mashed together" [...] to create it. Furthermore, McAlpine said: [...] "Vanessa acquits herself well on the vocals... but it's a bit overproduced and slightly soulless <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of relentlessly-perky way that graduates of the school of Disney stardom sometimes have." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of scenario, it's {{not a good idea}} to have a lot of people around because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Newman {{composed}} the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that [...] "there was {{room for a}} real tune-based score here that could reflect the basic joy <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an [...] "adaptation score" [...] of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, {{so that he could}} [...] "listen to what the music does to an image", and not wanting to [...] "clutter the proceedings with music." [...] The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, [...] "You had to turn on a dime to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers are working on the script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.” For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were [...] "appropriate to the time period", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including [...] "Chim Chim Cher-ee", [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar", [...] "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank", [...] "Feed the Birds", and [...] "Let's Go Fly a Kite". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Blu began {{a project}} in Los Angeles, {{recording}} some swing and jazz songs which he had written over the years along with some classic standards which had been favorites of his. Heavily influenced by artists like Harry Connick Jr. in his early life (and more recently Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and Brian Setzer), Blu recorded his first independent Swing/Jazz album <b>In</b> Just <b>That</b> <b>Kind</b> Of A Mood. After finding licensing opportunities for some of his songs, including <b>In</b> Just <b>That</b> <b>Kind</b> Of A Mood and Ooh-Wee, which were featured on The Young and the Restless in 2007 and 2008, Blu decided to drop everything in China, {{move back to the}} United States and take a risk on initiating his music career back home. Returning to his musical roots in Swing and Smooth Jazz, Blu began writing and recording more original songs in the genre which would ultimately set him apart from major label singers like Michael Bublé, Jamie Cullum, and Harry Connick Jr.. Blu has since had his album <b>In</b> Just <b>That</b> <b>Kind</b> Of A Mood released in Eastern Europe by Universal Music Group (2008), released a new Swing/Jazz EP In A Groove (2008), been featured on multiple Swing and Smooth Jazz Compilation CDs (see Discography) and recorded a Latin Standards project with Peer Music, slated for possible release in 2009.|$|R

2500|$|Much to {{the chagrin}} of Warner Bros., Russell decided to use a number of {{experimental}} cinematic techniques in the film. Handheld cameras and Steadicam shots were used to give the film a journalistic feel. Russell shot a majority of the film on Ektachrome transparency stock that was cross processed in colour negative chemicals, to reproduce [...] "the odd colour of the newspaper images [...]" [...] Though the process produced a unique quality and look to the film, it was exceedingly unreliable to develop, and many film labs would not provide insurance for the transparency stock if it did not develop properly. Russell feared that the scenes would need to be reshot until finally a lab was found that would develop the transparency stock in the negative chemicals. The opening was shot on conventional negative stock and bleach bypassed to give a deep black and high contrast look. Some interior shots were also filmed on conventional negative stock and processed normally. Russell also credited the realism of the firefights to the film's cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, who had shot several documentaries on South American civil wars, saying [...] "he knew {{what it was like to}} be <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Silas {{sets his}} sights on Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) as his next {{potential}} victim. Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Lee Hunter (Alex Carter) start their own radio show and recruit Lynsey to be their on-air agony aunt. Lynsey's advice to [...] "sexually charged" [...] young people does not go down well with Silas. Hassan said that Silas assumes the worst about Lynsey. Silas grows more furious when Lynsey dresses up in a sexy nurse's outfit for the radio's webcam. Lynsey is [...] "horrified" [...] as her flat becomes dark and Silas grabs her from behind. However, Silas is scared off as Lynsey's screams are heard by Silas's grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), who arrives to rescue her. Lynsey realises that it was Silas who attacked her and tells people, {{but they do not}} believe her. Discussing the plot, Bronagh Waugh (who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl Brady) explained that everyone thinks that Lynsey is crazy and making the allegation up. She said [...] "Lynsey's really upset about it and asks Cheryl for some help. While she hates seeing her best friend <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of state, she thinks Lynsey's just being paranoid and Silas is a really upstanding member of society." [...] As no one accepts Lynsey's allegation, she wants to bring Silas down even more. Hassan stated that Lynsey is determined to find the evidence she needs to expose Silas. Riley realises that Lynsey is telling the truth and confronts Silas, who has a heart attack. Riley brings Silas into hospital, but Lynsey is not sure whether Silas is genuinely ill. Lynsey is assigned as his nurse and withholds his oxygen mask until he admits that he attacked her. Heidi walks in on Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and Lynsey calls for help. Norbury later told Digital Spy that he did not think Riley's suspicions of Silas would ever completely go and [...] "everything that happened shook [...] up a bit".|$|E
