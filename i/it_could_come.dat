25|$|Ironically, Gore drowned on 18 February 1812, off {{the coast}} of Africa. A seaman had fallen {{overboard}} and Gore again jumped in to save the man. The ship's boats attempted to save him but one swamped before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to the rescue, and he capsized a second trying to climb in. The cutter was able to rescue the men from the second boat, but Gore and the seaman he had tried to save were already lost.|$|E
25|$|While a {{large number}} of Dvořák's works were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical {{relationship}} to the order in which they were either written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to present budding composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák deliberately provided new works with lower opus numbers to be able to sell them outside contract obligations to other publishers. An example is the Czech Suite which Dvořák didn't want to sell to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. In this way <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> about that the same opus number was given to more than one of Dvořák's works; for example the opus number 12, which was assigned, successively, to: the opera King and Charcoal Burner (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In yet other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of the name [...] "Teaneck" [...] is not known, but {{speculation}} is that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> from various Dutch or English words, {{or it could be}} Native American in origin, meaning [...] "the woods". An alternative is from the Dutch [...] "Tiene Neck" [...] meaning [...] "neck where there are willows" [...] (from the Dutch [...] "tene" [...] meaning willow).|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} the election, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., to preside over the Senate's lame duck session. Lazarus Powell, now a senator, proposed a resolution creating a committee of thirteen members {{to respond to the}} portion of Buchanan's address regarding the disturbed condition of the country. Breckinridge appointed the members of the committee, which, in Heck's opinion, formed [...] "an able committee, representing every major faction". John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise by which slavery would be forbidden in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north—the demarcation line used in the Missouri Compromise—and permitted south of it, but the committee's five Republicans rejected the proposal. On December 31, the committee reported that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to no agreement. Writing to Magoffin on January 6, Breckinridge complained that the Republicans were [...] "rejecting everything, proposing nothing" [...] and [...] "pursuing a policy which... threatens to plunge the country into... civil war".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{over the course}} of two days in Nashville, Tennessee. On the first day, {{performance}} scenes were filmed inside the Sommet Center (now named the Bridgestone Arena), and involved pyrotechnics. Swift was at first nervous about the shoot, as it was her first experience with pyrotechnics. [...] "There are some things I'm nervous about. My hair could very well catch on fire", she said. She was later assured of its safety and explained to about the discrepancy in the distance of the fire in reality than on camera: on camera, it appears to be quite close to her, whereas, in actuality, it was placed far behind her. On the second day, the remaining scenes were filmed at a suburban house in Nashville. Props were provided by the video personnel. On the set, Fanjoy suggested using a binoculars for the primary scenes, but Swift disagreed, believing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> across as cheesy depending on how it was filmed. She ultimately succumbed to the idea due to Fanjoy explaining how it would translate on camera.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> from the person next door." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wary of the {{consequences}} of a legal ruling, the presiding judge, Robert P. Patterson, Jr., urged the parties to settle, saying, [...] "I’m concerned that this case is more lawyer-driven than it is client-driven.

2500|$|When the ECW brand officially {{launched}} on the Sci Fi channel, Dreamer and the Sandman were put {{into one of the}} brands first feuds, an [...] "old school versus new school" [...] feud, against Test and Mike Knox. In November and December he engaged in a short feud with Daivari and The Great Khali, but Khali was sent to the Raw brand before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to a conclusion. Not long after Khali left ECW, The New Breed stable was established, consisting of wrestlers new to ECW: Elijah Burke, Marcus Cor Von, Matt Striker and Kevin Thorn. In response, a stable of ECW Originals was created, and the teams continued to clash in singles and tag matches, trading wins on the weekly ECW show throughout the spring of 2007, while both sides tried to get CM Punk to side with them. The Originals won a standard-rules four-on-four match at WrestleMania 23, which would be Dreamer's first and only match ever on the maincard of a WrestleMania. The Originals lost an extreme-rules rematch on the following edition of ECW. The feud continued until a number of roster moves left both sides nearly barren, with it ending at One Night Stand when Dreamer, Sandman and Punk beating Burke, Cor Von and Striker in a Tables match.|$|E
