She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him {{that she did not}} need to <b>hear</b> <b>anything,</b> because she already knew what her father would have said.|$|E
5|$|Data, an android, and Jenna D'Sora {{are in the}} torpedo room {{configuring}} several probes {{with which}} the Enterprise will explore a nearby nebula. D'Sora explains that she just split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists {{that he could not}} <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> wrong.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did not <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E

25|$|In a two wire {{system the}} {{standard}} arrangement for diver communications {{is to have}} the diver's side normally on, so that the surface team can <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message. In a four-wire system the diver's side is always on, even when the surface operator is talking.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} {{arrangement with}} wired diver communications {{is to have}} the diver's side normally on, so that the surface team can <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message. This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor the diver's breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive.|$|E
25|$|In a {{flashback}} {{to the night}} of October 5, on the Wapi Casino's tenth floor, Jamie, Ames (Barclay Hope) and Chief Jackson (Claudia Ferri) discuss the Indian bones. All prepare to leave, but Jamie stays behind after hearing the noise of a phone ringing. As he walks back, he discovers Rosie. Jamie questions Rosie, who insists she did not <b>hear</b> <b>anything.</b> Rosie then accidentally drops her camera. As Jamie suspiciously walks {{to pick up the}} camera, Rosie tries to escape, but Jamie grabs her. Rosie starts screaming, but Jamie punches her to keep her quiet, knocking her unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Bart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman {{and others}} {{critical}} of traditional Christian views, {{in assessing the}} problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by {{people who did not}} know Jesus, see anything he did, or <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.|$|E
25|$|The couple's {{divorce is}} {{finalized}} in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with the Vic's caterer, Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) instead. When he discovers {{that they are}} seeing each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws {{him out of his}} home in the Vic. Whilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, Sonny. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves Walford for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see or <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> of each other again.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Russell described {{the state of}} mind he felt he needed to enter {{in order to be}} able to play basketball as, “I had to almost be in a rage. Nothing went on outside the borders of the court. I could <b>hear</b> <b>anything,</b> I could see anything, and nothing mattered. And I could anticipate every move that every player made.” ...|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} bedside, and {{was shocked at}} the deathly pallor of his face. His eyes were half closed. He had not the air of <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> that we said. I walked towards {{the door with the}} doctor.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{this made}} Sammy feel very proud and very happy. You {{know it is}} very seldom that he <b>hears</b> <b>anything</b> nice said of him. He flew down on the stump {{of one of the}} trees Paddy had cut. [...] "Let's be friends," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|Alas! The {{conversation}} {{inside was}} being carried on in too low a tone to permit of her <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> of it. She dared not reopen the door, however gently.

500|$|McKinley {{expected}} {{the election to}} be fought {{on the issue of}} tariffs; he was a well-known protectionist. The Democrats met in convention in July in Chicago; former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland was deemed likely to be the nominee. [...] As McKinley awaited his opponent, he privately commented on the nationwide debate over silver, stating to his Canton crony, Judge Day, that [...] "This money matter is unduly prominent. [...] In thirty days you won't <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> about it." [...] The future Secretary of State and Supreme Court justice responded: [...] "In my opinion in thirty days you won't hear of anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the boat}} deck, as the crew began {{preparing}} the lifeboats, {{it was difficult}} to <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
500|$|At the Source Awards, Tracy {{still does}} not want to host. Jack rhetorically asks him what Oprah would do, but Tracy misunderstands and starts acting like her. Backstage, Tracy shows Liz his gun, which she takes away from him. She fires it by {{accident}} and ends up shooting Steven in the buttocks. He thinks she shot him because he was going through her purse and calls her a racist. Following this, Ridikolous comes in and says that Jack has made a mockery of the award, adding: [...] "Wait until I tell Tupac about this!". This leads to a short awkward moment, but Jack insists he did not <b>hear</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{reason is}} that while the {{association}} of the H-bomb is irrelevant to it, it would today come to everyone's mind. Another is that he is not sure the world will end with either. People whose houses were bombed have told him they don't remember <b>hearing</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R

500|$|The song [...] "Gala Gala" [...] {{was shot}} in the {{province}} of Phuket in Thailand, and the city of Bangkok. Prior to the filming of the song [...] "Jagadame", Shyam K. Naidu was busy on the set of Munna (2007) and was unable to shoot it so cinematographer K. V. Guhan, who had worked on Mahesh's Athadu (2005), was recruited instead. The film's climax sequences were shot in March 2006 at the defunct Binny Mills located in Chennai under the supervision of FEFSI Vijayan. He suggested that Jagannadh include a scene where Prakash Raj fails to <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> for a while after he is hit by Mahesh during the climax sequence.|$|E
500|$|Physically, kitsune {{are noted}} for having {{as many as}} nine tails. Generally, {{a greater number of}} tails {{indicates}} an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These [...] gain the abilities to see and <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience). After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a golden color, becoming a , the most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens.|$|E
500|$|Stone Temple Pilots {{marks the}} first time Robert and Dean have written {{together}} since Army of Anyone's only release in 2006; some of Dean's contributions date from this period, but [...] "Dare If You Dare" [...] was written while Talk Show was touring. Robert and Dean began writing new material by November 2008, but, except for clips played during the tour sound checks, Weiland would not <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> new until after February 2009. [...] The recording process took place over a period of ten months, due largely to the band's touring schedule, but the majority of actual studio time was spent experimenting with different instruments and miking techniques. Pre-production for the album took place at Kretz's Bomb Shelter Studios and consisted mainly of Dean, Robert, and Kretz sifting through musical ideas.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all well}} enough," [...] Lionel agreed; [...] "but the {{question}} is, {{how are we}} to hear what they are saying inside? We are obliged to shout to catch each others' words now, and there is not the least chance of our <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> through the closed shutters." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{far more}} anxiously did the Queen recur to {{examining}} Cicely {{on what she}} had gathered from Humfrey. This was in fact nothing, for {{he had been on}} his guard against either telling or <b>hearing</b> <b>anything</b> inconsistent with loyalty to the English Queen, and thus had avoided conversation on these subjects.|$|R
500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman {{could not imagine}} Strupper playing on the football team: [...] "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E
500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that [...] " [...] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge to <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals {{in the space between}} the beat and the new raps." [...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like try to do what was already done. [...] brought other parts to the sample that you caught that I was like, 'Oh, nice!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on our second issue by the time I saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening. I made a decision—which I pretty much regret at this point—I said, 'You know what? It's so different , I will probably never <b>hear</b> <b>anything</b> about this.' And I was wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In an hour," [...] he said, [...] "it will be {{safe for}} {{monsieur}} to go to Mr. Delora's room. You need not pass through the sitting-room at all.
