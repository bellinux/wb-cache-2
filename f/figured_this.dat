5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E

500|$|The album {{garnered}} mixed reviews. [...] Billboard {{called the}} album [...] "artfully absurd third-generation rock" [...] {{and the group}} [...] "the first stars of future rock". [...] John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone, writing that it [...] "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers." [...] However, referring to [...] "Black Juju" [...] {{he also said that}} [...] "the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" [...] of the other tracks. [...] Robert Christgau rated it B−, stating that he [...] "never would have <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> theatre type to come up with it" [...] and calling [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] "as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable to hear in this flaccid year, or maybe ever".|$|E
2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the salad bowl at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video. [...] "I was so young and naïve, I just <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> is what they normally do in music videos," [...] recalls Paula Abdul, who eventually became the choreographer.|$|E
2500|$|.....food {{was hidden}} {{and only one}} individual, named Belle, {{in a group of}} {{chimpanzees}} was informed of the location. Belle was eager to lead the group to the food but when one chimpanzee, named Rock, began to refuse to share the food, Belle changed her behaviour. She began to sit on the food until Rock was far away, then she would uncover it quickly and eat it. Rock <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> out though and began to push her {{out of the way and}} take the food from under her. Belle then sat farther and farther away waiting for Rock to look away before she moved towards the food. In an attempt to speed the process up, Rock looked away until Belle began to run for the food. On several occasions he would even walk away, acting disinterested, and then suddenly spin around and run towards Belle just as she uncovered the food." ...|$|E

He later said he <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> probably saved his life. After the war, Brickhill co-wrote Escape to Danger (with Conrad Norton, and original artwork: London: Faber and Faber, 1946). Later Brickhill wrote a larger study and the first major account of the escape in The Great Escape (1950), bringing the incident to a wide public attention. This book became the basis of the film (1963).|$|E
2500|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Roman Republic, years began to be dated by consulships and control over intercalation was granted to the pontifices, who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals' terms of office. Having won his war with Pompey, Caesar used his position as Rome's chief pontiff to enact a calendar reform in 46, coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Rome's religious ceremonies, the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides, even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single leap day on 24 February (a doubled [...] ) every fourth year but following Caesar's assassination the priests <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place, Augustus was obliged to suspend intercalation for a few decades. The revised calendar remaining slightly longer than the solar year, the date of Easter shifted far enough away from the vernal equinox that Pope GregoryXIII ordered its adjustment in the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Inter band {{arguments}} {{about the direction of}} the group between Byrd {{and the rest of his}} band mates led the band to split up within months of the album's release. The United States of America was first released in 1968 on Columbia Records. The album spent nine weeks on the charts in the United States, peaking at number 181 on the Billboard album charts in May 1968. The album failed to chart in Britain. The album was reissued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1992 with two bonus tracks. In 1997, the album was re-issued in the United Kingdom on Edsel Records. On July 13, 2004 Sundazed Records re-issued the album on vinyl and compact disc with a new album cover from the original UK and Europe releases, and with the CD version containing 10 bonus tracks. USA member Joseph Byrd claims to have little input to the Sundazed re-release of the album. [...] Byrd claims he was [...] "interested in doing notes, and I <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> was a chance to get my voice heard - Dorothy and Rubinson had both done extensive interviews referring to me in unpleasant fashion (as justification for their coup, I imagine). I asked for $300 and got it. I've written elsewhere to you that Sundazed took out all references they found controversial, including one about Bill Graham." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some saw {{the case}} as a vindication of the UK's strict libel laws.

A minority of reporters who covered the case were either sympathetic to Irving (for his general career, not for his denial) or non-fans of Lipstadt (one reporter called her boring and said people would not want to hear from her when the trial was concluded); in his book on the trial, Richard C. Evans noted that some articles assumed that Lipstadt was suing Irving even though the plaintiff's name appears first in the court filing and they could have <b>figured</b> <b>this</b> out, and also that Lipstadt was accused of [...] "trying to silence" [...] Irving by launching a defense against Irving's own lawsuit (a lawsuit that would have ended in Lipstadt being silenced in the UK by having her book removed from circulation if Irving had won the case).|$|E
