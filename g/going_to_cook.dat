2500|$|On September 2, 2010, Mayweather {{unleashed}} a profanity-filled racist internet rant against Pacquiao via Ustream. He was misquoted as referring to Pacquiao as [...] "a yellow chump" [...] but he actually {{called him a}} [...] "little young chump" [...] and said, [...] "Once I stomp the midget, I’ll make that queer make me a sushi roll and cook me some rice." [...] In addition, he said, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> that [...] with cats and dogs. Have some rice with a little barbecue dog." [...] The following day Mayweather apologized.

I like an early breakfast, and so I turned out, {{more than an hour}} ago and went to look up Mrs. Perkenpine; and I might as well say, sir, that I am now looking for the bishop to come and help me carry our tent back to our own camp, where he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> for us. I never wanted to be a trespasser on your premises, and I don't intend to be such any longer." ...|$|E

60|$|And Jim {{said you}} mustn't count {{the things you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.|$|E
60|$|Larry obeyed; Old Peter seized and {{operated}} {{on the last}} bird, and Bunco raked the embers of the fire together, while Will Osten looked on and laughed. In a very few minutes the three birds were plucked and cleaned, and Larry, in virtue of his office, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> them, when Will suggested that he had better resign in favour of Bunco, who was doubtless better acquainted than himself with the best modes of forest cookery. To this Larry objected a little at first, but he was finally prevailed on to give in, and Bunco {{went to work in}} his own fashion. It was simple enough. First he cut three short sticks and pointed them at each end, then he split each bird open, and laying it flat, thrust a stick through it, and stuck it up before the glowing fire to roast. When one side was pretty well done he turned the other, and, while that was cooking, cut off a few scraps from the half-roasted side and tried them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] Bertram answered, still placid and unruffled. [...] "There {{were three}} of us who saw him; {{and it was a}} very ignominious {{position}} indeed for a person who sets up to be a great chief in the country. He won't like the little boys on his own estate to know the great Sir Lionel was lifted up against his will, carried about like a baby, and set down in a bracken-bed. Indeed, I was more than sorry to have to do such a thing to a man of his years; but you see he WOULD have it. It's the only way to deal with these tabooing chiefs. You must face them and be done with it. In the Caroline Islands, once, I had to do the same thing to a cazique who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> and eat a very pretty young girl of his own retainers. He wouldn't listen to reason; the law was on his side; so, being happily NOT a law-abiding person myself, I took him up in my arms, and walked off with him bodily, and was obliged to drop him down into a very painful bed of stinging plants like nettles, so as to give myself time to escape with the girl clear out of his clutches. I regretted having to do it so roughly, of course; but there was no other way out of it." ...|$|E
50|$|This year saw {{a change}} in the format of the heats. Instead of only two chefs being present for all the heats for their region, as in {{previous}} years, in this year three chefs compete in the 'courses' section of their heats, with two <b>going</b> forward <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> for the judges in the 'judging' episode. As in series four, a previous participant returned each week, but with the added responsibility of scoring each chef's four courses. The chef with the lowest score {{at the end of the}} 'courses' episodes is eliminated, and the remaining two cook for the judges.|$|R
5000|$|In {{her first}} {{interview}} after the incident, Griggs {{said she had}} received hundreds of emails and disconnected her phone after getting over 100 calls. Though the November issue was scheduled for delivery, Griggs said, [...] "I don't know if I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>Cooks</b> Source. At this point, it's looking doubtful." [...] The article elaborated that Cooks Source commonly received cookbooks and recipes from publishers and that its content was routinely duplicated from those sources, sometimes with express permission. Shortly after the interview's publication, Gaudio was able to confirm Griggs' donation, and therefore considered the matter [...] "all resolved, at least to my satisfaction." ...|$|R

[...] "Mr. Inglis is worth millions, and they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Europe on their wedding tour. When they come back they'll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg. Jane has only one trouble--she can cook so well and her husband won't let her cook. He is so rich he hires his cooking done.

60|$|Having {{been divided}} into watches we {{were sent to}} supper; but I could not eat any thing except a little biscuit, though I should {{have liked to have}} some good tea; but as I had no pot to get it in, and was rather nervous about asking the rough sailors to let me drink out of theirs; I was obliged to go without a sip.

60|$|There is {{a little}} talk about Mr Dombey, but very little.

And reference being made to Mr Perch, he confirms her view of the case. Somebody wonders what he'll do, and whether he'll go out in any situation. Mr Towlinson thinks not, and hints at a refuge {{in one of them}} genteel almshouses of the better kind. 'Ah, where he'll have his little garden, you know,' says Cook plaintively, 'and bring up sweet peas in the spring.' 'Exactly so,' says Mr Towlinson, 'and be one of the Brethren of something or another.' 'We are all brethren,' says Mrs Perch, in a pause of her drink. 'Except the sisters,' says Mr Perch. 'How are the mighty fallen!' remarks Cook. 'Pride shall have a fall, and it always was and will be so!' observes the housemaid.|$|R

5000|$|Co-writer and {{director}} Robert Zemeckis, who has approval over all {{films in the}} Back to the Future franchise, has stated that he will block all attempts to remake or reboot the original film. Bob Gale stated {{that he did not}} wish to see another film in the series without the Marty McFly character nor any other actor than Michael J. Fox playing him, while acknowledging that Fox's current health condition would make this impossible. He illustrated this at a 2008 fan convention in Florida, stating [...] "The idea of making another Back to the Future movie without Michael J. Fox - you know, that's like saying, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> you a steak dinner and I'm going to hold the beef." [...] Gale also said that the Telltale adaptation is the closest thing to what a fourth film could be like. In a USA Today interview on October 21, 2015, the day of Marty McFly's purported arrival in the future, Christopher Lloyd stated that he would consider making a fourth film under the condition that the original cast and creative team returned, along with a story [...] "worth telling." [...] The same day, Lloyd once again reprised his role as Doc Brown in a brief segment in which Doc Brown returns to announce a special message explaining the discrepancy between reality and the [...] "future" [...] as depicted in the film.|$|E
50|$|One day, while Uttai Tawee {{was in her}} frog skin, she was {{captured}} by a poor old man for dinner. He took her home to feed himself and his wife. They were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> her but was interrupted when she started speaking and {{by a group of}} men outside. The old man was an addicted gambler and owed them money, which he couldn't pay. Feeling sorry for the couple, Uttai Tawee told them where to find jewels buried underground to pay for the debts. She made the old man swear that he would quit gambling. She would cook for them and lie about how the food got there. The couple adored her and decided to keep her as a pet. One day, they found her in human form and realized that she was not a frog, but a small child. They were going to destroy the frog skin so she could remain human with them. She caught them and asked them why they are doing that. The couple explained to her that she shouldn't have to wear a frog's skin if she was such a beautiful child. She told them that she wanted to keep the frog's skin, but will remain in human form if they wanted her too. From then on they looked after her as their granddaughter. Uttai Tawee lived with the old couple and visited her forest friends.|$|E

50|$|Box {{has brought}} {{home with him}} a rasher of bacon, which he at once prepares to cook. He lights the fire, is indignant that his matches have been used and his candles burnt low; for, being at home only during the day, he {{suspects}} Mrs Bouncer of these depredations. Leaving his bacon to cook, he retires to bed for a short nap. Cox then returns, having been given the day off by his employer. He has bought a mutton chop and, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> it on the gridiron, finds the fire already lit and the rasher of bacon on the gridiron. He removes it, puts his chop in its stead, and hurries into an adjoining room for a plate. The slamming of the door awakens Box, who, recollecting his bacon, leaps from the bed, and finds the chop where {{he had left the}} rasher. He angrily seizes the chop, flings it from the window, and leaves the room to fetch a plate. Cox re-enters, and, in lieu of his chop, discovers the rasher, which follows the chop out of the window. Box and Cox meet, each imagining the other to be an intruder, each pulling from his pocket the last week's receipt for rent, and each clamouring loudly for redress from the landlady. Mrs Bouncer is forced to explain the mystery, and she throws herself on the kindness of Box and Cox by promising either of them a handsome second floor back room, which she hurries off to prepare.|$|E

40|$|Interactive TV is a {{bit like}} making a meal – so far all we’ve done is the shopping, now we’ve got to find out what we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook.</b> ” Michael Jackson – ex head of Ch 4 TV UK The term 'convergence ' {{increasingly}} dominates discussions of our media environment, yet due to the embryonic nature of the newer interactive media platforms it remains hard to predict patterns of use and meaning making among consumers. As the UK moves into the world of digital plenty leaving behind the comfortable world of analogue scarcity, television executives are increasingly looking to interactivity to woo the promiscuous audience 1. Reality media events stripped across nine discreet platforms, such as Big Brother, are on vanguard of these new initiatives. This article explores some of the implications for user control over content. It uses quantitative and qualitative data from a web-based questionnaire linked to Big Brother's UK Web site (August 2000, July 2001) in order to map expectations associated with different viewing platforms. It examines how these predominantly youth, fan viewers negotiate what I have called a ‘reality contract ’ 2 with the series while ‘surfing ’ between platforms. This mobility I argue, (particularly appealing for ‘reality TV ’ formats) allows the audience to customise their viewing, developing strategies for watching that cater to a sense of authorship and control over the content Key words: Interactivity, viewer positioned as editor, reality tolerances across media platforms; democratisation of media, boxing reality- shelf-life considerations for multi-media reality, redundancy of conventional production practices.
