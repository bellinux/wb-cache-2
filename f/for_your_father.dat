2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. This created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, the couple decided to move to Harmony, where they reconciled—to some extent—with Isaac and Elizabeth Hale. Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us." [...] In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first child—a son named Alvin—who lived only a few hours.|$|E

60|$|There {{are many}} kinds of noble personages amid the blessed company of All Saints, whom I might bid you to {{remember}} this day. Some of you are the sons of statesmen or lawyers.
