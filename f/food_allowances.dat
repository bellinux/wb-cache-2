Together with Socialist Action the Refugee Union activists staged a well-organised and peaceful six-month-long occupation in Central (close to IFC) to demand the government cancels its contract with welfare operator International Social Services (ISS). ISS has attracted massive criticism over its perceived high-handedness and failure to fully meet its contractual obligations in respect of rent and <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> to refugees who are banned from working in Hong Kong. Following a long campaign, the government (Social Welfare Department) made significant concessions to the Refugee Union’s demands in early 2015. These included replacing the widely criticised food parcels with a coupon system. On 29 January 2015, a deadly fire broke out in the New Territories at a former pig farm converted into slum housing for refugees under an ISS-supported programme. Sri Lankan asylum seeker Sivarajah Sivatharan was killed in the fire, a tragedy that reignited debate over the Hong Kong government's cruel policies towards refugees.

5000|$|Cartoons {{were also}} used to criticise NHS policy. From 1948, Zeitlyn also found {{cartoons}} portraying concern about the 'bureaucratic consequences' of the NHS. The number of critical cartoons about NHS policy increased from the 1960s, as the NHS faced cuts, and the satire movement emerged in Britain. In December 1960, cartoonist Victor Weisz drew an image for the Evening Standard showing Minister for Health Enoch Powell as a surgeon covered in blood, accusing him of making too many cuts. [...] Other cartoonists suggested that too much was being spent on the NHS. For example, in the Daily Mail in 1968, John Musgrave-Wood drew a man to portray the NHS, who was wearing a dunce's cap and being fed 'Defence Cuts'. [...] Many cartoons have been very interested in portraying NHS staff, both their lives and industrial conflict. The cartoonist Carl Giles, who often drew for the Daily Express, {{was very interested in}} drawing nurses in particular. Historian Jack Saunders has argued that Giles' presentation shifted from presenting nurses from 'caring and sexualised' to 'bolshie and assertive'.

This threshold is the cost for purchasing recommended daily <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> (RDA) of an adult equivalent for healthy life in rural Nigeria estimated at N 138. Despite the fact that agricultural sector employed over 70 % of the country’s population overwhelmingly large segment of Nigerians especially farming families in rural areas are the most food insecure.

40|$|Protein supplementation {{can improve}} the {{resistance}} to parasites of periparturient ewes, as indicated by reduced nematode egg excretion and worm burdens. However, {{the rate at which}} this improvement can occur is largely unknown. We investigated the rate of improvement by assessing temporal changes in faecal egg counts after we experimentally reduced nutrient demand. Three groups of nine pregnant ewes each were trickle infected with Teladorsagia circumcincta from day(- 70) to day(16) (parturition is day(0)). Two groups of twin-rearing ewes were fed at 0. 8 (L 22) or 1. 2 (H 22) times their assumed metabolizable protein requirements, and a third group was fed the same daily <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> as L 22 ewes, but one of their lambs was removed on day(10) (L 21). Ewes were slaughtered on day(21) to assess worm burdens, in vitro larval establishment on abomasal explants, and mucosal inflammatory cells. Faecal egg counts of L 22 ewes were higher than H 22 ewes throughout lactation. After the removal of one lamb, faecal egg counts of L 21 ewes decreased within 5 days to levels similar to H 22 ewes. Relative to L 22 ewes, L 21 and H 22 ewes had lower worm burdens, parasite per capita fecundity and in vitro establishment rates of both T. circumcincta and Haemonchus contortus. Mucosal mast cell and eosinophil counts were similar for all ewes, but H 22 ewes had higher globule leukocyte counts than L 22 and L 21 ewes. The data Suggest that a reduction in protein demand can rapidly improve periparturient immunity to T. circumcincta. This may be associated with increased parasite expulsion, reduced fecundity and non-parasite specific reduction of in vitro larval establishment. (C) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Body condition score was maintained between two and four on a 5 -point scale by varying <b>food</b> <b>allowances</b> quarterly. The impact of change in body weight (BW) and body composition on longevity was analysed using linear mixed models with random slopes and intercepts. On 31 July 2014, 10  years after study start, dogs were classified into three lifespan groups: 13 (33  %) Expected (≥ 9 to ≤ 12. 9  years), 15 (39  %) Long (≥ 13 to ≤ 15. 5  years) and 11 (28  %) Exceptional (≥ 15. 6  years) with five still alive. Gender and age at neutering were not associated with longevity (P ≥  0. 06). BW increased similarly for all lifespan groups up to age 9, thereafter, from 9 to 13  years, Exceptional dogs gained and Long-lifespan dogs lost weight (P =  0. 007). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer scans revealed that absolute fat mass increase was slower to age 13 for Long compared with Expected lifespan dogs (P =  0. 003) whilst all groups lost a similar amount of absolute lean mass (P >  0. 05). Percent fat increase and percent lean loss were slower, whilst the change in fat:lean was smaller, in both the Exceptional and Long lifespan compared with Expected dogs to age 13 (P ≤  0. 02). Total bone mineral density was significantly lower for Expected compared to Exceptional and Long lifespan dogs (P <  0. 04). This study shows that life-long maintenance of lean body mass and attenuated accumulation of body fat were key factors in achieving a longer lifespan. The results suggest that a combination of a high quality plane of nutrition with appropriate husbandry and healthcare are important in obtaining a greater than expected proportion of Labrador retrievers living well beyond that of the expected breed lifespan: 89. 7  % (95  % CI 74. 8 - 96. 7  %) dogs were alive at 12  years of age and 28. 2  % (95  % CI 15. 6 - 45. 1  %) reaching an exceptional lifespan of ≥ 15. 6  years...|$|E
