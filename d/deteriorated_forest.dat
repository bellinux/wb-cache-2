40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{report the}} {{relationship}} of vegetation structure and environmental gradient and physiochemical properties of soil at Nikyal valley, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. MethodsA survey of natural vegetation and soil of Nikyal valley was undertaken. Phytosociological survey was conducted by using Braun-Blanquet's approach. The study also investigated the vegetation structure and its relationship with altitude and edaphic factors. The floristic data was analyzed by cluster anlaysis, detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using CANACOO 5. 0. ResultsA total of 110 plant species and 13 stands were merged into five major associations as dema rcated by cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. The associations were Olea-Pinus–Themeda association, Myrsine-Rhus-Quercus association, Quercus-Rubus-Pinus association and Quercus association. Soil organic matter, saturation, pH and altitude play the major role in distribution of species. ConclusionsThe variation in vegetation structure {{is controlled by the}} altitudinal gradient and physiochemical properties of soil. These results indicate a <b>deteriorated</b> <b>forest</b> structure and reduced regeneration pattern, demanding immediate attention of forest management authorities...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, the political, economic, societal and ecological situation in Europe is undergoing rapid change. Forestry is inclu-ded in these developments. European foresters face the challenge of re-consi-dering the principles of forestry, formulating a European forestry policy and reshaping the forestry sector in certain European countries. The new paradigm of the future European forestry will be based on two principles: sustainability and multifunctionality, which, integrated and co-ordinated, will give rise to a modern system of forest management that will be economically feasible, eco-logically sound and will fully cover the needs of contemporary society. A ge-neral assumption is that sustainable and multifunctional forestry can best be achieved by a close-to-nature management system; it is believed that this form of management best complies with the above principles. The change in the scope of European forestry has direct consequences for forest research. To support developments, new scientific information is neces-sary. From the ecological point of view the following main research fields deserve particular attention: global change and its impact on forests, including CO 2 sequestration; forest ecosystem functioning and natural forest dynamics; the ecological functions of forests in a broader landscape context, in relation to biodiversity protection and nature conservation; the ecological risks, both natural and anthropogenic; and the restoration of <b>deteriorated</b> <b>forests</b> and sites. In certain European countries the above-mentioned change in the scope of forest management and research is already under way.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a spatial evaluation of forest biomass usage using a {{geographic information system}} (GIS) for the Japanese town of Yusuhara. In Japan, over 60 % {{of the land is}} covered with forest, of which at least 40 % is artificial forest. However, because of high labor costs, the profitability of forestry is decreasing, so timber cultivation is not done {{to the extent that it}} could be, and thinning has to be subsidized. Under these circumstances, much of the <b>forest</b> is <b>deteriorating.</b> Most of the thinning is accounted for by throwaway thinning, in which the resulting wood is not used. However, with the steep rise in oil prices and the intensification of global warming concerns, expectations are rising for the use of biomass energy from thinned timber that has previously been discarded. If thinned timber, logging residues, and offcuts are utilized for biomass energy and their economic value becomes apparent, profitability will improve for both final cutting and thinning. And in addition to forestry activities being invigorated, it will be possible for some of the <b>deteriorating</b> <b>forests</b> (which have associated dangers such as landslides) to recover. However, using thinned timber and logging residues is problematic in that profitability is affected by harvesting costs. Harvesting costs are largely determined by geographic factors and are higher for more distant stands. Accordingly, in this article, operational costs for different stands are calculated using GIS and matched with total demand in the subject region. In addition, stands with lower operational costs are identified and an investigation of a highly feasible use of forest biomass is carried out.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} impact of household-level risk (e. g. sickness and loss of assets) and community-level risk (e. g. natural disasters and outside intrusion) on rural livelihoods and forest conditions in developing countries, and the roles of collective action and property rights in risk management. Forests support the livelihoods of many rural people and act as safety nets during times of adversity. Forest users constantly encounter risk, and managing risk requires them to employ different livelihood and coping strategies based on their unique household situations. Their chosen strategies lead to varying degrees of dependency on the forests and may contribute to <b>deteriorating</b> <b>forest</b> conditions. With degrading forest conditions, users {{may no longer be}} able to rely on forests for subsistence and as insurance against future risk. These interrelationships among risk, forest users, and their resources motivate my field studies, which I conducted in Bolivia, where land reforms have given local communities more extensive user rights to their forest resources. Using household surveys and forest plot data from indigenous communities, I find that households that are considered vulnerable to community-level risk are not more prone to household-level risk, and they have various coping strategy options for dealing with risk. These are households that are headed by women or the elderly, have many dependents, and are poor. Furthermore, market exposure and past failures of collective actions hinder community members 2 ̆ 7 ability to manage risks collectively. Also, the evolving environment changes the livelihood strategies and the types of risk forest users are exposed to. Therefore, many forest users have diversified their income sources and coping strategy options. Finally, forest users who have fewer coping strategy options support common property rights. These users reported fewer conflicts with other community members and engage in more forest management activities. These findings deepen our understanding of the complexity of coupled human-natural systems by exploring the relationships among forest users, their reliance on forests, and the risks they encounter. The results offer insights that can enhance policymaking in community risk management by broadening programs 2 ̆ 7 coverage to assist households with diverse characteristics and promoting non-forest-based coping strategy options...|$|R

This study assesses {{the extent to which}} medicinal plants bring benefits in biodiversity management and improve livelihood and healthcare in indigenous villages near a small city, a second tier city in the central Peruvian Amazon, taking into consideration the course of urbanization. A total of 81 people living in two villages were interviewed.

Therefore, the local utilization of medicinal plants does not <b>deteriorate</b> the <b>forest</b> resources, thus medicinal plants would not be expected to be a driver for biodiversity management. Although medicinal plants still support healthcare of the locals, the reliance on modern medicine is aparent. The distance to the urbanized city and modern facilities influences the use of medicinal plants.

30|$|Amidst growing {{environmental}} {{consciousness and}} increasing demand for timber products, {{the importance of}} fulfilling growing demand for these products on the one hand, {{and at the same}} minimizing environmental impacts, is increasingly recognized. While FAO (2001) had predicted {{that by the end of}} 2020, global consumption of industrial timber products will increase by 45 %, UK based sustainable real estate organization FIM, based on existing growth levels, has forecasted that global timber consumption in 2020 will be 2.3 billion cubic meters.

Moreover, The World Bank has also forecasted that global timber demand is set to quadruple by 2050 (FIM 2017). As a result, there is growing concern about fulfilling the need for increasing demand for timber products without <b>deteriorating</b> the world’s <b>forest</b> resources. Hence, enhanced insight is required into ways of improving the efficiency of timber production process, reducing wood wastage and helping the timber sector to address growing environmental challenges (Eshun et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} involved post-colonial (∼ 85 years old), {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Engelm.) growing at ∼ 2, 255 m in northern Arizona {{an area that}} historically experienced a wildfire event every 5 - 20 years. Such fires were typically limited to surface fuels and thus seldom effected stand replacement. However, since the settlement of European peoples in approximately the 18802 ̆ 7 s fire cycles have been dramatically altered by the systematic suppression of all wildland fire. This change greatly increased seedling survivorship, and {{has resulted in a}} forest with historically unprecedented stem densities. Under current conditions, with individual trees receiving insufficient nourishment, many ponderosa pine forests have demonstrated stagnated growth and increased risk of pathogenic attack or catastrophic wildfire. ^ In response to <b>deteriorating</b> <b>forest</b> conditions and the building threat of wildfire many forest managers are exploring methods of reestablishing natural cycles to restore historical stand dynamics. Typically this effort has included timber harvesting and/or the use of prescribed fire. In this application timber harvesting typically involves removing the younger cohort of post-settlement trees. While the objectives of prescribed fire are similar to timber harvesting, fire is by its nature less precise; treatment can not be limited to a target demographic. As a result, the application of prescribed fire can lead to different stand conditions than tree removal. It is also common (especially under extreme stem densities) to have a timbering operation precede a fire treatment. The impact of these three scenarios on residual ponderosa pine tree reserves is not well understood. ^ This project has taken part in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service and the national Fire and Fire Surrogate task group. The experiment was arranged with a 2 x 2 factorial design which resulted in four treatments. Plots were either timber harvested, burned with prescribed fire, cut than burned, or left untreated with treatment application occurring in 2002 - 03, three years prior to initial sampling. Trees were sampled with one of two methods. Initially a randomly selected coarse lateral root was mechanically exposed for three meters; roughly the average canopy drip line radius whereupon root tissue was extracted at intervals starting at the root collar. This disruptive method was eventually replaced by limiting sampling to the root collar. To slow metabolic activity root tissue samples were field chilled before being oven dried. Dried samples were ground through a 40 # mesh and then triple-extracted with ethanol for carbohydrate quantification with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Carbohydrate samples were processed at the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Experiment Station in Wareham MA. with an ion exchange column and a refractive index detector using water as a mobile phase. Starch quantifications were conducted on sub-samples by Cumberland Valley Analytical Services INC. (Maugansville, MD.) using an alpha-amylase digestion and color metric evaluation on an Astoria auto analyzer. ^ As a result of this project it was determined that the ponderosa pine root non-structural carbohydrate components are sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose and starch. Reserve concentrations of soluble (EtOH) carbohydrates declined significantly between May and August on plots that were not treated with prescribed fire, burning eliminated this seasonal difference. Starch and total non-structural carbohydrates were also found to be lower in August (compared to May) suggesting that during the summer (May–August), ponderosa pine must draw upon reserves. It was also found that carbohydrate concentrations increased significantly with distance from the root collar. When sampled on a monthly basis it was determined that carbohydrates, both individually and collectively, were significantly affected by the month of sampling and that overall timber harvesting reduced total soluble (EtOH) sugar concentrations. It is believed that collectively carbohydrate concentrations were a reflection of the bi-modal precipitation pattern of northern Arizona; spring snow-melt in particular, appears to have significant increased stored reserves. ^ Key Words: Pinus ponderosa, prescribed fire, restoration, Southwest, thinning...|$|R

30|$|Perhaps {{the oldest}} {{way to resolve}} the tension between {{conservation}} targets and human interests is the so called ‘Yellowstone model’ or ‘fences and fines’ approach. It encompasses conservation measures by prohibitions, top-down policy control and fines, and even the very separation of human culture and society from conservation areas by fencing (Spence 1999; cf. Rytteri and Puhakka 2009). In Finnish reindeer discourses, not only the enclosure of reindeer outside certain areas, such as private forests, fields and conservation areas but also {{the ending of the}} free grazing right and the transformation of reindeer herding to farming {{have a long history of}} being discussed. Recently, the cessation of free grazing rights has been justified by references to, for example, the avoidance of traffic accidents, overgrazing problems and for nurturing larger, great beast populations (cf. Heikkinen 2002; Jokinen 2005; Rantamäki-Lahtinen 2008). Here reindeer herders are seen more strongly as users of ecosystem services, and an idea in conservation is that reindeer herders should not be allowed to <b>deteriorate</b> the <b>forest</b> floor and regional biodiversity. In addition, suggestions have been made for reintroducing wild forest reindeer to the area. There are reflections of this kind of trend in PAN Parks' recommendations to decrease the density of reindeer close to the hypothetical density of wild forest reindeer (Zinke et al. 2002, Stritih et al. 2007, PAN Parks 2010; Heikkinen et al. 2010; Sarkki et al.In press). An increase in predator numbers also results in difficulties for continuing free grazing reindeer herding. The number of wolves in Finland has also been debated between EU and Finland, as EU claimed in 2005 that Finland was violating the conservation targets of EU's habitat directive. After intense debate, the appeal was closed in 2008 when the European Commission finally stated that Finland has not threatened the sustainable level of its wolf population (Heikkinen et al. 2011; Hiedanpää and Bromley 2011). However, this debate stresses that international conservation pressures exist for increased predator conservation.|$|R
