25|$|The term {{modality}} {{means the}} chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language {{is that it}} is modality-independent. Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its <b>innate</b> <b>capacity</b> to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission. From this it appears that the language centres of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally irrespective of the selected modality.|$|E
25|$|Stimuli {{that are}} {{directly}} attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central {{point of the}} retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of {{the left and right}} eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an <b>innate</b> <b>capacity</b> that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.|$|E

Unlike many of his Manchester contemporaries, Gaskell always favoured social and educational work above political lobbying for free trade or factory reform.

60|$|Most of {{the facts}} {{hitherto}} given have served to illustrate the force of inheritance, but we must now consider cases grouped {{as well as the}} subject allows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or deficient the power of inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity first appears, we can never predict whether it will be inherited. If both parents from their birth present the same peculiarity, the probability is strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring. We have seen that variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed, taken from a branch which had become variegated through bud-variation, than from plants which were variegated as seedlings. With most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on some <b>innate</b> <b>capacity</b> in the individual: thus Vilmorin (12/37. Verlot 'La Product. des Varietes' 1865 page 32.) raised from a peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings, which all resembled their parent; but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new character, whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during several successive generations. So again with a variety of the rose, two plants alone out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the desired character; numerous analogous cases could be given.|$|E

In so doing and arguing largely – but not exclusively – from within the stance of social-constructivism, it is suggested that accounts of gift-development that emphasise the role of <b>innate</b> <b>capacities</b> lead frequently to tired debates around identification, labelling and resourcing, and away from the more vital discourses around gifted provision and gift-creation. The implications for classroom practice deriving from traditional and emerging ontological and epistemological conceptualisations of giftedness are presented...|$|R

It proposes that learners will benefit from their L 1 bidialectal knowledge in second language (L 2) learning, since L 1 bidialectals exhibit better syntactic awareness of L 2 specific structures. It further argues that mechanism of association, rather than rule computation, plays a more important role in L 2 acquisition...|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{fortunately}} for the world, Darwin's own mind was essentially one of the inductive type. If a great deductive thinker and speculator like Herbert Spencer had hit upon the self-same idea of survival of the fittest, he might have communicated it to a small following of receptive disciples, who would have understood it and accepted it, on a priori grounds alone, and gradually {{passed it on to}} the grades beneath them; but he would never have touched the slow and cautious elephantine intellect of the masses. The common run of mankind are not deductive; they require to have everything made quite clear to them by example and instance. The English intelligence in particular shows itself as a rule congenitally incapable of appreciating the superior logical certitude of the deductive method. Englishmen will not even believe that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the containing sides until they have measured and weighed as well as they are able by rude experimental devices a few selected pieces of rudely shaped rectangular paper. It was a great gain, therefore, that the task of reconstructing the course of organic evolution should fall to the lot of a highly trained and masterly intelligence of the inductive order. Darwin had first to convince himself, and then he could proceed to convince the world. He set about the task with characteristic patience and thoroughness. No man that ever lived possessed in a more remarkable degree than he did the <b>innate</b> <b>capacity</b> for taking trouble. For five years, as a mere preliminary, he accumulated facts in immense variety, and then {{for the first time and}} in the vaguest possible way he--'allowed himself to speculate.' That brings us down to the year 1842, when the first notes of the 'Origin of Species' must have been tentatively committed to paper. It was in 1859 that the first edition of the complete work was given to the world. Compare this with the case of Newton, who similarly kept his grand idea of gravitation for many years in embryo, until more exact measurements of the moon's mass and distance should enable him to verify it to his own satisfaction.|$|E

M. de Bassompierre did not well know me, but I knew him, and honoured and admired his nature, with all its plain sincerity, its warm affection, and unconscious enthusiasm. Possibly I might have spoken, but just then Graham turned; he turned with one of his stately firm movements, so different from those, of a sharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him a throng, a hundred ranks deep; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide its scrutiny--why then did he concentrate all on me--oppressing me with the whole force of that full, blue, steadfast orb? Why, if he would look, did not one glance satisfy him? why did he turn on his chair, rest his elbow on its back, and study me leisurely? He could not see my face, I held it down; surely, he could not recognise me: I stooped, I turned, I would not be known. He rose, by some means he contrived to approach, in two minutes he would have had my secret: my identity would have been grasped between his, never tyrannous, but always powerful hands. There was but one way to evade or to check him. I implied, by a sort of supplicatory gesture, that it was my prayer to be let alone; after that, had he persisted, he would perhaps have seen the spectacle of Lucy incensed: not all that was grand, or good, or kind in him (and Lucy felt the full amount) should have kept her quite tame, or absolutely inoffensive and shadowlike. He looked, but he desisted. He shook his handsome head, but he was mute. He resumed his seat, nor did he again turn or disturb me by a glance, except indeed for one single instant, when a look, rather solicitous than curious, stole my way--speaking what somehow stilled my heart like [...] "the south-wind quieting the earth." [...] Graham's thoughts of me were not entirely those of a frozen indifference, after all. I believe in that goodly mansion, his heart, he kept one little place under the sky-lights where Lucy might have entertainment, if she chose to call. It was not so handsome as the chambers where he lodged his male friends; it was not like the hall where he accommodated his philanthropy, or the library where he treasured his science, still less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was splendidly spread; yet, gradually, by long and equal kindness, he proved to me that he kept one little closet, over the door of which was written [...] "Lucy's Room." [...] I kept a place for him, too--a place of which I never took the measure, either by rule or compass: I think it was like the tent of Peri-Banou. All my life long I carried it folded in the hollow of my hand yet, released from that hold and constriction, I know not but its <b>innate</b> <b>capacity</b> for expanse might have magnified it into a tabernacle for a host.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that proinflammatory factors {{may play a}} role in tumor growth and metastasis, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. However, most evidence originates from animal models, only few human studies reported an association between proinflammatory cytokines and death from cancer. Here, we investigated the association between circulating levels and <b>innate</b> production <b>capacity</b> of proinflammatory cytokines and cancer incidence and mortality in the PROspective Study on Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Experimental Design: Circulating levels of interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and C-reactive protein were measured in all 5, 804 participants of the PROSPER study. The <b>innate</b> production <b>capacity</b> of IL- 6, IL- 1 β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were measured in a random sample of 403 subjects. Results: We showed that high circulating inflammatory markers were associated with an increased risk for cancer incidence and death from cancer during follow-up (all P &# 60; 0. 05). Moreover, high innate proinflammatory cytokine production capacity is associated with an increased risk for death from cancer (all P &# 60; 0. 04) but not with higher cancer incidence during follow-up (all P &# 62; 0. 6). Conclusions: High <b>innate</b> production <b>capacity</b> of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with an increased risk for death from cancer, probably because of increased tumor growth and metastasis. Because there was no association between <b>innate</b> production <b>capacity</b> and cancer incidence, the association between circulating levels and cancer incidence at least partially reflects reversed causality...|$|R
50|$|Heinz Hartmann (1939/1958) {{believed}} the ego included <b>innate</b> <b>capacities</b> that facilitated an individual's {{ability to adapt}} {{to his or her}} environment. These included perception, attention, memory, concentration, motor coordination, and language. Under normal conditions, what Hartmann called an average expectable environment, these capacities developed into ego functions and had autonomy from the libidinal and aggressive drives; that is, they were not products of frustration and conflict, as Freud (1911) believed. Hartmann recognized, however, that conflicts were part of the human condition and certain ego functions may become conflicted by aggressive and libidinal impulses, as witnessed by conversion disorders (e.g., glove paralysis), speech impediments, eating disorders, and attention-deficit disorder.|$|R
