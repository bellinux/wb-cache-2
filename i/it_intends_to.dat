5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{informed}} the FCC {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company's MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered satellites of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV programming to a digital subchannel of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM's subchannel instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV's license and move its ABC affiliation and programming to WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations <b>it</b> <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> surrender. Sinclair was able to retain WBMA-LD in any event as the FCC does not impose any ownership limits on low-power stations.|$|E

5|$|The {{recession}} of 1969-1970 greatly affected Boeing. For {{the year and}} a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies (and later the 767 and A300/A310 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with Northwest Airlines, although <b>it</b> <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> retire them from service by 2018.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, <b>it</b> <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E
