Check valves serve to limit the flow of a fluid to one direction through a channel. This project was an attempt to manufacture an efficient check microvalve using polysilicon as the valve cover material. Previous work on a microvalve at RIT has been unsuccessful, as the final KOH etch has attacked the polysilicon, thus removing the valves from the openings in the silicon. It was determined that pinholes in the LPCVD nitride were allowing KOH to penetrate the etch mask and attack the substrate surface and the polysilicon. In this attempt, black wax was used as a protective coating over the LPCVD nitride on the cover side of the substrate. A crucial part of this project was the testing of the produced microvalves. In this project, nine valve designs were patterned; with each valve differing in arm length and flap overlap across the substrate opening. Of these, one valve functioned correctly after processing.

40|$|Air {{abrasion}} {{process is}} used for cleaning casting surface of prosthetic components, and to prepare the surface of these elements {{for the application of}} veneering items. Its side effect, however, is that abrasive particles are embedded in the treated surface, which can be up to 30 % of the surface and it constitutes the side effect of this procedure. Such a significant participation of foreign material can not be indifferent to the properties of the surface. Embedded particles can be the place of stress concentration causing cracking of ceramics, and may deteriorate corrosion resistance by forming corrosive microlinks. In the latter cases, it would be advisable to remove elements embedded into the surface. The simplest method is chemical etching or electrochemical one. Nevertheless, these procedures should not significantly change the parameters of the surface. Among many possible reagents only a few fulfills all the above conditions.

The study presented results of corrosion resistance of titanium used to make prosthetic components by means of casting method, which were subjected to chemical processing designed to remove the embedded abrasive particles.

Termiskt skift av det optiska transmissionsspektrat orsakat av porositet undersöktes. Analyser av tunnfilmerna med ellipsometri, profilometri och transmissions spektroskopi utfördes. Våtetsningsegenskaperna utvärderades genom att mäta in-situ vid etsprocessen på transparenta borosilikatglassubstrat. Metoden för att mäta etshastigheten för olika oxider är beskriven. Datorberäkningar av pourbaixdiagram användes för att skapa en förståelse av de kemiska egenskaperna för etslösningarna. Etsegenskaperna påverkas till stordel av lösningens pH. TiO 2 kan etsas i basisk lösning av peroxid. Denna process utvärderades, likaså utvärderades etshasigheten för Y 2 O 3 och SiO 2 för att erhålla matchande par avoxider som en fallstudie. Grupp IVB oxiderna är mycket svåra att etsa. Katalytisk etsning av TiO 2 med peroxid är detekterbar men långsam. Al 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3 och MgO är förhållandevis enkla att etsa men har för låga brytningsindex för att var praktiskt använbara i optiska multilagerfilter. In-situ etsinstrumentet befanns vara ett utmärkt verktyg för att mäta etshastigheten för tunnfilmer...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} of porous GaNnanostructures using UV-assisted electroless etching of bulk GaN layer grown on c-plane sapphire substrate {{in a solution}} consisting of HF:CH 3 OH:H 2 O 2. The morphology of the porous GaNnanostructures was characterized for different etching intervals using high resolution scanning electron microscopy. The geometry and size of resultant pores {{do not appear to}} be affected by the etching time; however, the pore density was augmented for longer <b>etching</b> time. Micro-indentation <b>tests</b> were carried out to quantify the indentation modulus for different porous GaNnanostructures. Our results reveal a relationship between the elastic properties and the porosity kinetics, i. e., a decrease of the elastic modulus was observed with increasing porosity. The photoluminescence(PL) and Raman measurements carried out at room temperature for the etched samples having a high degree of porosity revealed a strong enhancement in intensity. Also, the peak of the PL wavelength was shifted towards a lower energy. The high intensity of PL was correlated to an increase of scattered photons within the porous media and to the reduction of the dislocation density...|$|R
40|$|For CdTe {{solar cells}} copper {{seems to be}} {{necessary}} to achieve best energy conversion efficiencies, whilst it {{is known to be}} the main reason of cell performance degradation due to its tendency to diffuse through the bulk. Some studies have shown a direct connection between defect concentration and copper, but little has been discussed about its relation to the CdTe etching. Within this study many samples with Cu/Au back-contact have been prepared with different <b>etching</b> times and <b>tested</b> applying thermal, luminous and electrical stresses. We have analyzed the aging effects on the cell performance and on the nature and concentration of the defects by means of a variety of characterization techniques, like atomic force microscopy, Raman, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, drive level capacitance profiling and admittance spectroscopies. Results of the accelerated lifetime tests show that different performance degradation is observed for cells with differently etched absorber. Solar cells made with optimized etching have very low degradation while the strongest performance reduction is detected for unetched cells despite their initial efficiency is as high as for the case of etched absorbers...|$|R
40|$|Forty-eight subsize round-bar tensile samples (ASTM E 8) were {{machined}} from 3 -in-thick forgings of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Half {{of these}} samples were cut so the axis {{aligned with the}} longitudinal (LG) direction of the forging, the other half were cut to align with the transverse (LT) direction. Four samples from each direction were subjected to one of six heat treatments so that a total of eight samples received each treatment. Annealed samples were held at 1350 °F for two hours, then air cooled. Solution treated and aged (STA) samples were solution treated at one of five temperatures between 1785 °F and 1435 °F for one hour and then water quenched after a 25 second quench delay in air. Following quenching, all STA samples were aged for 6 hours at 990 °F, then air cooled. Prior to tensile testing, the samples were sent back to Weber Metals for chemical milling to remove the brittle alpha-case surface layer formed during heat treatment. A polymer coating {{was applied to the}} samples’ threaded ends so only the gage length would be milled, and any oxide present was sanded off to avoid preferential <b>etching.</b> Tensile <b>tests</b> showed anisotropy primarily in Tensile strength with the LT direction testing 3 - 7 ksi higher than the LG direction. A general linear model found a significant difference of Tensile strengths between directions in all heat treatments except for STA 1, which had the highest solution treating temperature. A difference of about 7 ksi was also found between STA 5 samples in Yield strength. No anisotropy was observed in Elongation. It was concluded that higher solution-treating temperatures decreased anisotropy by transforming the textured alpha into beta, effectively erasing any alignment. It was also concluded that the LT direction is stronger than the LG due to non-preferred slip systems being the primary mechanism of deformation...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{transistor}} technology holds {{great promise}} {{for creating a}} conformal, human-safe electronic neural interface. These interfaces must amplify the low, microvolt-range brain signals {{so they can be}} utilized in analog and digital applications. Brain signals from sensors must be relayed to the transistor’s gate through the dielectric and semiconductor layers, as well as through an encapsulant which keeps the device shielded in the aqueous brain environment. In order to test their amplification gains, silicon wafer-based ambipolar organic transistors with a pentacene semiconductor were tested under nitrogen in amplifying configurations including common source and cascode. Gains for common source amplifiers with resistors were up to 3. 5 V/V. Gains for the cascode setup revealed the same results as common source. Both the common source and cascode topologies exhibited very low bandwidth with- 3 dB points of 35 and 25 hertz, respectively. Parylene C, a biologically safe polymer, is a leading candidate to encapsulate pentacene transistors and serve as a dielectric layer between the devices and sensing electrodes. We <b>tested</b> <b>etching</b> of this parylene as well as the dielectric materials benzocyclobutene (BCB) and spin-on-glass (SoG) using both oxygen and SF 6 plasma etching...|$|R
