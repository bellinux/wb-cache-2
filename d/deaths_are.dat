5|$|People with {{epilepsy}} are at {{an increased}} risk of death. This increase is between 1.6 and 4.1 fold greater than that of the general population and is often related to: the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy. The cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy related deaths. It is unclear how to decrease its risk. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> possibly preventable. In the developing world, many <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.|$|E
5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E

5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors. Findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary {{based on such}} factors as which grades of severity are included, whether <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> included, whether the study is restricted to hospitalized people, and the study's location. The annual {{incidence of}} mild TBI {{is difficult to determine}} but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During {{the same time}} period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan. Details of several confiscations from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan have been reported by the IPPL, including one event on 2May 2007, where 40slow lorises were confiscated at Narita Airport only {{a month before the}} CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of those animals died. The <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose <b>deaths</b> <b>are</b> announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
