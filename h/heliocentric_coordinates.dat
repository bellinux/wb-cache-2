40|$|The {{cosmic dust}} {{analyzer}} aboard the Cassini spacecraft includes a charge and velocity detector which senses electric charges > 10 (- 15) C of individual cosmic dust grains {{as they enter}} the instrument. Charge is an important property of each grain, because it affects its orbital dynamics and is a measure of its size. The duration and shape of the charge signal are also important, because they reveal the grain's location and velocity relative to the spacecraft. The velocity, in turn, can be expressed in a <b>heliocentric</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and orbital parameters can be derived and aid in the identification of the grain's origin. We describe the operation of the charge and velocity detector, present results of laboratory calibrations using charged hypervelocity dust particles, show the first dust charge signal obtained from interplanetary space, and discuss potential applications of an advanced charge detector for future space missions.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{stochastic}} {{model of the}} galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles transport in the heliosphere. Based on {{the solution of the}} Parker transport equation we developed models of the short-time variation of the GCR intensity, i. e. the Forbush decrease (Fd) and the 27 -day variation of the GCR intensity. Parker transport equation being the Fokker-Planck type equation delineates non-stationary transport of charged particles in the turbulent medium. The presented approach of the numerical solution is grounded on solving of the set of equivalent stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We demonstrate the method of deriving from Parker transport equation the corresponding SDEs in the <b>heliocentric</b> spherical <b>coordinate</b> system for the backward approach. Features indicative the preeminence of the backward approach over the forward is stressed. We compare the outcomes of the stochastic model of the Fd and 27 -day variation of the GCR intensity with our former models established by the finite difference method.

We considered analogous displays under controlled circumstances by using as input medium a simulation of the same complete (l,b,v) data cube corresponding to a modeled HI Galaxy of known morphology and kinematics. By varying this artificial input we were able to check our method of converting the data cube and to put constraints on the global parameters that have been used to explain different asymmetries in the heliocentric data.

40|$|We {{present the}} newly {{developed}} stochastic {{model of the}} galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles transport in the heliosphere. Mathematically Parker transport equation (PTE) describing non-stationary transport of charged particles in the turbulent medium is the Fokker-Planck type. It is the second order parabolic time-dependent 4 -dimensional (3 spatial coordinates and particles energy/rigidity) partial differential equation. It is worth to mention that, if we assume the stationary case it remains as the 3 -D parabolic type problem {{with respect to the}} particles rigidity R. If we fix the energy it still remains as the 3 -D parabolic type problem with respect to time. The proposed method of numerical solution is based on the solution of the system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) being equivalent to the Parker's transport equation. We present the method of deriving from PTE the equivalent SDEs in the <b>heliocentric</b> spherical <b>coordinate</b> system for the backward approach. The obtained stochastic model of the Forbush decrease of the GCR intensity is in an agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{observational}} detection of radial and azimuthal oscillations in full halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs). We analyze nine HCMEs well-observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) from 2011 February to June. Using the LASCO C 3 running difference images, we estimated the instantaneous apparent speeds of the HCMEs in different radial directions from the solar disk center. We {{find that the}} development of all these HCMEs is accompanied by quasi-periodic variations of the instantaneous radial velocity with the periods ranging from 24 to 48 minutes. The amplitudes of the instant speed variations reach about a half of the projected speeds. The amplitudes are found to anti-correlate with the periods and correlate with the HCME speed, indicating the nonlinear nature of the process. The oscillations have a clear azimuthal structure in the <b>heliocentric</b> polar <b>coordinate</b> system. The oscillations in seven events are found to be associated with distinct azimuthal wave modes with the azimuthal wave number m = 1 for six events and m = 2 for one event. The polarization of the oscillations in these seven HCMEs is broadly consistent with those of their position angles with the mean difference of 43 °. The oscillations may be connected with natural oscillations of the plasmoids around a dynamical equilibrium, or self-oscillatory processes, e. g., the periodic shedding of Alfvénic vortices. Our results indicate the need for an advanced theory of oscillatory processes in coronal mass ejections...|$|R

Splitting methods satisfying such (generalized) order conditions are appropriate in particular for the numerical simulation of the Solar System described in Jacobi coordinates. We show that, when using Poincaré <b>Heliocentric</b> <b>coordinates,</b> the same order of accuracy may be obtained by imposing an additional polynomial equation on the coefficients of the splitting method.

40|$|We {{observe the}} {{anisotropy}} {{of the power}} spectral tensor of magnetic field fluctuations in the fast solar wind for the first time. In <b>heliocentric</b> RTN <b>coordinates</b> the power in each element of the tensor has a unique dependence on the angle between the magnetic field and velocity of the solar wind (θ) and {{the angle of the}} vector in the plane perpendicular to the velocity (ϕ). We derive the geometrical effect of the high speed flow of the solar wind past the spacecraft on the power spectrum in the frame of the plasma P(k) to arrive at the observed power spectrum P(f,θ,ϕ) based on a scalar field description of turbulence theory. This allows us to predict the variation in the ϕ direction and compare it to the data. We then transform the observations from RTN coordinates to magnetic-field-aligned coordinates. The observed reduced power spectral tensor matches the theoretical predictions we derive in both RTN and field-aligned coordinates which means that the local magnetic field we calculate with wavelet envelope functions is an accurate representation of the physical axis of symmetry for the turbulence and implies that on average the turbulence is axi-symmetric. We also show that we can separate the dominant toroidal component of the turbulence from the smaller but significant poloidal component and that these have different power anisotropy. We also conclude that the magnetic helicity is anisotropic and mostly two-dimensional, arising from wavevectors largely confined to the plane perpendicular to B.

40|$|SUNTRACKER computes the azimuth and {{elevation}} {{angles of}} the sun over a user defined period of time for a given position on the moon. The program gets the selenographic (moon centered) position {{of the sun}} at a given Julian date, then converts the selenographic position of the sun into azimuth and elevation at a given position on the moon. The selenographic coordinate system {{is based on the}} equatorial plane of the moon. The origin of this system is referenced to the mean center of the apparent lunar disk. This is the point of the surface of the moon intersected by the lunar radius directed towards the center of the earth when the moon is at its mean ascending node. Selenographic longitudes are measured positive in the direction towards Mare Crisium from the lunar meridian passing through the origin. Selenographic latitudes are measured positive towards the northern hemisphere containing Mare Serenitatis, from the lunar equator. The selenographic co-longitude is obtained by subtracting the selenographic longitude from either 90 or 450 degrees. SUNTRACKER performs two main operations. The first handles the Julian and calendar date calculations. The second operation calculates the right ascension and declination of the sun and moon on the Earth's equatorial coordinate system from the adjusted Julian date. These coordinates are then transferred into the ecliptic coordinate system. From here the moon's position is configured to the <b>heliocentric</b> ecliptic <b>coordinate</b> system. It is from this system that the sun's selenographic position is determined. Algorithms are then used to compute both the physical and optical librations of the moon's motion. The limitations, restrictions and assumptions for SUNTRACKER are as follows: 1) The orbital elements used in this program do not account for nutation, aberration and precession. 2) The selenographic coordinates computed by this program are based on the 1961 Astronomical Ephemeris algorithms. In 1981, a new analytic theory on the librations of the moon was adopted by The Astronomical Almanac. This improved the method of calculating selenographic coordinates. The selenographic coordinates computed by SUNTRACKER are identical to the pre- 1981 Astronomical Almanac values. A comparison between the program's values and the 1993 Astronomical Almanac's values found the maximum deviations in longitude and latitude to be. 030 deg. and. 034 deg. respectively. The average deviations were. 013 deg. in selenographic co-longitude and. 017 deg. in selenographic latitude. SUNTRACKER is written in FORTRAN 77 for IBM PC compatible computers running MS-DOS.
