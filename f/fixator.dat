25|$|King was {{conscious}} {{enough to give}} the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external <b>fixator.</b> After five operations in ten days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable.|$|E
25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural process that will occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external <b>fixator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|External fixation, {{which can}} be used with either open or closed {{reduction}} uses a pin system, where long screws are passed through the skin and into either side of a fracture segment (typically 2 pins per side) then secured in place using an external <b>fixator.</b> [...] This is a more common approach when the bone is heavily comminuted (shattered into small pieces, for instance in a bullet wound) and when the bone is infected (osteomyelitis).|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, {{external}} <b>fixators</b> for deformity corrections {{range from}} a simple tube, fixed to steel half-pins, to a hexapod circular system, in which both hydroxylapatite-coated half-pins and tension wires can be used. All systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Circular <b>fixators</b> are more commonly used in complex deformities that need correction and lengthening in all dimensions. Especially, the circular <b>fixators</b> with a hexapod system show a growing popularity because of their versatility and accuracy [1, 2, 3]. The disadvantage of the circular <b>fixators</b> is the volume they cover, {{and the fact that}} there is always a piece of metal between one’s legs.|$|R
40|$|Title: Electromyographic Analysis of the Different Handlebars Grips Effect on the Shoulder Blade <b>Fixators</b> Aims: The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to carry out a}} methodological study on the impact of different handlebars grips on the shoulder blades <b>fixators.</b> Result of the grip change is not only reduction of the upper <b>fixators</b> activity and the increase in the lower <b>fixators</b> activity but also co-contraction index increase and muscle fatigue reduction. Based on the hypothesis we assumed that the highest activity rate of the lower blades <b>fixators</b> and the lowest activity rate of the upper blades <b>fixators</b> will be during the handlebars brakes grip. The highest co- contraction index will occur during the handlebar brakes grip and the maximum muscular fatigue will occur during the grip {{at the top of the}} handlebars. The first part of the thesis is focused on the literature search and facts retrieval pertaining to the studied issue. In the second special part of the thesis we conducted a research during which the muscle activity of the upper and lower blade <b>fixators</b> was recorded. Three different handlebars grips were considered during the measurement using the cycle ergometer. Methods: Muscle activity was scanned and recorded using surface EMG. Maximal voluntary contraction of selected muscles based on [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Treatment has {{historically}} centered on removing mechanical {{pressure from the}} joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, {{with an average of}} 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. [...] Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination. [...] These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. [...] Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. [...] Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis. These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. [...] For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external <b>fixator</b> which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. [...] This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow. The Perthes Association has a [...] "library" [...] of equipment which can be borrowed to assist with keeping life as normal as possible, newsletters, a helpline, and events for the families to help children and parents to feel less isolated.|$|E

Stainless steel (or titanium) rings are {{fixed to the}} bone via stainless heavy-gauge wire (called [...] "pins" [...] or Kirschner wires). The rings are connected to each other with threaded rods attached through adjustable nuts. The circular construction and tensioned wires of the Ilizarov apparatus provide far more structural support than the traditional monolateral <b>fixator</b> system. This allows early weightbearing.|$|E
5000|$|The first 2nd Generation Circular External <b>Fixator,</b> an Hexapod External <b>Fixator</b> Frame, was {{developed}} in the 1990s. Even though the 2nd Generation External <b>Fixator</b> represented an improvement over the 1st Generation, it was very cumbersome to use manually. Computer applications were developed to facilitate its use; however, its applications were still limited. Calculations with the [...] method are many times inaccurate, leading to complications when controlling the bone deformity correction. In addition, the dependence of the patient on the hospital is increased in cases of severe deformities, which require strut exchange when using the hexapod method. Since the treatment cannot be finished in one session and requires frequent check-up, the patient suffers additionally from more X-ray examinations. The 2nd Generation Computer Assisted Eternal <b>Fixator</b> also required extensive training and experience {{on the part of the}} physicians. These limitations prevented 2nd Generation Fixators from completely supplanting the original Ilizarov design.|$|E

50|$|The Octopod Circular External <b>Fixator</b> is {{medical device}} {{developed}} to treat bone fractures and deformities. The device consists of 4 main vertical struts between 2 rings and 4 assistant diagonal struts. This 3rd Generation Circular External <b>Fixator</b> thus contains 8 combined mobile struts {{from which it}} derives its octopod name. With the octopod method the device can reach a wider correction range, thereby solving a major problem of the 2nd Generation Circular External Fixators, that of having to frequently change struts. The previous difficulties in taking manual measurements when using both 1st and the 2nd Generation External Fixators are resolved by using the 3rd Generation Circular External <b>Fixator.</b>|$|E

50|$|External {{fixation}} is {{also used}} in limb lengthening. People with short limbs can have, for example, legs lengthened. In most cases the thigh bone (femur) is cut diagonally in a surgical procedure under anesthesia. External <b>fixator</b> pins or wires (as above) are placed {{each side of the}} 'man made fracture' and the external metal apparatus is used to very gradually push {{the two sides of the}} bone apart millimetre by millimetre day by day and week by week. Bone will gradually grow into the small gap created by this 'distraction' technique. Such a process can take many months.In most cases it may be necessary for the external <b>fixator</b> to be in place for many weeks or even months. Most fractures heal in between 6 and 12 weeks. However, in complicated fractures and where there are problems with the healing of the fracture this may take longer still. It is known that bearing weight through fracture by walking on it, for example, with the added support of the external <b>fixator</b> frame actually helps fractures to heal.|$|E
