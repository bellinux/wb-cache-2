5|$|Another common {{adaptation}} is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) {{that fits}} into a common basketball court sized arena. This was quite popular when races {{were held at}} imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square <b>Garden,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.|$|E

5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|The M21 {{served on}} the Western Front, seeing action in Normandy and in {{southern}} France, before later being used during the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Belgium, Operation Market <b>Garden,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Germany from the west. The M21 served with the US 3rd, 1st, and 7th Armies during the campaign in France, and the 2nd Armored Division, which developed it. In addition, 57 examples were leased to Free French forces. By 1945, it was declared obsolete, due to the insufficient power of the 81mm mortar as an artillery piece.|$|E

5|$|The Sounders {{hosted the}} San Jose Earthquakes at Starfire on June 24 and both teams {{scored in the}} first half. The Earthquakes second-string goalie, David Bingham, kept his team in the match by {{stopping}} three shots from Chad Barrett late in the second half.

5|$|The {{ruins of}} St Peter's Church are a {{memorial}} to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol, and a plaque on its wall lists their names. Adjoining the church is a sensory herb <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five Silver Birch trees, managed by Bristol's D-Day veterans, {{in memory of the}} five D-Day beaches. There are also memorials for trees for Anne Frank and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise is a 2008 {{simulation}} {{video game}} in the Viva Piñata series for the Xbox 360. Developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios, the game builds atop its predecessor, in which the player tends a <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> piñata creatures that come to live there. New features to the series include a cooperative multiplayer mode, a new plot, additional types of piñata creatures, Xbox Live Vision Camera support, and two new areas for capturing piñatas.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{personal}} interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, {{as a member of}} CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.|$|E
5|$|Laporte died suddenly, and Benjamin Lumley {{took over}} the {{management}} in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, Don Pasquale and La fille du régiment. Initially, relations between Lumley and Michael Costa, the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. Verdi's Ernani, Nabucco and I Lombardi received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned I masnadieri from the composer. This opera received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva Jenny Lind {{in the role of}} Amalia, and the British premieres of two more Verdi operas, I due Foscari and Attila, followed in 1847–48. Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal, Covent <b>Garden,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Sir David further {{extended}} the castle {{in the late}} 16th century, {{with the addition of}} a large north range with round corner towers. He laid out the garden in 1604, with symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland, to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year, when James VI acceded to the English throne on the death of his cousin, Elizabeth I. Sir David died in 1610, heavily in debt as a result of fines handed down for the unruly conduct of his son, and with both the <b>garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> north range incomplete.|$|E

5|$|Special springs can {{be found}} {{near the top of}} certain acts. By jumping onto these springs, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent falling down a tube on a {{snowboard}} while trying to collect enough rings to meet the target amount. By completing the stage, the player receives a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds unlocks the game's true ending. The game also features a minigame called the Tiny Chao Garden, in which players can raise Chao. Players can transfer their Chao between the Tiny Chao <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chao Garden from the GameCube versions of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four owners of the game can race {{to the end of a}} level or search for Chao.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Mahisorn Prasat (พระที่นั่งมหิศรปราสาท) {{is a small}} {{pavilion}} {{built on}} the wall between the Siwalai <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Maha Monthien buildings. The pavilion has a mondop style roof and a gilded spire, decorated in glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a monument to his father King Rama II. After its completion the ashes of King Rama II was moved and was housed in the pavilion. After the death of King Rama IV the ashes was {{moved back to the}} Ho Phra That Monthien Buddha Image Hall, currently the pavilion houses several Buddha images.|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's <b>Garden</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kitchen garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E
