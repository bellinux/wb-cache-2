25|$|On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> of {{his home}} out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving {{numerous}} times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro {{on the street and}} killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally got the last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Madonna and her dancers go <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> {{to a bar}} where the singer forcefully makes Kortajarena drink a beverage, dry humps a dancer and {{continues}} dancing. The guest appearances start with Cyrus pointing her middle finger towards the camera wearing glitter around her eyes, followed by Wang, Diplo and Rocco in the bar, Beyoncé posing like Madonna's music video for [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990), Perry moving around to the song, and David dancing while Madonna and the others cheer him; all of them mouth the song name while they appear onscreen. As the chorus ends, a dancer brings a video screen behind them where Minaj appears rapping her part, interspersed by shots of West cheering. Madonna and her dancers continue moving through the room with falling confetti and reach a dance pole. She climbs {{through a set of}} dimly lit stairs and reaches the rooftop where the party is taking place. The song nears to an end and Madonna is shown surrounded by her dancers and some partygoers while she lies down; interspersed scenes show her twerking and dancing alone in a room wearing a cap with Hebrew word [...] "" [...] ("Shalom") written on it. The video ends with a far away shot of the Standard Hotel's brightly lit rooftop where the party continues.|$|E

50|$|For safety, the {{building}} has smoke evacuators in each floor designed to siphon smoke <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> in cases of fire, supported by automatic smoke/fire detection and alarm system with quick response sprinklers, and pressurized fire exits/stairwells.|$|R

60|$|Between them, {{the driver}} and Holder got the burden out of the {{carriage}} and up the steps. The light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> confirmed the rector's fear.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} wide, impelled by a {{powerful}} arm. Light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> streamed in over the burly form {{of a man in}} a heavy coat. He stood in the doorway evidently trying to see.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} career in journalism in 1947 {{as a writer and}} general {{assignment}} reporter for the Philadelphia Tribune and the Associated Negro Press. Poindexter spent 15 years with the Philadelphia Tribune as a writer, photojournalist, columnist, sportswriter, sports editor, city editor, business manager, assistant comptroller and comptroller. During the 1948 Democratic and Republican National Conventions, both of which were held in Philadelphia, Poindexter had to interview politicians and attendees <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> because black journalists were not allowed on the convention floors. Poindexter joined the staff of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin in 1960 and contributed feature articles to the newspaper's Sunday magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Turning away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Endless <b>Hallway,</b> guests travel past a glass Conservatory {{filled with}} dead, {{withered}} plants and flowers. In {{the middle of}} the room is a coffin occupied by a restless [...] "guest", plaintively wailing for someone to [...] "Let me out!. Perched near the coffin is a black raven with glowing red eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} my sister that thou art here," [...] said she, and away she ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> little stone <b>hallway,</b> {{carefully}} bolting and locking the further door behind her.|$|R
60|$|The sound {{made by the}} saw was so slight that it did {{not worry}} her, but another sound, of an entirely {{different}} character and coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> caused her to pause and glance over her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Then Master Fernald {{went out}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> {{in what he}} evidently {{believed}} was the most approved detective fashion of walking, and, as Plums confidentially told Joe later, [...] "he acted {{like he was a}} jumpin'-jack, with some one pullin' the string mighty hard." ...|$|E
60|$|Lawyer Gooch, then, sat idle in {{the middle}} room of his clientless suite. A small {{anteroom}} connected--or rather separated--this apartment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> Here was stationed Archibald, who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited.|$|E
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cafeteria; {{where some of}} them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around <b>the</b> corner <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Library <b>Hallway</b> in <b>the</b> main South <b>Hallway.</b> By now, Harris and Klebold were inside <b>the</b> main <b>hallway.</b> Sanders and another student were down at the end of <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner of <b>the</b> North <b>Hallway.</b> Sanders and <b>the</b> student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up <b>the</b> North <b>Hallway.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{consists}} of a central hallway containing a stair to the lower level, with three bedrooms opening <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left of the hall and two formal rooms opening <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>hallway</b> is a generous size and both front and rear doors are original and feature sidelights with Gothic arches and coloured glass. The formal living rooms contain back to back fireplaces {{and open to the}} verandah via French doors. The verandah surrounds four sides of the upper level and is enclosed at one side to form a storeroom. The house has been extended at the rear to form a family room, kitchen and bathroom. The core rooms on the upper level have vaulted ceilings of tongue and groove boarding and double-hung windows with distinctive top sashes with curved tops. <b>The</b> <b>hallway</b> ceiling has been lined with plasterboard. The original window and door joinery is intact. The verandah was enclosed earlier and no elements of the original detailing remain.|$|R
500|$|Grant {{had been}} careful {{to watch the}} {{elections}} and secretly sent Phil Sheridan in to keep {{law and order in}} the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans {{a few days before the}} January 4, 1875 legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel Régis de Trobriand, and the escaped Republicans were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> of <b>the</b> state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. [...] Trobriand returned to the State house and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. [...] Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.|$|R
60|$|In the {{resultant}} light the man saw {{with a quick}} glance a large room furnished with an old walnut bed, dresser, and commode; two lightless windows opened {{at the far end}} toward the road, Bridge assumed; and there was no door other than that against which he leaned. In the last flicker of the match the man scanned the door itself for a lock and, to his relief, discovered a bolt--old and rusty it was, but it still moved in its sleeve. An instant later it was shot--just as the sound of the dragging chain ceased outside. Near the door was the great bed, and this Bridge dragged before it as an additional barricade; then, bearing nothing more <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> he {{turned his attention to the}} two unconscious forms upon the floor. Unhesitatingly he went to the boy first though had he questioned himself he could not have told why; for the youth, undoubtedly, had only swooned, while the girl had been the victim of a murderous assault and might even be at the point of death.|$|E

500|$|Beiderbecke {{died in his}} apartment, No.1G, 43-30 46th Street, in Sunnyside, Queens, on August 6, 1931. The {{week had}} been quite hot, making sleep difficult, and late into the evenings, Beiderbecke had played piano, both to the {{annoyance}} and {{to the delight of}} his neighbors. On the evening of August 6, at about 9.30 pm, his rental agent, George Kraslow, heard noises coming <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> [...] "His hysterical shouts brought me to his apartment on the run," [...] Kraslow told Philip Evans in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The private rooms {{comprise}} a master bedroom and second bedroom opening off the central hall, and a side passage leading west <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hallway</b> to <b>the</b> dressing room, bathroom, and another bedroom.

50|$|Meanwhile, Kyle (Evan Peters) {{has been}} {{secreted}} away in Zoe's room {{and she tells}} him they are under attack. She fears for his safety the most, and he professes his love for her, as Madison listens <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Inside many {{original}} finishes remain. The lobby {{has been}} restored to its original appearance. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> lobby <b>hallways</b> lead to <b>the</b> Garden Terrace restaurant in a western annex, with an adjacent outdoor terrace south of the swimming pool.

50|$|The baptistry in {{the chapel}} is located {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> entrance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main <b>hallway</b> on <b>the</b> {{north side of the}} nave.

5000|$|The core has a modestly-sized central hallway, {{from which}} doors open {{off to the}} front parlour on the right, and the front bedroom and rear dining room on the left. The dining room has a fireplace, the brick chimney of which, {{formerly}} rendered, is now exposed. A narrow staircase leads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to two attic bedrooms, preventing any access <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to the rear bedroom on the right - this is accessed from the rear and north side verandahs. Evidence in the fabric indicates that this rear bedroom was at some period divided into two rooms, both accessed from the verandahs. The rear (south-west) verandah has been enclosed with [...] weatherboards and timber casement windows, possibly {{in more than one}} stage. In the process, a small room has been created at each end of this verandah.|$|E

50|$|The {{plantation}} {{house at}} Roseland Plantation {{began as a}} dogtrot house in 1835. A large two-story Greek Revival-style frame addition {{was added to the}} front of the dogtrot in the mid-1850s. The former front porch of the dogtrot became a cross-hall and the breezeway of the dogtrot was extended into a very long center-hall in the new construction. The upper floor was accessed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central <b>hallway</b> via a reverse staircase.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the rumor}} of this arrangement, the mere {{possibility}} of the alliance of an economically strong NUS with Gustavus caused Cardinal Richelieu to switch his support of the Swedish king {{in the spring of}} 1632 and generated a direct battle in Grantville in the fall of 1632 with Croatian cavalry forces sent by Catholic General Albrecht von Wallenstein {{towards the end of the}} first book to destroy Grantville and its knowledge base. Gustavus himself, leading a small cavalry scouting group, deduced the pending attack and enemy's plan and led his small force of 400 Laplanders and Finnish light cavalry in a [...] "hell ride" [...] pursuing the enemy cavalry arriving in time annihilating the remaining enemy forces at the town's high school. With the rescue, Stearns recognized the inevitable, the NUS needed a strong protector, and he and Gustav began negotiating an accommodation in the high school library with Rebecca Abrabanel as translator, even as wounded were being triaged and the bodies were being cleared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> and grounds.|$|R
25|$|Questioned by The Detroit News {{why it took}} 41 {{minutes to}} get a medic to the scene after the {{bodyguard}} found Cornell lying on the floor, Police insisted there are no gaps.
