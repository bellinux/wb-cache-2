40|$|International audienceThis {{special issue}} {{is devoted to}} the idea that {{approaching}} disability from the periphery has a heuristic value that allows an improved understanding of just what the field of disability is. By paying attention to borderline situations, by examining cases where disability merges into other qualifications (validity, illness, poverty…), by positioning ourselves on the boundaries shaping the field of disability, we learn as much, if not more, about its core as we would by addressing the most typical figures of disability head-on. Using Ravaud, Letourmy and Ville’s image of the rosette, one might say that our approach is focused not on the centre of the flower where the overlapping criteria (official disability recognition, presence of everyday limitations, self-designation as disabled person, etc.) make situations conceptually obvious, but instead on the petals, where the various dimensions of disability disconnect. From this angle, the domain of employment and the issue of the recognition of “handicapped workers” provide particularly interesting material for analysis. The five contributions gathered in this issue thus address various borders of disability while sharing a common theme, the relationship to employment. The first two deal with the boundary between disability and illness; the first, (Jacques Rodriguez, “A course of treatment: Putting people with tuberculosis to work in England and France in the 1920 s”), questions the place of work in the treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis in the early 20 th century, when the category of disability was still only in its infancy but ripe for development in these early assemblies of sick people with irreversible physical effects (Ville, 2010); the second (Audrey Parron, “Autonomy issues for young adults dealing with psychic disorders”) focuses on mentally ill youths’ transition to adulthood, at the moment when the issues of their autonomy and a potential recognition of psychic disability, possible under French law since 2005, take urgency. The third contribution (Samuel Neuberg, “Poverty as a situation of disability: Social workers’ reticence to back Active Solidarity Income (RSA) beneficiaries’ requests for <b>Disabled</b> <b>Adults</b> <b>Allowance</b> (AAH) ”) also deals with programs for gaining autonomy and support for finding employment, but in this case focusing on people receiving social assistance, on the border between disability and social marginality. Lastly, the final two contributions address disabled persons more explicitly, questioning the boundary between disabled workers and disabled persons. The first (Louis Bertrand, Vincent Caradec and Jean-Sébastien Eideliman, “Situating disability. The recognition of ‘handicapped workers’ in France”) deals with the relative weight of social situations and individual characteristics in the recognition of “handicapped workers” in the French setting, while the second (Trudie Knijn and Frits van Wel, “Better at work: Activation of partially disabled workers in the Netherlands”) addresses the effects of new policies for the recognition of partial occupational disability on individuals in the Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSocial {{service support}} for {{beneficiaries}} of the French RSA (minimum income scheme) is based on reducing their problems {{to a series of}} situations blocking their “plans to return to employment”. These situations are defined in practice by the specific “programs” toward which professional may orient beneficiaries. This notion is quite close to that of “situation of disability”, as it is used in social conceptions of disability. It is the support for a specific handicapology, rooted in a representation of social service work in rupture with the traditional notion of support for disabled persons, those unfit for work. It is characterized particularly by a refusal to sort beneficiaries into overarching categories, and a change in the meaning given to people's material and cultural destitution, which is not treated as a consequence of unemployment or as a disability, but as a disabling situation responsible for their withdrawal from the employment market. These professional norms are manifest in a strong resistance when beneficiaries express the desire to seek AAH (<b>disabled</b> <b>adult</b> <b>allowance).</b> This reticence is explained by the simultaneous transformations of both the administrative division of social support work and the social trajectories of the social workers charged with this work. AAH requests place professionals in a paradoxical situation: their general role to support people in their administrative procedures comes into contradiction with their mission to “support toward employment”, which they find radically incompatible with the posture of assistance implied by the recognition of even a partial unfitness for work...|$|R
40|$|In Gosta Esping-Andersen’s {{paradigmatic}} {{analysis of}} welfare capitalism (1990), the French welfare state is {{classified in the}} conservative corporatist regime. 1 France is generally recognized as belonging to the Bismarckian family of welfare states because of the centrality of social insurance. In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, <b>allowance</b> for <b>disabled</b> <b>adults,</b> integration <b>allowance,</b> specific solidarity allowance, lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small invalidity insurance benefits), widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|R

Often there are few appropriate alternatives in education to handle their needs. This thesis examines an alternative that has great promise asan appropriate approach to the learning needs of the developmentally <b>disabled</b> <b>adult.</b> Using 4 -H concepts as a lifelong education alternative, Elkhart County has demonstrated the success of an informal and flexible educational program that can be offered {{for as long as the}} developmentally <b>disabled</b> <b>adult</b> wishes. As a pilot program for the past four years, 4 -H has continued to grow in areas of enrollment, projects selected, community awareness, personal growth, state and national interest. This paper takes into account the problems, successes, leadership requirements, materials adaptations, and career development of both youth and adults. Much work remains to be done in the area of lifelong educational alternatives for the developmentally <b>disabled</b> <b>adult</b> so that each person continues to grow through his/her life.

40|$|The {{personalisation}} {{of adult}} social care {{has the potential}} to create support that is individualised, and it is the reality of this support relationship that forms the basis of this article. To date, there have been few studies that focus on the association between care users and their workers. Here, we consider research from a Ph. D. study that allows for comparison between two sets of relationships: between <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> and homecare workers employed by a local authority, and between <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> using direct payments to employ their own personal assistants. The research pays attention to the meanings attached to the concepts of independence and autonomy, with a model of autonomy applied to aid clarity and develop our understanding of complexities in support relationships. The research uses a grounded theory approach with qualitative interviews of matched samples of respondents, providing new evidence about the personalised relationship. Based on the research, we argue that direct employment of support workers appears to facilitate greater autonomy for <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> than traditional homecare relationships. However, the research goes on to suggest that greater autonomy for <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> may have a downside for support workers...|$|R

40|$|Developments {{in recent}} years have shown an {{increasing}} interest in the educational needs and aspirations of <b>disabled</b> <b>adults.</b> There is still, however, limited research information representing the disabled person's voice. This paper describes the outcomes from a survey of the educational experiences of 44 physically <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> in the North West of England. The findings indicated that, usually, the earlier someone had acquired a disability, the less likely they were, as adults, to have achieved professional or higher qualifications, and that the level of qualifications reached among women being surveyed was particularly low. Barriers to course attendance reflect both attitudinal and practical access issues, with underachievement often the result of oppression from a variety of sources. Both positive and negative experiences from <b>disabled</b> <b>adults</b> form the basis of recommendations for an equal opportunities approach to <b>adult</b> education for <b>disabled</b> people around the themes of integration, self worth, empowerment and consultation...|$|R

The prevalence of severely limiting pain increased with age declining beyond age 55 though younger <b>disabled</b> <b>adults,</b> and women generally, reported more severe pain symptoms. Pain was associated with disabilities which commonly have a physical origin and directly affect bodily movement, compounding the problems of daily living for this population.
