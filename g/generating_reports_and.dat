40|$|Abstract: The project {{described}} in this article is less about the content area, computational cell biology, and more about the educational practice of the students and faculty involved. Over {{the course of the past}} four years, Dr. Raquell Holmes has worked to create curricular resources that support the integration of modeling methods in biology education. For three of those years, students have been involved in the research required to develop chapters for a textbook in progress. This research experience for students is similar to other research experiences which include students identifying primary literature, participating in lab meetings, <b>generating</b> <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> giving presentations. A unique feature of this research experience was its explicit focus on creating a group-learning environment. Students were hired based on their interests in the project and their willingness to work in groups. We describe the process that lead to the creation of a group-learning environment that supports the development of both students and faculty as researchers and academics. We understand this to have been a cultural, performatory process and introduce both the metaphor and practice of performance, particularly improvisation, in undergraduate education and research...|$|E
40|$|The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) {{modeling}} {{system has been}} updated with new quality assurance capabilities. We have added a module to SMOKE that provides a flexible, userdefined approach for <b>generating</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> summaries for quality assurance of emissions data. The new module, called "Smkreport," also provides a framework for much more easily adding new types of summaries {{to meet the needs}} of the modeling community. Users of Smkreport can control most of the major features of the emissions summaries, such as: pollutants to include, their order, and units; selection of inventory records by region (e. g., state and county codes), model grid cells, and arbitrary combinations of regions and grid cells; and the basis of emission summaries (e. g., state codes, county codes, source category codes, by hour or daily total, grid cell, road class, or any combination). The emission values in the reports can optionally include gridding factors, speciation factors, and temporal factors, which permits the users to make comparisons of summary emissions at various stages of emissions processing. The Smkreport module has been used to quality assure emissions data processing of the 1996 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for a yearlong modeling episode.

40|$|With {{the onset}} of the {{information}} age, archivists are more frequently placed in professional situations where they must work with automated systems to manage the records in their custody. They must acquire new skills to use this technology, including system analysis, system planning, and the principles of computer operation. An area that is frequently neglected, however, is that of developing and maintaining in-house project documentation for systems once equipment is in place and implementation has begun. This oversight leads to poor training strategies, inconsistencies in input and output, and information loss when personnel changes occur. Project documentation is the group of records that describe the system the archivist creates. It is a communications tool, developed by the project manager as a reference document for administrative and operations purposes, and to train users. The documentation guidelines assembled in this text were developed by the author while implementing automated systems over a six-year period. They are arranged in five groups. SCOPE discusses ways to introduce the user to the project, the equipment, and to the concept of the project manual.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 25). The purpose of this report is to assess whether the implementation of Sales Force Automation for Robi Axiata Limited is an effective step. Robi Axiata Limited, a leading telecommunications service provider in Bangladesh has always {{been in the forefront}} of when it came to innovation. In order to stay competitive in a challenging environment, Robi Axiata has decided to take advantage of an automation tool that is limited in use in the country. This tool, known as Sales Force Automation allows the sales process to be almost completely automated {{with the help of an}} Android based application. The main purpose behind moving forward with such a tool is to track performance to Robi’s sales teams and products and services. This tool also allows employees to become more productive, whether it is in the field, making sales calls, or in the office, <b>generating</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> making critical decisions. The Sales Force Automation (SFA) tool in divided into three tiers – the application, the database, and the server. All these three tiers combined help Robi’s employees to automate the sales, reporting, and evaluation aspect of the business. The success of SFA for Robi ultimately depends on the acceptance and adoption of this technology by the employees of the company. This is why it is imperative that the different teams be trained thoroughly regarding the usage of the platform, as well as the benefits they, and the organization as a whole, can gain from the proper utilization of such an innovative tool.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with K. M. Davies Co. Inc., apple storage operator, we propose to conduct hands-on workshops {{in computer technology}} for apple growers that will improve their business success by promoting information technology adoption. This workshop will provide a model for comparable training partnerships {{that can be easily}} deployed to benefit tree fruit growers in New York. We are building on previous successes of the two Project Leaders. Carroll worked with Debbie Doubrava, Minard Farms, Clintondale, NY, to develop a TracApple software workshop for apple growers in {{conjunction with}} Highland High School, which donated use of their computer lab stating that keeping apple growers profitable and in business via computer technology workshops was good for their community. Joki worked with Tim Moore, Canandaigua Wine Co., and Tim Martinson, Yates County Cornell Cooperative Extension, to develop a computer technology curriculum including introductory and advanced sessions in Excel, Word, and QuickBooks, offered at Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) to grape growers. The median age of apple growers in New York is climbing and it is imperative we demystify computers and associated information technologies for this audience so they can capture the market edge that traceability offers. Our ability to develop a computer workshop for apple growers featuring user-friendly, utilitarian TracApple© software will make it more likely that that they will adopt the use of computers and continue using them even after the workshop is over. K. M. Davies seeks to improve the computer literacy of their growers recognizing that it will greatly facilitate keeping records, <b>generating</b> <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> tracing product. The ability to use Excel, TracApple, email and the Internet are skills that growers can quickly put to use to improve business management on their farms and communicate reports to storage operators and potential buyers. In an increasingly global market, the ability to trace back product to the seller and to the producer, to quickly access all the production records associated with that commodity, will prove to be a critical market edge...|$|E
40|$|While the Department of Surgery {{is renowned}} for {{operating}} on people, Velvet Cain specializes in {{another type of}} “surgery”: analyzing and managing complex numbers. As the Department’s Senior Financial Analyst, she is instrumental in planning budgets, tracking expenses, <b>generating</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> monitoring various components of compensation for faculty and nonfaculty staff. Velvet joined Jefferson in 1999 as a staff accountant in the Controller’s Office. She transferred to Jefferson University Physicians’ Finance Department in 2001 before assuming her current position in Surgery in 2007. While she has remained in the same role, her dayto- day work has changed dramatically over the past nine years. For starters, she says, the number of staff within the Department has grown tremendously. Faculty alone have increased from 25 to more than 50 —doubling her workload in terms of financial oversight and planning for all clinical and academic activities. The tools she uses have evolved, as well. Spreadsheets {{are no longer the}} preferred method for budgeting; instead, she now uses sophisticated software. Velvet notes that her favorite part of the job is budgeting, and she is proudest of her contributions to controlling costs: “The budget is very challenging,” she says. “As we face challenges in the healthcare environment, setting and sticking to our budgets is more important than ever. I work hard to make sure we stay within what we budgeted. ” While some of her friends have questioned how she doesn’t get “bored” looking at numbers all day, she asserts that her job is anything but dull. “Someone always needs a report, and everyone wants something simple—on a single page,” she explains, adding that those “simple” reports require a lot of work on her part. She thoroughly enjoys the process of extracting, analyzing and presenting data from multiple sources. And she takes seriously the opportunity to lessen the administrative burden for her colleagues who deliver patient care: “I know how important it is for them to focus on their patients. When they have a purchasing, accounts payable or other administrative issue, I am always available to help them— even if it means making a ‘house call’ to where they are. ...|$|E

40|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of professions to provide evidence of the demonstrable value and quality of service delivery. Occupational therapists in mental health care settings find it difficult to produce convincing evidence of the demonstrable value and their contribution to health care. Currently no effective outcome measure for occupational therapists in mental health practices exists for the South African context. The development of an outcomes measuring system is much needed in these crucial times of cost-cutting, rendering quality of care with the minimum resources and the quest for evidence of the effect of intervention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to fill the outcome measurement gap by developing a system that is clinically tested and user-friendly for occupational therapists in mental health care settings. Such a system had to represent the outcomes in the occupational therapy programmes, meet the needs of the therapist in terms of purpose of the tool, be easily administered and be standardised. It was also important that the outcome measure was grounded in the theoretical framework that guides intervention programmes, namely Vona du Toit’s Model of Creative Ability. This theoretical framework is widely used in South African mental health care settings and was found suitable to be transformed into a rating scale for the outcome measure. A participatory approach combined with a mixed method exploratory design, specifically the instrument development model, was selected to guide the study. The development of the outcome measure happened in three phases. Domains for the outcome measure emerged after participation from occupational therapy clinicians and mental health care users in Phase 1. The operationalisation of the domains and the development of the rating scale happened during Phase 2. The third phase was the piloting of the outcome measure to identify issues to be optimised for the final implementation of the outcome measure. Eight domains with 52 representative items emerged from Phase 1. The domains were Process skills, Communication and Interaction skills, Lifeskills, Role performance, Balanced lifestyle, Motivation, Self-esteem and Affect. Clinicians were satisfied that these domains represented the service that they deliver and compared well with the mental health care users’ need for occupational therapy. The involvement of mental health care users in confirming relevant domains for the outcome measure ensured a client-centred approach in the research process. The outcome measure, named as the Activity Participation Outcome Measure (APOM), has a unique feature of <b>generating</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> spider graphs for every mental health care user. The APOM was piloted in three mental health care settings. In spite of good intentions from clinicians to apply the measure, it was clear that measuring outcomes is neither a priority, nor a routine task in clinical settings. The preliminary investigation into the psychometric properties yielded positive results. However, the sample sizes for the validity and reliability samples were not optimal and further data collection needs to continue for confirmation. It is recommended that investigations into the psychometric properties of the instrument continue to eventually market it as a valid and reliable outcome measure for occupational therapists in mental health care settings.
