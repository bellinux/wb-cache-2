40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of mobile and location aware devices allows the deployment of <b>infomobility</b> systems that provide access to information and services {{for the support of}} user mobility. Current systems for <b>infomobility</b> services assume that most information is already available on the mobile device and the device connectivity is used for receiving critical messages from a central server. However, we argue that the next generation of <b>infomobility</b> services will be characterized by collaboration and interaction among the users, provided through realtime bidirectional communication between the client devices and the <b>infomobility</b> system. In this paper we propose an innovative architecture to support next generation <b>infomobility</b> services providing interaction and collaboration among the mobile users that can travel by several different transportation means, ranging from cars to trains to foot.

However, several studies have asserted that they not always are effective in improving transport systems, since they do not convey the required information to mobility managers and customers. On the basis of existing academic contributions in the transport information quality and information quality literature, this study addresses the concept of <b>Infomobility</b> Quality, proposing a comprehensive framework that encompasses the main quality dimensions to be considered in the design and assessment of the quality and potential effectiveness of the <b>Infomobility</b> system.

40|$|In recent years, <b>infomobility</b> {{started to}} be {{considered}} a key instrument in relation to sustainable mobility. <b>Infomobility</b> has a potential to decrease environmental, social and economic transportation costs, gathering a wide range of information about mobility dynamics that can increase users' awareness and improve the management of the mobility system. However, from an academic point of view, there is a high confusion about this term due to the high fragmentation and heterogeneity of the literature. To provide a possible answer to this problem, this article aims to perform a literature review of the concept of <b>infomobility,</b> proposing a reference framework to go through existing contributions. The framework encompasses four main dimensions of infomobility: value chain, application areas, technologies and actors.

40|$|In recent years, printed reflectarray (RA) {{have become}} more and more popular, because of their {{well-known}} advantages with respect to traditional parabolic reflectors. Their design could however be quite expensive from a computational point of view, since it requires the fulfillment of several constraints, that could be contrasting each other, and the management of many degrees of freedom, that are necessary to satisfy the design specifications. As the number of (geometrical) parameters to optimize in order to obtain the required radiating characteristics increases, their management can no longer be performed “by hand” and the use of a global optimization tool becomes almost mandatory.

40|$|Several {{studies on}} the use of web {{services}} and specifically those related to <b>infomobility</b> services, prove their fast penetration to the market and foresee their high increase over the next years. Such services are offered through the mobile phone or PDA, where the travelers receive location-based information. On the other hand, that gradual difusion of Advanced Driver Information Systems (ADAS) and their integration by the vehicle manufacturers aims at the enhancement of traffic safety. However, the benefits of such systems to the traffic safety may be significantly reduced by the inappropriate behaviour of the drivers towards the relevant technologies, e. g. overconfidence to the system that leads to the reduction of attention on the road or behavioural adaptation that compensates the additional safety aspects. Systems with automatic adaptation capabilities, according to the ‘needs and wants’ of each driver, constitute an optimal solution, reducing the driver workload by using ADAS and increasing his/her comfort while driving. The aim of the current PhD dissertation is the optimization of <b>infomobility</b> services for travelers, as welll as drivers warning systems regarding danger stemming both from the longitudinal and lateral road axes, through their personalization. Thus, particular algorithms are proposed, based upon a number of relevant parameters (static, semidynamic and dynamic), leading to a holistic personalization. The drivers’ warning algorithms are based on dynamic parameters that determine their personal driving style, being the reaction time, the distance to line crossing (or alternatively the time to line crossing) and the time to collision or time headway. The <b>infomobility</b> personalisation algorithms for travelers are based on the user’s previous selections and are distinguished as follows: route selection information, points-of-interest (POIs) selection information and pushed information (by the system itself, without prior request by the user). The parameters that constitute the route selection algorithm are the maximum accepted walking distance per transportation means connection, the accepted travel means and the maximum accepted number of transportation mean changes during a multimodal trip. Secondary parameters are also taken into account, which are the shortest or the cheapest route. The parameters used for the POI selection personalization are the POI type (hotel, restaurant, etc.), its sub-type (e. g. restaurant type: Italian, traditional, Chinese, etc.), the day of the week (either weekday or weekend) and of course the user’s past selections. The last parameter is also used for the personalization of the “pushed” service (service proposed to the user without explicitly asking for them). Following, a short description of the dissertation contents is given. Chapter 1 presents the market situation and trends in relation to the location-based <b>infomobility</b> services through the mobile devices, as well as the increasing use of ADAS and the need for their adaptation and personalisaiton for the enhancement of traffic safety. The methodology used throughout the whole document and the interconnection among its chapters are analysed in Chapter 2. The clustering of travelers, along with the analysis of their characteristics, are included in Chapter 3. The 4 th Chapter starts by presenting existing clustering of ITS (ADAS, In-Vehicle Information and Communication Systems - IVICS and road users information systems), to conclude to a new, more systematic clustering. Additionally, a description of the functionalities of the two ADAS for which innovative algorithms are developed, is provided (namely Lane Deviation Warning and Frontal Collision Warning systems). Within the same chapter, best practices on Human Machine Interaction (HMI) concepts and elements for providing the information and warning of the above-mentioned ADAS to the driver, are included. The various HMI types are analysed and the need for different HMI by various drivers categories is highlighted, through the presentation of past evaluation results of relevant systems. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Local Public Transport is {{vulnerable}} to reduction of public funding even when users’ expectations increase. The only way to develop and maintain adequate levels of service may be to promote solutions that rely on additional (cheap) resources. Those resources can be the users themselves, with their always-on personal devices and their willingness {{to participate in the}} improvement of this critical sector. This paper aims to show that more than competition and liberalization are needed to improve public transport services; the users’ positional disadvantage must be reduced and lack of power remedied. <b>Infomobility</b> should be personalized based on individual user preferences. Users should be empowered to influence the service, which will give flexibility to the system and foster bottom-up development. They can become partners in the design and innovation of public services and entrepreneurs in the exploitation of new services. The different levels of user involvement are described. In a traditional approach, user participation can be relatively passive: the Public Transport Service Provider can adopt models to capture and analyze patterns of user behavior. Public authority and service providers can rely on infrastructures, including sensors, probes, and bidirectional communication channels, of nearly zero cost for the transport operators. Following a widespread trend and the development of information technologies and social media, users can participate actively, even contributing to the design of new solutions. The paper, based on the recent literature on user-driven innovations, illustrates modes and roles of user participation in transport services, provides evidence of the feasibility of active user participation in innovation and design, and introduces design schemes that exploit information and telecommunication technologies, social networking, and crowdsourcing to involve users in the design and improvement of transport services.

40|$|AbstractIn the <b>infomobility</b> {{services}} {{regardless of}} transport modes, {{a key role}} is the real time availability of data and services from different providers and the share of information to users’ community through common mobile devices like PDAs and Smartphones. In order to achieve these goals {{a new approach to}} data collection, privacy policies and mobility client application with user friendly interfaces is required. These are the contents and goals of i-Tour Project (intelligent Transport system for Optimized URban trips), cofounded by EU in the 7 th FP. The Naples test site is a demonstration based on mobile integration platform concept, characterized by the presence of different transport operators sharing data and services for the i-Tour applications. The main topic of the Naples test site is the covering of different transport modes: trains and cableway from Circumvesuviana, motorway from Autostrade Meridionali, ships from Lauro Shipping and busses from Naples Province. Each transport operator is able to support the i-Tour needs with real time information about their services and planned information (like timetable, route, etc.), depending on users requests. The network of road data is provided by Navteq cartography while the environmental data are provided by Google weather services. Road network and weather services are common to all i-Tour test sites. The target of the Naples Test site is to develop a demonstration platform, based on transport services and other services, like weather, that will be integrated on a smartphone application interface, based on the Android operative system. The demo platform is a travel information system, composed {{of a wide range of}} personalized Location Based Services in order to support the user community with traffic events, tourist information, detailed point of interest and other kind of information including i-Tour recommendations.

40|$|The {{employment}} of mass market receivers in a differential mode {{is not a}} standard procedure, especially into a network for NRTK positioning. This is because only few mass market receivers are able to yield raw data as output, almost no one accepts differential corrections, and for many applications is sufficient the WAAS augmentation. In actual fact, the improvements {{that can lead to}} the establishment of a network of CORSs (Continuous Operating Reference Stations) can be much higher with regard to these receivers, on condition that the raw data (code or carrier phase measurements) are used with special precautions. These receivers are very often used for the purpose of <b>infomobility,</b> but can also be used for precise farming. In this chapter, attention is focused on the quality control of GNSS positioning in real time. The goal is to show how networks using NRTK (Network Real Time Kinematic) positioning for different inter-station distances may also be useful in a real-time approach. The objective is to show how CORSs networks are useful for mass-market receivers, considering the accuracy required for the purposes described above. The accuracy of real-time positioning depends mainly on the type of receiver (whether it is single frequency or low-cost) and antenna (whether it is patch, mass-market or geodetic) used, as well as also the size of the network dimension (Dabove et al., 2011). Numerous experiments have been carried out on different types of networks and differential corrections, so we would like to show the results of such tests for the quality control of real-time positioning. Excellent results are also been obtained with regard to two mass-market receivers and two antennas settled on the roof of a vehicle. The purpose of these experiments was not to determine the direction of the vehicle, but to constrain the ‘network' and, simultaneously, to filter the outliers. Particular attention has been devoted to the increasing the quality of the positioning of a C/A-code receiver in real time, and to analyzing and investigating the innovative methods tested by the authors that involve the indicators provided by the rover itself, such as the signal to noise ratio (S/N) and the redundancy of the observations. The experiments were conducted by splitting a single frequency antenna (Garmin) to both the receiver uBlox 6 T and the geodetic receiver (Leica 1200), using the VRS correction and the differential correction of the Nearest station (about 20 km far away). With regard to the VRS correction, the correct fixing of the ambiguity phase is more than 60 % of the trajectory and there were no false fixes. In such cases, the maximum planimetric error is less than 5 cm. Considering the positioning obtained by using float ambiguity (about 40 %) the errors can be tightly controlled within the previously established parameters (S/N and HDOP). In this way, at least 50 % of the trajectory has a maximum error of less than 20 cm. Using the Nearest correction, we have obtained a smaller quantity of integer ambiguity fix and, in this case, it is therefore possible to control the quality of the positioning using the HDOP and S/N parameter...|$|E

Intecs is active both in industrial partnerships and in national and international R&D projects. Intecs is an ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) member, active in the ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) and M 2 M technical committes, is an AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open Systems Architecture) premium member, a GENIVI member and also operates within the OneM 2 M. org. The Signals & Images Lab is a Research Laboratory of ISTI-CNR {{working in the fields}} of signal processing, image understanding and artificial vision. The Lab was born on the consideration that sensorial information is increasing its importance in both our daily life and the most advanced technological and scientific contexts. In particular, visual and audio information is becoming the most significant part of the global information to be processed, understood and manipulated. Nowadays, more than 35 people actively participate to the Lab, bringing together expertise ranging from computer science to mathematics, from physics to engineering. The general goal of the Lab is to increase the knowledge in the fields of signal processing, image understanding and artificial vision, in both theoretical and applicative contexts. This is achieved by studying and developing models, computer-based methods and machines for the formation, elaboration, analysis and recognition of images and signals, and by applying these methods and techniques to several sectors of the public and private society having strategic, scientific and technological interests. Carrying out these activities, the Lab has paid great attention to the development of semantic web technologies with the strong conviction that the web is the ideal platform for offering a rich range of benefits and smart services connected to the understanding of multimedia information. The Lab has participated to W 3 C activities including the Multimedia Semantics (MMSEM) Incubator Group. The Lab is currently involved in both Italian and European projects for <b>infomobility</b> and smart traffic management. The main focus is the design and development of innovative algorithms for real-time image understanding for the analysis of traffic flows and parking lot availability. The lab is interested in the possibility to integrate [...] thanks to the web [...] real-time information derived from pervasive sensor nodes inside the car and scattered along roads and cities with traffic models for personalized services. Viewpoint: Transportation systems are evolving towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where there is closed loop interaction between vehicles/drivers and the transportation infrastructure, as enabled by cooperative V 2 X communications and cellular networks. While some of the enabling technologies are entering their mature phase, e. g., traffic flow sensors and IEEE 802. 11 p, there is still the need of a complete integrated solution that can take the most benefits from a real-time analysis of the data gathered and appropriate reaction on the transportation system. This requires a higher level of intelligence to be integrated into the sensing and communication infrastructures, with decentralized aggregation and decision for robust and timely decisions to be taken. Finally, an additional and significant improvement can be brought by using tools that enable a pro-active decision making process, with the integration of predictive models running in real-time (even on board a car) alongside the reaction schemes. In this context, the web and HTML 5 may be the most appropriate (and ready to be exploited) ingredients to perform such integration. The dependence on road transport in our daily lives has grown massively in recent years, in line with the problems arising from its use: permanent congestion on highways and urban centres, energy waste, CO 2 emissions mass with consequent impact public health and high rates of accidents on the road networks. These challenges are even more pressing if we take into account the forecast growth in transport, as estimated by the Transport White Paper (March 2011) congestion costs will increase by about 50 % by 2050. Therefore, the main objective derived from them is to ensure that the mobility and transport are: more efficient, safer and energetically sustainable. Given the magnitude of these challenges conventional approaches such as new road construction or expansion of existing ones, will not bring the desired results in due time. It is clear that innovative solutions are needed to achieve rapid advances imposed by the urgency of the needs identified. And that is where Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) should play the role in contributing to tangible results quickly and efficiently. Taking into account these considerations, we aim to address simultaneously the challenges raised and thus give a qualitative leap towards the future mobility. This raises the implementation of a platform to merge and integrate heterogeneous data sources into a common system and provide a set of advanced tools for control, monitoring, simulation and prediction of traffic, that achieves a more safe, sustainable and uncongested road. Today ITSs are very complex systems, made of several subsystems working in isolation to provide dedicated functions. Such subsystems are often closed, i. e. they do not provide interfaces for direct access to third parties, and vertical, i. e. they provide an end-to-end system from sensors/actuators to the human-machine interface (HMI) of the system. Therefore, the fusion of data provided by different sub-systems operating in the same area is very difficult in practice and is bound to become worse in the future as the ICT infrastructure in transportation systems become bigger and more complex. In this context, we believe that semantic web technologies may become an essential framework to foster interoperability and information sharing across different ITSs. Suggestions: Our vision is to make such interaction between heterogeneous data sources as seamless as possible, by providing a common layer for data distribution, and to leverage such opportunity to shift the intelligence for decision making from humans in control centres to machines distributed within the ICT infrastructure itself. This machine-to-machine (M 2 M) interaction between sensors (e. g., traffic flow) and actuators will be enabled with local scope, so as to keep it effective while being efficient and highly scalable. In such vision, the mobile phone may act as the hub connecting the world to the car and thus it might be able to: - Convey real time information from the outside to the car for personalized services, including better, safer and more efficient driving experience. For example, real-time traffic conditions gathered by external wireless sensor network (e. g. smart camera networks) may be exploited for context-aware driving - Share {{the context in which the}} car is moving with the environment, e. g. reporting actual travel time - Connect with the sensors on the car (eg fuel consumption) to provide personalized smart services (e. g. suggesting driving styles) by using an on-board decision support system Existing and emerging web technologies can give a strong push to the development of the above-mentioned functionalities...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communications}} are nowadays {{a dominant}} {{part of our}} lives: from domotics, through industrial applications and up to <b>infomobility</b> services. The key to the co-existence of wireless systems operating in closely located or even overlapping areas, is sharing of the spectral resource. The optimization of this resource is the main {{driving force behind the}} emerging changes in the policies for radio resources allocation. The current approach in spectrum usage specifies fixed frequency bands and transmission power limits for each radio transmitting system. This approach leads to a very low medium utilization factor for some frequency bands, caused by inefficient service allocation over vast geographical areas (radiomobile, radio and TV broadcasting, WiMAX) and also by the usage of large guard bands, obsolete now due to technological progress. A more flexible use of the spectral resource implies that the radio transceivers have the ability to monitor their radio environment and to adapt at specific transmission conditions. If this concept is supplemented with learning and decision capabilities, we refer to the Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm. Some of the characteristics of a CR include localization, monitoring of the spectrum usage, frequency changing, transmission power control and, finally, the capacity of dynamically altering all these parameters (Haykin, 2005). This new cognitive approach is expected to have an important impact on the future regulations and spectrum policies. The dynamic access at the spectral resource is of extreme interest both for the scientific community as, considering the continuous request for wideband services, for the development of wireless technologies. From this point of view, a fundamental role is played by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) which in 2007 formed the Standards Coordinating Committee (SCC) 41 on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN) having as main objective a standard for dynamic access wireless networks. Still within the IEEE frame, the 802. 22 initiative defines a new WRAN (Wireless Regional Area Network) interface for wideband access based on cognitive radio techniques in the TV guard bands (the so-called “white spaces”). Coupled with the advantages and flexibility of CR systems and technologies, there is an ever-growing interest around the world in exploiting CR-enabled communications in vehicular and transportation environments. The integration of CR devices and cognitive radio networks into vehicles and associated infrastructures can lead to intelligent interactions with the transportation system, among vehicles, and even among radios within vehicles. Thus, improvements can be achieved in radio resource management and energy efficiency, road traffic management, network management, vehicular diagnostics, road traffic awareness for applications such as route planning, mobile commerce, and much more. Still open within the framework of dynamic and distributed access to the radio resource are the methods for monitoring the radio environment (the so-called “spectrum sensing”) and the transceiver technology to be used on the radio channels. A CR system works on a opportunistic basis searching for unused frequency bands called “white spaces” within the radio frequency spectrum with the intent to operate invisibly and without disturbing the primary users (PU) holding a license for one or more frequency bands. Spectrum sensing, that is, the fast and reliable detection of the PU’s even in the presence of in-band noise, is still a very complex problem with a decisive impact on the functionalities and capabilities of the CRs. The spectrum sensing techniques can be classified in two types: local and cooperative (distributed). The local techniques are performed by single devices exploiting the spectrum occupancy information in their spatial neighbourhood and can be divided into three categories (Budiarjo et al., 2008) : "matched filter" (detection of pilot signals, preambles, etc.), "energy detection” (signal strength analysis) and “feature detection" (classification of signals according to their characteristics). Also, a combination of local techniques in a multi-stage design can be used to improve the sensing accuracy (Maleki et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the above-mentioned techniques are mostly inefficient for signals with reduced power or affected by phenomena typical for vehicular technology applications, such as shadowing and multi-path fading. To overcome such problems, cooperatives techniques can be used. Cooperative sensing is based on the aggregation of the spectrum data detected by multiple nodes using cognitive convergence algorithms {{in order to avoid the}} channel impairment problems that can lead to false detections. (Sanna et al., 2009). Within the energy detection method, a particular attention needs to be paid to the properties of the packets wavelet transformation for subband analysis, which, according to the literature, seems to be a feasible alternative to the classical FFT-based energy detection. Vehicular applications are in most cases characterized by the need of coping with fast changes in the radio environment, which lead, in this specific case of cognitive communication, to constrains in terms of short execution time of the spectrum sensing operations. From this point of view, the computational complexity of the wavelet packets method is of the same order of the state-of-the-art FFT algorithms, but the number of mathematical operations is lower using IIR polyphase filters (Murroni et al., 2010). In our work we are investigating the use of the wavelet packets for energy detection spectrum sensing operations based on the consideration that they have a finite duration and are self- and mutually-orthogonal at integer multiples of dyadic intervals. Hence, they are suitable for subband division and analysis: a generic signal can be then decomposed on the wavelet packet basis and represented as a collection of coefficients belonging to orthogonal subbands. Therefore, the total power of the signal can be evaluated as sum of the contributions of each subband, which can be separately computed in the wavelet domain. Furthermore, the wavelet packets can be used also for the feature detection spectrum sensing, using statistical parameters such as moments and medians. We concentrate in our research on both applications of the wavelet packets to the spectrum sensing operations, investigating their efficiency in terms of reliability and execution time, applied specifically to the needs of vehicular technology and transportation environments. The other key issue for the development of the previously mentioned standard is the choice of an adaptive/multicarrier modulation as basic candidate for data transmission, having as the most known representative the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. OFDM-like schemes are mature enough to be chosen as a core technology for dynamic access wireless networks. At the same time, the potentialities in terms of optimization for this specific purpose are not yet thoroughly investigated. Particularly, the Wavelet Packet Division Multiplexing (WPDM) modulation method, already known for about ten years to the scientific community, is a suitable candidate to satisfy the requirements on physical level for a dynamic access network (Wong et al., 1997) : WPDM has already proven to be able to overcome some of the OFDM limits (limited spectral efficiency, problems with temporal synchronization especially in channels affected by fading) and is at the same time based on use of the same wavelet packets employed for subband analysis used for spectrum sensing operations. Our research investigates the use of the WPDM for cognitive radio purposes, combined with the wavelet approach for spectrum sensing, for offering a complete, wavelet-based solution for cognitive application focused on the problematic of vehicular communication (channel impairments, high relative velocity of the communication peers etc.). ...|$|E
