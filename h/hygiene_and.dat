40|$|This researchâ€™s main {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of Community Health Clubs as drivers of standard health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> in Mzilikazi District, Bulawayo. Poor service delivery by Bulawayo City Council in terms of Water Sanitation <b>and</b> <b>Hygiene</b> (WASH) results in increased prevalence of diarrheal diseases which claim a lot of lives especially for {{children under the age of}} five. The research targeted Mzilikazi, Makokoba and Njube the oldest suburbs in Bulawayo where the concept of Participatory Health <b>and</b> <b>Hygiene</b> Education through CHCs was implemented to improve <b>hygiene</b> practices <b>and</b> increase communityâ€™s resiliency to Water Sanitation <b>and</b> <b>Hygiene</b> related shocks such as diarrheal disease outbreaks. Responses from the participants illustrate that Community Health Clubs empowers people to take control of their own health, promote positive <b>hygiene</b> behaviour <b>and</b> create demand for sanitation. The researcher recommends that assessments on urban hazards and risks should be continued. In making progress towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals the concept of Participatory Health <b>and</b> <b>Hygiene</b> Education is important. There is need for engagement between the health clubs and the City Councils because these clubs are the custodians of household health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices <b>and</b> norms and are key transmitters of hygiene messages in the community hence having a major impact in reducing disease prevalence. Local authorities need to support the clubs to move from reactive crises management to proactive crises management...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Environmental Health)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 Good {{sanitation}} includes appropriate health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion. This {{implies that}} proper health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion {{would have the}} desired effect as part of sanitation service delivery. However, lessons learnt worldwide show that in the promotion of health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene,</b> {{it is not enough}} simply to provide facilities, because if people do not use the available facilities properly, conditions do not improve or the system breaks down. The 1986 Ottawa Charter of the World Health Organisation suggests that effective health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion requires the following key elements: • the empowerment of local communities to take responsibility for promoting sanitation and environmental health • collaborative partnerships of role-players across departments • supportive policy environments. Against this background. the focus of this study {{is the extent to which}} health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion forms part of sanitation delivery programmes to informal settlements in the City of Cape Town. The investigation was confined to a comparative review of approaches to health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion in four case study sites (Khayelitsha, Joe Slovo, Kayamandi and Imizamu Yetho) in the context of the following criteria: • Community and household capacity to take responsibility for community-based health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion • Role-players and collaborative partnerships across departments • Implementation of health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion <b>and</b> alignment with national policy. Analysis of the case studies highlights the ineffectiveness of once-off awareness campaigns and the need for a more comprehensive approach to health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion in line with the Ottawa Charter. The push towards universal coverage of basic sanitation services will not bring the intended health benefits of delivery if, for instance, the provision of toilets is not complemented by appropriate health <b>and</b> <b>hygiene</b> promotion programmes...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better <b>hygiene</b> <b>and</b> improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
