40|$|International audienceThe {{standard}} Linear Extended Yule Process is a well-adapted {{stochastic model}} for water pipes failure modelling, {{as it takes}} into account the past number of pipe failures, the ageing and the effects of covariates in the failure rate. But fluctuations of failures along time in water network show the limits of the model, which does not consider time-dependent covariates, like <b>frost</b> <b>effect.</b> An improvement of the model actually used in a standard tool such as PREVOIR Canalisation is therefore proposed that considers a time dependent covariate. This allows for dramatically improving the predictions of the number of pipe failures according to the climate...|$|E

Fusarium sulphureum had by far the highest pathogenecity among the tested species. Fusarium semitectum isolated from withered black locust tree also caused necrosis on significant bark area.

SMA mixture contained 6. 2 % of D 70 bitumen (currently 50 / 70) and 4 % SBS polymer labeled as Kraton 1101 CM. Hydrated lime was dosed into SMA mixture to replace 30 % of filler mass. Pavement surface condition after 12 years of service life was very good. In 2011 bitumen, extracted from SMA, tests were made. The tests covered bitumen samples which contained the fatty amine and the hydrated lime as a adhesive agent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis and}} performance comparison of a display cabinet system using refrigerant R 404 A and its substitute refrigerant R 22. The model of the display cabinet is developed at steady state and integrated from three main component sub-models, air-cooling finned-tube evaporator, air curtain and display cabinet body. The evaporator model is built up based on the distributed method, which can simulate the heat exchangers with different circuit structures. The <b>frost</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the performance of}} the evaporator is included in the model. The correlations for the heat transfer and pressure drop calculations of both air and refrigerant sides are purposely selected in the evaporator model. In addition, the evaporator model has been validated with experimental results at steady states from published literature. Several correlated functions from the detailed numerical solution are used for the model of the air curtain. Some simplifications are also utilized for the model of display cabinet body. The performance simulation and comparison of the display cabinet using refrigerants R 404 A and R 22 are carried out at different indoor ambient conditions especially at varied ambient air humidity to mimic the actual indoor space conditions in super stores. Some significant results such as the comparison of cooling load requirement for different refrigerant display cases have been obtained from the simulation, which can significantly contribute to the optimal cabinet design and operating analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For many decades, animal {{production}} in southern Brazil {{has been based}} on native forage grasses. Paspalum notatum Flügge (bahiagrass) {{is one of the most}} frequently used native grass in southern Brazil. The native germplasm of P. notatum is tetraploid and displays apomictic reproduction; hence, chromosome doubling of sexual diploid accessions is required to facilitate hybridization. The main goal of this study was to evaluate forage production and other agronomical evaluation of P. notatum intraspecific hybrids in order to obtain new varieties that could be registered and/or protected and launched as new cultivars in the future. Three tetraploid sexual genotypes were crossed with the ecotypes Bagual and André da Rocha. Biomass production (leaf, stem, and inflorescence fractions), plant growth habit, plant height, number of tillers, and frost damage were evaluated in the resulting hybrids. The general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were calculated for the six families generated. We evaluated 196 hybrids and the most productive yielded 42 % more total dry mass than the most productive parent (ecotype Bagual), and Bagual production was seven-fold higher than that of cultivar ‘Pensacola’. The highest GCA values were observed for Bagual and Q 4205. No correlation was observed between leaf coloration and the <b>frost</b> <b>effect</b> or regrowth in the following winter. Similarly, no correlation between plant growth habit and dry mass production was observed. The reproduction mode of the most productive hybrids are currently being analyzed in larger plots to identify apomictic and sexual genotypes for future registration and protection...|$|E

Another major facility, the <b>Frost</b> <b>Effects</b> Research Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw.

40|$|International audienceReversible {{heat pumps}} for {{electric}} vehicles {{are being developed}} by the car industry to address cabin heating and improve energy efficiency compared to electric heaters. For this new application, the front, louvered-fin, microchannel heat exchanger (MCHX or flat-tube heat exchanger) of the A/C system happens to operate as an evaporator under frosting conditions. MCHX are particularly sensitive to frosting, and a model is required to improve the design. This paper presents a dynamic pseudo 3 D model of a fan-supplied MCHX which predicts non-uniform frost growth, air pressure losses, airflow rate and thus, thermal performances. The air pressure losses are computed considering the maximum frost thickness along each air channel.

It became necessary to assess the intensity of damages so as to estimate sugar losses and identify the most affected area, where harvest should be held as a priority. Based on the report of sugarcane planted area and production levels issued by EEAOC in February to April 2007, Landsat 5 TM satellite images acquired in July were analyzed to differentiate damage degrees in sugarcane fields. Satellite image processing techniques and SIG tools were used, validating results against field data. Satellite images were first masked making sugarcane area the only one visible. Then, sugarcane areas harvested and not harvested were determined, checking what yield levels non-harvested sugarcane fields presented. Finally, a vegetation index was used (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) to classify non-harvested sugarcane fields into three groups according to degree of damages caused by frosts. When superimposing this last thematic layer with that of production levels, <b>frost</b> <b>effects</b> on the different productive levels of sugarcane fields were determined.

30|$|While low {{temperatures}} {{can have a}} significant impact on the development of maize, the impact of low temperature per se should be less pronounced for wheat [18, 19]. The increased abundance of lower temperatures can be explained through the earlier phenological development in both crops. While increased mean temperatures promotes an earlier phenological development in the crop model, shifts in temperature distributions in the projected climate can increase the abundance of lower temperature (Fig.  5). In addition, photoperiod and <b>frost</b> <b>effects</b> in the crop model hamper the accumulation of degree days and lengthen specific phenological stages, especially in winter wheat production, which is completely exposed to the period with short day length in Northern Germany. This suggests that frost conditions can be a reasonable threat in future German cropping systems. Similarly, Trnka et al. [15] identified an increased abundance of late frost for wheat production systems at several investigated sites, and increased winter frost abundance at continental sites in Europe. In contrast, Gobin [16] reported maize and wheat to benefit from earlier planting in Belgium. However, late frost abundance was not investigated in that study.|$|R

A study of Viking Orbiter imagery of Granicus Valles and the surrounding terrain in Elysium has produced further evidence of glaciation on Mars. Volcanism has {{played an important role in}} developing the landscapes of the Elysium region. A possible explanation is that subsidence occurred during formation of the Martian moberg ridges due to the melting of ground ice near the eruption area while at a distance most of the ground ice in the permafrost is still present and the original elevation was preserved. Meltwater during and following eruptions might be suddenly released during subglacial volcanism into Granicus Valles in one case and into Hrad Valles in the other.
