5000|$|Various {{instruments}} were typically provided, including a compass, altimeter, tachometer, oil <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator,</b> airspeed gauge, radiator temperature dial, <b>fuel</b> air <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator,</b> <b>fuel</b> selector, and air exchange; these were somewhat difficult to view {{due to their}} low-set position in the cockpit. According to [...] "Dodge" [...] Bailey, Chief Test Pilot of the Shuttleworth Collection, the S.E.5's cockpit was [...] "the best of the bunch from the era". Individual in-service S.E.5s would often receive customisations and user-specified tweaks {{at the request of}} their pilots. Popular changes included reducing the dihedral of the wings in order to increase its manoeuvrability and the removal of the head faring to increase the pilot's visibility to the rear. James McCudden, an ace pilot, was famous for his prolific fine-tuning of his aircraft in order to produce improved performance from it; McCudden was able to increase the top speed by 9 MPH and to raise the service ceiling from the standard 17,000 ft to 20,000 ft. His adaptions included replacing the standard pistons with high compression versions, shortening the exhaust (saving weight and improving exhaust scavenging), and changes to mixture, ignition and other engine settings as well as fitting a scavenged propeller spinner (which he himself credited as gaining 3 mph alone) [...]|$|R

40|$|The {{composite}} SARAS wing is a wet {{fuel tank}} enclosed by end ribs at station # 4, # 6 and # 20, rear spar, front spar, front beam, top skin and bottom skin. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{developed in the}} tank area due to the aircraft acceleration. The objective {{of this study is}} to check the safety of wing against combined effect of the critical air load and <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> on the wing structure acting simultaneously. Static and buckling analysis of the wing for the combined critical air load case and <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> case for ultimate load have been carried out to check the safety of the structure. Detailed studies have been made to understand the effect of <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> at the skin to rib and skin to spar joints using the results of global FE analysis. The bolts pull through load on top flange and T-pull load on bottom flange of all ribs and spars have been extracted based on the analysis. This is to ensure the safety of bolted joints on top side against bolt pull load and co-cured joints on bottom side against T-pull load. The strains are extracted for stringers, rib and spar gussets which have been modeled using one dimensional element to prove the safety against <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure.</b> Filler cap cut out has been modeled with actual edge distances and rivet forces are extracted for comparing with test results on a single lap bearing specimen...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility to capture the physical effect on the flow via a hybrid piezoelectric-shape memory alloy actuation at high Reynolds numbers using Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> at the trailing-edge of morphing wing prototype. The aim is to identify both the highand low-frequent turbulent structures using distributed pressure indicators and thereby identify the actuation effect on the flow.  To this end the design of the PVDF based <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> as a function of the Reynolds number, desired frequency and maximum attenuation will be described. Following this description of the design the numerical results are presented. Finally the experimental results will be presented and compared to the turbulent structures identified using high-speed Particle Image Velocimetry. It will be shown that the proposed PVDF based <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> is capable of capturing the aerodynamic phenomena on the trailing edge of an airfoil at high Reynolds numbers. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Indicators</b> {{of fishing}} <b>pressure</b> are {{necessary}} to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). We present a framework that distinguishes four levels of <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> that move from being a simple description of anthropogenic activity to more precisely describing the actual pressure on the ecosystem and its components, but which require increasingly more information to be quantified. We use {{the example of the}} Dutch beam trawl fleet in the North Sea to compare these <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> as the level of information used is increased. The first level is that of fleet capacity (e. g. number of vessels), the second is fishing effort, usually expressed as the number of hours fishing or days at sea, the third incorporates fishing parameters such as the proportion of time actually spent fishing, fishing speed, or gear characteristics, e. g. the size of the beam trawl {{in order to determine the}} frequency with which an area is fished, and at the fourth level, the most informative measure of fishing pressure, annual fishing mortality, is available for a few commercial species from stock assessments. For other species, it can be calculated from the lower level <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> through the incorporation of the chance of individuals of a species coming into contact with the fishing gear and the encounter mortality, which is the portion of mortality caused by the passing of the gear. Comparison of trends and absolute values shows that the <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> at different levels differ considerably in their description of both present and historical fishing impact in the North Sea. Therefore, for an EAFM, we advise using the highest level <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> that can be obtained with the data available...|$|R
