5|$|Major General Andrei Ravkov {{heads the}} Ministry of Defence, and Alexander Lukashenko (as president) serves as Commander-in-Chief. The armed forces were formed in 1992 using {{parts of the}} former Soviet Armed Forces on the new republic's territory. The {{transformation}} of the ex-Soviet <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> the Armed Forces of Belarus, which was completed in 1997, {{reduced the number of}} its soldiers by 30,000 and restructured its leadership and military formations.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 24 January the Archduke's army took {{positions}} east of {{the small town of}} Byczyna on the royal road leading into Poland. They felt secure in their camp, on the Habsburg side of the border, and did not expect the Poles to cross. Zamoyski marshaled his <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> three lines and was able to position them at an angle to the opponent's line.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> the city.|$|E

5|$|After {{the losses}} of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> western Tennessee, {{northern}} Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, {{the site of}} a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River.|$|E
5|$|As Gears of War 2 begins, the COG army is mobilizing to send <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> {{the depths}} of Sera to assault the Locust directly. The COG deploy several units into the Locust Tunnels, known as 'The Hollow', despite {{sustaining}} heavy casualties. Delta Squad, consisting of Marcus Fenix, Dom Santiago, Benjamin Carmine and later Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, continues to search the Hollow and discovers that the Locust are using a giant Riftworm to sink the human occupied cities. The Locust plan to destroy the rock structures at the outskirts of Jacinto, the last major Human city, in hopes of sinking it into the ground.|$|E
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} their <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's {{line was}} more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E

Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens {{to beat up}} Bart {{as soon as he}} is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name, but will not hold any actual power. Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty. Then, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails.|$|E
5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea {{with the intention of}} reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career Braham flew around the World. But, in 1968, Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> one unified service. Worse still, the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow put an end to Canada's plan to build their own fighters which curbed Braham's ambitions as a test pilot. He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons. He had flown 5,370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{established}} the Territorial Force, which replaced the outdated and recently disbanded Volunteer Force. He organised {{the structure of}} the New Zealand Military <b>Forces</b> <b>into</b> four military districts, with each district to be capable of raising an infantry and a mounted brigade. The districts had a specified number of battalions and regiments organised {{along the lines of the}} British Army. He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps to train and administer the Territorial Force. The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine-guns.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, Kenney was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Seventh Air Forces. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas, each for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not like it and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special <b>Forces</b> <b>into</b> Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E

On 10 August the 13th Tank Division was disbanded {{as a result of}} heavy losses it had suffered in the pas month of fighting. The corps was disbanded on or around 24 August 1941 due to the Soviet reorganization of their mechanised <b>forces</b> <b>into</b> smaller units. The 17th Tank Division was converted into a tank brigade days later.|$|E
