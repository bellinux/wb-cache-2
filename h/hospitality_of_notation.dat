50|$|In mathematics, abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> {{occurs when}} an author uses a {{mathematical}} notation {{in a way}} that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct intuition (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> may be made formally correct by improving the theory. Abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> should be contrasted with misuse <b>of</b> <b>notation,</b> which should be avoided.|$|R
