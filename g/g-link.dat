30|$|The Landesman-Lazer-type {{conditions}} were introduced by Landesman and Lazer in [3], where {{they considered the}} existence of weak solutions for the resonant elliptic problems, and then were widely used and extended (see [1 – 10] and their references). For nonlinear elliptic systems, let F_s(x,s,t)=g_ 1 (s), F_t(x,s,t)=g_ 2 (t) and by using the some Landesman-Lazer-type conditions, Zographopoulos in [1] proved the existence of weak solutions for problem (1) at resonance with the first eigenvalue λ_ 1, and by using the Landesman-Lazer-type conditions due to Tang and the <b>G-linking</b> theorem, Ou and Tang in [2] proved the existence of weak solutions for problem (1) at resonance with the higher eigenvalues of problem (3). When p= 2, Silva in [10] introduced the new Landesman-Lazer-type conditions and proved the existence of weak solutions for problem (1) by using variational methods, Morse theory and critical groups.|$|R
30|$|Costa and Magalhaés [2] {{have proved}} the {{existence}} of a weak solution for the semilinear elliptic equation under the nonquadraticity conditions and the asymptotic noncrossing conditions by using the saddle point theorem by Rabinowitz (see [17]) and {{the existence of}} a nontrivial solution under the nonquadraticity conditions and the crossing condition by using the linking theorem by Rabinowitz (see [17]). As for the quasilinear elliptic equation, by using an abstract critical point theory, El Amrouss and Moussaoui in [6] proved the same result with Theorem  2 with k= 1. Ou and Li in [8] obtained the same result with Theorem  1 by using the <b>G-linking</b> theorem, where the eigenvalues of -Δ_p are defined by the cogenus. In [9] Yuan and Ou proved the same conclusions as in [2] by using the linking theorem over cones by Degiovanni and Lancelotti (see [18]), where the eigenvalues of -Δ_p are defined by the Z_ 2 -cohomological index. However, as for the (p,q)-elliptic systems, because the functional ϕ(u,v), φ(u,v) are (p,q)-homogeneous, the eigenfunction space corresponding to the eigenvalue λ_k (k≥ 1) of problem (5) is not a cone. Hence the linking theorem over cones cannot be applied to prove our theorems and we must prove a new linking theorem on the product space W^ 1,p_ 0 (Ω)× W^ 1,q_ 0 (Ω) (see Lemma  3).|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of a <b>G-Link</b> {{wireless}} accelerometer (manufacturer: Microstain, Inc.) was examined. The {{objective was}} to determine if <b>G-Link</b> could be a viable tool {{in the study of the}} effects of dynamic loads on structures such as buildings, dams, and bridges. Generally, wired accelerometers are used to monitor and take the necessary measurements for these types of structures. Wired sensors, depending on their locations, might require very long set of cables that can be routed around obstacles. In addition, as the number of sensors grows, so does the complexity for instrumentation. For this project, characteristics of a <b>G-Link,</b> wireless force-balance accelerometer were compared to those of SA- 107, wired force-balance accelerometer (manufacturer: Columbia Research Labs, Inc.). Additional tests were performed on the <b>G-Link</b> sensor to determine its wireless capabilities in real time.

Increased energy of the beam particles leads to a small but significant increase in speed, reducing {{the time it takes to}} complete a full turn of the ring by 61 nanoseconds (or more than 3 rf buckets). In contrast, the reference signal, used to trigger instrumentation and transmitted over a cable, has a constant group delay. This difference leads to a phase slip during the ramp and prevents instrumentation such as dampers from properly operating without additional measures. The Synchronous Timing System corrects for this phase slip as well as signal propagation time changes due to temperature variations.

SONET 2. 488 -Gbit/s transmission and switching systems, network back-bones, and video transmission are among the many applications benefiting from inexpensive and robust clock and data recovery circuits. Clock and data recovery circuits are used in high-speed communications systems, typically long-span, single-mode fiber-optic links. Their job is to regenerate clean clock and data signals from arbitrary scrambled data inputs that have been corrupted by jitter and intersymbol interference. To provide highly reliable clock and data recovery for 2. 488 -Gbit/s SONET data transmission, the HP CDR 2500 clock and data recovery circuit has been developed.
