40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{clustering}} alphabet symbols before PDFA inference is performed reduces perplexity on new data. This result is especially important in real tasks, such as spoken language interfaces, in which data sparseness is a s <b>ignificant</b> <b>issue.</b> We describe {{the application of the}} ALERGIA algorithm combined with an independent clustering technique to the Air Travel Information System (A TIS) task. A 25 % reduction in perplexity was obtained. This result outperforms a trigram model under the same simple smoothing scheme...|$|E
