40|$|Accurate {{numerical}} calculation of stresses in structures with {{a multitude of}} spot joints {{continues to be a}} challenge, especially if local stresses are located in the area of joining positions or if crack endangerment needs to be addressed. In addition to inadequate FE modelling, a major cause for this is the unavailability of exact primary data, which describe the properties of the joints. New methods for determining the stiffness behaviour of <b>joint</b> <b>connections</b> bases on the measurement of the relative displacement of the sheet metals between the joints during applying a load. The measured relative displacement is proportional to the deformations in the joint area.
