A great many of his anecdotal and autobiographical teaching stories were collected by Sidney Rosen in the book My Voice Will <b>Go</b> <b>With</b> <b>You.</b> Erickson identified many of his earliest personal experiences as hypnotic or autohypnotic.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E

500|$|... "Speak Now" [...] {{was written}} by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album. The song was {{inspired}} by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend. The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed. [...] "He had met this girl who's just this horrible, mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated," [...] said Swift. She asked her friend if she would [...] "speak now." [...] Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, [...] "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I'll play guitar. It'd be great." [...] Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} track features sharp {{criticism by}} Scott-Heron of then-US president Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew, among other politicians {{involved in the}} scandal; the Watergate incident had yet to reach its conclusion when the song was recorded. Scott-Heron introduces the song with a short speech discussing the blues and referencing current events: [...] "But lately we had Frank Rizzo with the 'Lie Detector Blues'/We done had the United States government talkin bout the 'Energy Crisis Blues'". The final chorus line directly references Nixon and the scandal: [...] "And {{there are those who}} swear that've seen King Richard/Beneath that cesspool–Watergate". His lyrics range from humor to critical diatribes of political corruption and social issues. It shares lyrical similarities to Stevie Wonder's anti-Nixon song [...] "You Haven't Done Nothin'" [...] (1974). The album concludes with a reprisal of the opening track. Music writer Karl Keely said of its significance, [...] "The return of the refrain from 'Peace <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> Brother' adds a sense of wholeness to end the record, an idea that the album has travelled through Gil Scott-Heron's worries, fears, pleasures, hopes, and finally, his pronounced disliking of Richard Nixon, before returning to the opening statement, in the hopes that the record may have made that selfish brother think more about his world and those in it, instead of moving along in a self-imposed bubble." ...|$|E

There is a clear rule. Not a citizen outside the United States; you don't get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact.

2500|$|Summer {{earned a}} total of 32 hit singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in her lifetime, with 14 of those {{reaching}} the top ten.
