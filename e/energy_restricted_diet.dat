The food Stablor®, a drink preparation with defined macro- and micronutrient composition and a specific proportion of amino acids (tryptophan to neutral amino acids ratio) which is the subject of the health claim, is sufficiently characterised. The Panel considers that reduction of visceral fat while maintaining lean body mass {{in the context of an}} <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> is a beneficial physiological effect in overweight or obese subjects with abdominal fat and cardiometabolic risk factors. Four human studies were submitted by the applicant as pertinent to the claimed effect. In weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that one human study from which conclusions could be drawn for scientific substantiation of the claimed effect did not show an effect of Stablor® on visceral fat mass in the context of an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet.</b> The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of Stablor® and reduction of visceral fat while maintaining lean body mass in the context of an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet...</b>|$|E

40|$|Inclusion of almonds in an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to enhance or have no effect on weight loss. Their effects specifically on visceral fat stores during energy restriction have not been widely examined. Additionally, almond consumption has been associated with reduced blood pressure, but whether this is linked to or is independent of changes of body composition has not been examined. Moreover, almond consumption during energy restriction may be an effective strategy for reversing the negative effects of dieting on cognitive performance. The unique nutrient profile of almonds also has the potential to influence cognitive function post-prandially. The post-lunch dip in cognition is a well-established phenomenon of decreased alertness, memory and vigilance after lunch consumption and can be affected by lunch composition. Almonds which are higher in fat and lower in carbohydrate may be able to reduce this post lunch dip in cognition. Consequently, this dissertation had three primary aims. The first aim was to evaluate the effects of almond consumption as part of an energy-restricted diet on weight, visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots and blood pressure compared to a nut-free <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet.</b> The second aim was to evaluate the effects of almond consumption as part of an energy-restricted diet on cognitive function. The third aim was to evaluate the acute effects of almond consumption on the post-lunch dip in cognitive function. A secondary objective of this dissertation was to develop an analytical approach to identify metabolic profiles associated with almond consumption to ascertain compliance in long term clinical trials.

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the effectiveness of}} diet interventions by systematic review of {{the long-term effects of}} <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> in individuals with overweight and obesity. A systematic literature search was conducted for all clinical trials studying the effect of <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> on body weight in individuals with a BMI> 25 kg/m(2) with a follow-up of at least 3 years and a minimum of 50 participants. Weight change from baseline and rates of loss to follow-up at the longest follow-up were extracted and analyzed using random-effects models. Weighted mean weight loss after 3 years follow-up was 3. 5 % (95 % CI 0. 2 - 6. 8 %) (n[*]=[*] 6, 163) and after 4 years follow-up 4. 5 % (95 % CI 4. 3 - 4. 8 %) (n[*]=[*] 5, 696). <b>Energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> (n[*]=[*] 1, 433) resulted in an average 2. 9 % (95 % CI - 3. 8 to - 2. 1 %) greater weight loss compared to untreated control groups (n[*]=[*] 1, 361).

Despite these changes CVD is still {{the leading cause of}} deaths in Norway as globally and there is a great potential for further improvements in cardiovascular risk factors by lifestyle changes as more healthy diets. We report data from three randomized clinical trials. The examined interventions were plant sterol enriched margarines and fat- or carbohydrate-restricted diets to reduce weight. Margarines providing 2 g/day of sterols from rapeseed or tall oil resulted in similar reductions in LDL cholesterol and Apo B. The margarine with sterols from rapeseed oil seemed to improve some markers of endothelial function (E-selectin) and hemostasis (PAI- 1). In overweight and obese men and women <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> low in carbohydrate or low in fat giving a mean weight loss of < 5 %, similarly improved inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. Serum concentrations of IL- 6, TNF-α, PAI- 1, and leptin were reduced in both dietary groups, resistin was only reduced in the low-fat group. <b>Energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> low in carbohydrate or fat did not differ in effects on body weight, fat mass or body circumferences in overweight and obese smokers trying to quit, but the low carbohydrate diet group reported higher withdrawal symptoms. The diets seemed to ameliorate early weight gain without decreasing quit rates. Quitters had a decrease in resting metabolic rate of 3. 9 % after 4 weeks, no increase in weight and improvement in triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure after 12 weeks.

Few of these studies were able to control for potentially confounding variables. Test meals differ widely in physical and sensory properties so it cannot be concluded that it is protein conferring these effects. When sensory properties are controlled up to 10 - 30 % more calories are eaten at a subsequent meal with a high carbohydrate liquid meal than a high protein liquid meal with no difference in protein sources or BMI status. Weight loss studies examining the metabolic effects of isocaloric high protein <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> with high carbohydrate structured diets have not shown differences in kilojoule intake and weight loss despite expected satiety differences.

The basal and post-stroke levels of neurotrophic factors (BDNF and bFGF), protein chaperones (HSP 70 and GRP 78) and the antioxidant enzyme HO- 1 were decreased, while levels of inflammatory cytokines were increased in the cerebral cortex and striatum of old mice compared to younger mice. IF coordinately increased levels of protective proteins and decreases inflammatory cytokines in young, but not in old mice.

METHOD: The focus is on an objective approach that is, activity associated energy expenditure as measured with doubly labelled water. RESULTS: Activity associated energy expenditure increases with body mass index while the average physical activity level does not change. The majority of obese subjects is moderately active. An increase in the activity level of obese subjects is limited by the ability to perform exercise of higher intensity.

During {{the course of this}} study, body weight, energy intake and plasma peptide YY (PYY) were measured. The study revealed that the replacement of a high-fat diet with a low-fat diet was associated with a significant lowering of ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) Y 2 receptor binding in both the DIO-L and DR-L mice (- 37 %, - 36 %), and also a lowered plasma PYY level in the DIO-L mice (- 25 %).

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim was to investigate the antioxidant capacity of different <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> in the treatment of obesity, paying emphasis to the effect of incorporating omega- 3 fatty acids with or without other seafood components. METHODS: The study was a randomized 8 -weeks parallel intervention trial prescribed to lose weight, which was implemented in 276 subjects aged 31. 4 +/- 5. 4 y. o. following four different balanced hypocaloric diets (TEE- 30 %) : fish-restricted (control), cod and salmon based diets and DHA+EPA supplemented administration. At baseline (day 0) {{and at the end of}} the trial (day 56), anthropometry, dietary intake, erythrocyte membrane fatty acid content, circulating malondialdehyde (MDA) and plasma antioxidant status (AOP) were determined. RESULTS: Overall, percent weight loss was - 5. 8 +/- 3. 2 % (P < 0. 001) and the AOP statistically increased after the energy restriction period (P = 0. 015), basically due to the seafood-based diets. In contrast, MDA statistically only decreased (P = 0. 026) after the cod-based diet intake with no changes after the other nutritional treatments. In fact, the cod-based intervention statistically decreased oxidative stress when expressed as the MDA/AOP ratio (P = 0. 006). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate calorie-restricted cod-based diet was found as a useful strategy to lose weight, which was accompanied by a specific improvement on oxidative stress markers.

40|$|Obesity is {{commonly}} associated with high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Weight loss in obese subjects reduces risk factors for CVD but this response is not uniform. Genetic factors could {{be involved in this}} variability. The 360 His polymorphism of apolipoproteinA-IV (apoA-IV) influences the lipid response to fat intake, but it is unclear whether this polymorphism could contribute to lipid variability during weight loss. Therefore, we assessed the effects of an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> (6. 3 MJ) for 12 weeks on weight loss and plasma lipids according to apoA-IV genotype in 186 overweight/obese subjects (BMI mean 33 +/- 4. 3, range 25. 0 - 48. 0 kg/m(2)). The frequency of the 360 His allele was 0. 083. Energy restriction for 12 weeks resulted in an average weight loss of 8. 25 +/- 0. 28 kg. HDL-C increased 5. 4 % in subjects with the apoA-IV- 1 / 1 genotype with weight loss compared to a 2. 6 % decrease in apoA-IV- 1 / 2 subjects (P= 0. 035). This was more apparent when only the subjects with type 2 diabetes (n= 57) were analyzed (P= 0. 003). ApoA-IV genotype was not related to change in total cholesterol, LDL-C or triglyceride concentrations. Therefore, weight loss as a treatment to reduce CVD risk factors may be more effective in subjects with the apoA-IV- 1 / 1 variant as compared to those with the apoA-IV- 1 / 2 variant, especially in subjects with type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Cílem naší studie bylo posoudit vliv dvou typů redukčních programů na změny klidového energetického výdeje (REE) u skupiny žen středního věku s nadměrnou hmotností. Intervenčních programů se zúčastnilo 28 asymptomatických žen ve věku 40 – 50 let s nadváhou či obezitou, 6 žen studii nedokončilo. Soubor byl rozdělen na 2 skupiny – D a DE. Ženy zařazené do skupiny D (n = 10) měly předepsanou pouze dietní intervenci a ve skupině DE (n = 12) kombinovaný program dietní a pohybové intervence. Dietní program byl v obou skupinách stejný a denní energetická restrikce činila pro každého jedince přibližně 2000 kJ. Ve skupině s pohybovou intervencí byla zvolená kombinace silového a aerobního tréninku. Oba programy trvaly 6 týdnů. Na počátku a konci intervence jsme sledovali hodnoty REE (nepřímou kalorimetrií), REE/kg a vybrané antropometrické parametry: tělesnou hmotnost, výšku, BMI, obvod pasu, boků a stehna a procento tělesného tuku. Ve skupině s kombinovaným intervenčním programem byl pokles REE menší než ve skupině s pouhou dietní restrikcí. Změny REE a REE/kg na konci sledovaného období však nebyly statisticky významné a nebyl zjištěn statisticky významný rozdíl ani mezi použitými intervenčními programy. Rozdílné intervenční programy rovněž neměly, kromě obvodu stehna, statisticky významně rozdílný vliv na změnu sledovaných antropometrických ukazatelů. Ve všech sledovaných parametrech (REE i antropometrických) můžeme však pozorovat tendenci efektivnějšího působení kombinace redukční diety a cvičení než samotné diety. Pro výraznější ovlivnění REE by bylo patrně zapotřebí použití předpisu pohybové aktivity s delším trváním, vyšší intenzitou a frekvencí cvičení. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effects of two types of weight {{reducing}} programs on changes in resting energy expenditure (REE) in overweight middle aged women. We recruited 28 overweight or obese premenopausal women at the age of 40 – 50 years via poster advertisements, of which 6 of the women were withdrawn early. Participants were divided into 2 groups – D and DC. Women assigned to group D (n = 10) had only a diet regime prescribed, whereas group DC (n = 12) followed a combined diet and exercise intervention. The diet was identical for both groups and the daily energy restriction for each participant was approximately 2000 kJ. Group DC combined resistance training and aerobic exercise. Both programs ran for 6 weeks. At the beginning and end of the intervention REE values (measured by indirect calorimetry), REE/kg and selected anthropometric parameters: body weight, stature, BMI, waist, hips and thigh girth, and body fat percentage were monitored. In the combined intervention program the REE decrease was smaller than in the group with only an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet.</b> However, the REE and REE/kg changes detected at the end of the monitored period were not statistically signifi cant, and there was no significant statistical difference between the applied intervention programs. Apart from the thigh circumference, the two intervention programs did not show different effects of any statistical significance on the change of monitored anthropometric indices. However, for all the parameters monitored (REE as well as the anthropometric ones) we can see that <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> combined with exercise is more effective than diet alone. To affect the REE more markedly, prescription of physical exercise of longer duration, and of greater intensity and frequency would be necessary...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis investigated dietary strategies to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The thesis also describes {{the development of a}} new method for the separation of the principal HDL subclasses. The 'RISCK' study five examined the effects of five diets, differing in the type and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrate, on plasma lipids in subjects at risk of developing metabolic syndrome. All diets showed a significant reduction in serum total, and LDL cholesterol. Whilst no diet was superior in its lipid-lowering effect, the two low fat diets reduced waist circumference and other CV risk factors, suggesting a link between a reduction in visceral adiposity and CV risk The 'EDWINA' study addressed the effects of energy restriction and increased dietary cholesterol in the form of eggs, on body weight and plasma lipids. Energy restriction and energy restriction + 2 eggs/day for 12 weeks achieved significant weight loss (3 - 4 kg). Increased egg consumption had no significant effect on plasma LDL cholesterol, suggesting that weight loss negates the cholesterol raising potential of dietary cholesterol. The weight loss and lipid response in the 'EDWINA' study was highly variable between subjects. Apo E genotype and serum non-cholesterol sterols (markers of cholesterol homeostasis) were measured to investigate the origin of this variability. Carriage of the epsilon 4 allele was significantly associated with higher serum sitosterol (marker of cholesterol absorption) at baseline, however, apoE genotype did not explain the heterogeneity in response to diet. There was some indication from reductions in serum lathosterol, that falls in plasma cholesterol were associated with reduced cholesterol biosynthesis. The overall findings provide further evidence to support the CV health benefits of losing weight and especially visceral adiposity. They also highlighted the importance of dietary composition of <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> in modifying lipid mediated CV risk...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: A {{meta-analysis}} of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) {{was performed to}} investigate the effects of dairy food or supplements during energy restriction on body weight and composition in 18 – 50 -year-old. Methods: RCTs ≥ 4 weeks comparing the effect of dairy consumption (whole food or supplements) with control diets lower in dairy during energy restriction on body weight, fat and lean mass were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane Central and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) until March 2016. Reports were identified and critically appraised in duplicate. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Chi 2 - and I 2 -statistics indicated heterogeneity. Dose effect was assessed using meta-regression analysis. GRADE guidelines were used to rate the quality (QR) of the evidence considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias and effect estimates. Results: 27 RCTs were reviewed. Participants consumed between 2 and 4 standard servings/day of dairy food or 20 – 84 g/day of whey protein compared to low dairy control diets, over a median of 16 weeks. A greater reduction in body weight (− 1. 16 kg [− 1. 66, − 0. 66 kg], p < 0. 001, I 2 = 11 %, QR = high, n = 644) and body fat mass (− 1. 49 kg [− 2. 06, − 0. 92 kg], p < 0. 001, I 2 = 21 %, n = 521, QR = high) were found in studies largely including women (90 % women). These effects were absent in studies that imposed resistance training (QR = low-moderate). Dairy intake resulted in smaller loss of lean mass (all trials pooled: 0. 36 kg [0. 01, 0. 71 kg], p = 0. 04, I 2 = 64 %, n = 651, QR = moderate). No between study dose-response effects were seen. Conclusions: Increased dairy intake as part of <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diets</b> resulted in greater loss in bodyweight and fat mass while attenuating lean mass loss in 18 – 50 -year-old adults.

40|$|Supplementary data {{associated}} with this article {{can be found in}} the online versionThe hypothesis that n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction aiming to weight loss was tested in the rat, with special attention paid to insulin signalling. After 10 weeks on a diet rich in lipids and sucrose, male rats were <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> and fed <b>diets</b> rich in 18 : 1 n- 9 (OLE), 18 : 3 n- 3 (ALA) or n- 3 long-chain (LC, > 18 carbons) PUFA. After 4 weeks, they were killed after an insulin injection. Red blood cells, liver, and Gastrocnemius muscle were enriched in ALA in the ALA group, and in LC-PUFA in the ALA and LC groups. The LC diet resulted in a higher weight loss, without negative impact on the muscle weight. In parallel, hepatic phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS 1 was the highest in this group. This suggests that the trend we observed in the preservation of protein homeostasis in the LC group is mediated, at least partly, by an enhancement of the early steps of insulin signalling resulting from cell membrane enrichment in n- 3 PUFA...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sustainability {{of healthy}} {{lifestyle}} behaviours following {{participation in a}} research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme is often poor. This study aimed to document factors reported by overweight and obese individuals with Type 2 diabetes as enhancing or impeding sustainability of lifestyle behaviours following participation in such a programme. METHODS: Thirty patients who completed a 16 -week research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme, incorporating a structured <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> with or without supervised resistance-exercise training underwent a semistructured qualitative interview about their experiences in maintaining programme components after 1 year. RESULTS: Participants maintained 8. 8 - 8. 9 kg of the 13. 9 - 6. 6 kg weight loss achieved with the research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme. Only 23 %of participants indicated continuation of the complete diet programme. Desire for ‘variety’ (33 %) and increased portion size (27 %) were the most commonly reported reasons for discontinuation. Participants who undertook supervised exercise training during the programme indicated access to appropriate programmes/ facilities (38 %), more affordable gym membership (21 %) and having a personal trainer/motivator (17 %) would have facilitated exercise continuation. CONCLUSION: In overweight and obese individuals with Type 2 diabetes, success of the research-based supervised lifestyle intervention programme was perceived as being primarily due {{to high levels of}} professional support and supervision, the discontinuation of which subsequently presented difficulties. The interview data provide insight into what people experience following the completion of a research-based intensive lifestyle intervention programme and suggest that programmes assembled for research purposes with the emphasis on compliance may not necessarily promote sustainable change.

40|$|Background: Obesity and {{diabetes}} {{are the most}} important problems of public health. Evidence from molecular animal research and epidemiologic investigations indicate that calcium intake may have an influence on body composition, weight and insulin resistance. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of calcium supplementation on body composition, weight, insulin resistance and blood pressure in the face of calorie restriction in obese adults. Methods: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on 40 adults with Body Mass Index > 25 kg/m 2 was conducted. Subjects were maintained for 24 weeks on a balanced deficit diet (- 500 kcal/d deficit) and randomly assigned into two groups with 1000 mg ca/d as calcium carbonate or placebo. Results: There were no significant differences in variables at the 12 th and 24 th week between the two groups. The lean mass showed no significant increase in the calcium group at the 12 th week compared to baseline and in placebo group at the 24 th week compared to the 12 th week. The insulin concentration showed a significant decrease in the calcium group at the 12 th week compared to the baseline (p < 0. 05). The diastolic blood pressure had a significant decrease at the 24 th week compared to the 12 th week in both groups (p = 0. 013 - 0. 009). Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that 24 weeks of supplementation with 1000 mg ca/d did not have any effect on weight, body composition, insulin resistance and blood pressure beyond what can be achieved in an <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet</b> in obese adults...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rising {{prevalence}} of type- 2 diabetes {{is becoming a}} pressing issue based on emerging reports that T 2 DM can also adversely impact mental health. We have utilized the UCD-T 2 DM rat model in which the onset of T 2 DM develops spontaneously across time and can serve to understand the pathophysiology of diabetes in humans. An increased insulin resistance index and plasma glucose levels manifested the onset of T 2 DM. There was a decrease in hippocampal insulin receptor signaling in the hippocampus, which correlated with peripheral insulin resistance index along the course of diabetes onset (r=− 0. 56, p< 0. 01). T 2 DM increased the hippocampal levels of 4 -hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE; a marker of lipid peroxidation) in inverse proportion to {{the changes in the}} mitochondrial regulator PGC- 1 α. Disrupted energy homeostasis was further manifested by a concurrent reduction in energy metabolic markers, including TFAM, SIRT 1, and AMPK phosphorylation. In addition, T 2 DM influenced brain plasticity as evidenced by a significant reduction of BDNF–TrkB signaling. These results suggest that the pathology of T 2 DM in the brain involves a progressive and coordinated disruption of insulin signaling, and energy homeostasis, with profound consequences for brain function and plasticity. All the described consequences of T 2 DM were attenuated by treatment with the glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonist, liraglutide. Similar results to those of liraglutide were obtained by exposing T 2 DM rats to a food <b>energy</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>diet,</b> which suggest that normalization of brain energy metabolism is a crucial factor to counteract central insulin sensitivity and synaptic plasticity associated with T 2 DM...|$|E
40|$|The current {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the efficacy of adding the multi-enzyme mixture (Natuzyme) into layers’ diets with different levels of energy and available phosphorus in relation to laying performance, egg qualities, blood cholesterol level, microflora and intestinal viscosity. Two hundred and fifty 43 -wk-old Hy-Line commercial layers were divided into five groups with five replicates per group (10 birds per replicate) and fed one of five experimental diets. A corn and soybean meal-based control diet was formulated and used as a control diet. Two experimental control diets were formulated to reduce energy and crude protein contents (rE) or energy, crude protein and phosphorus contents (rEP). In addition, Natuzyme was added into either rE (rE-Natu 500) or rEP (rEP-Natu 500) diet to reach a concentration of 500 mg per kg of diet. The experiment lasted 8 weeks. There {{were no significant differences}} in feed intake, egg production, egg weight, egg qualities such as eggshell color or Haugh unit, total cholesterol, relative organ weights and cecal microflora profiles between any dietary treatments. Natu 500 supplementation into the rE diet, but not rEP diet significantly increased egg mass and eggshell qualities such as strength and thickness, but it decreased cecal ammonia concentration and intestinal viscosity in laying hens. In conclusion, the present study shows that adding multiple enzyme preparation could improve performance of laying hens fed <b>energy</b> and protein <b>restricted</b> <b>diets...</b>|$|R
