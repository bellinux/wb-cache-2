Wilson put on 25lbs. {{to play the}} overweight Dreiberg. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> Dreiberg to a soldier who returns from war unable to fit into society. Both Joaquin Phoenix and John Cusack (another fan of the novel) were involved in previous attempts at making the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 Georg Brandes {{compared}} Either/Or with Frederik Paludan-Müller's Kalanus in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century, {{which was}} translated into English at that time. Later, in 1906, <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> Kierkegaard's Diary of the Seducer with Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise and with Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther. He also compared Either/Or to Henrik Ibsen's Brand but Edmund Gosse disagreed with him.|$|E
5|$|In game development, he is {{a co-founder}} of Action Button Entertainment, where he {{designed}} games including Ziggurat and Videoball. The four-person studio specializes in simple aesthetics and controls, following from Rogers's own video game aesthetic and minimalist eSports interests. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> the studio's design philosophy to the spartan menu selections of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.|$|E

5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> Peter to Homer Simpson and <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|Several critics however, {{were more}} {{enthusiastic}} about the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation.|$|E
5|$|The Bishop of Meath, John Evans, {{agreed with}} Lord Orrery's {{critique}} of the sermons as political works, and <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> a sermon to the writing of Montaigne.|$|E

5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

5000|$|Specialists in the Uralic {{languages}} {{have generally}} rejected Sadovszsky's theory, citing {{general lack of}} understanding of the methods of comparative linguistics, leading to his work being riddled with problems such as poor semantic and phonetic correspondences. Sadovszky often makes no effort to show that some material <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> is truly native within the two language groups <b>he</b> <b>compares,</b> often cherrypicking examples from just {{one or two of the}} dozens of languages encompassed by [...] "Penutian".|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>compares</b> {{the cruelty}} of the Aztec priests to {{the cruelty of}} the Roman Catholic Inquisition, both {{examples}} of the evils of superstition.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented with ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Näslund {{was drafted}} 16th {{overall in the}} 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team's general manager, Craig Patrick, hailed Näslund and Forsberg as the draft's top two {{prospects}} behind first-overall selection Eric Lindros. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings' Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, {{although he did not}} consider him as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he was a more natural goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{access to}} life outside the clinic {{resulted}} in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.|$|E
50|$|James Wright also {{published}} Country Conversations (1694), in which <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> late seventeenth-century theatre to earlier theatre by Shakespeare, Jonson, Massinger, and others.|$|R

5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Andrew Davies {{said he was}} {{attracted}} to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> it to Pride and Prejudice—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—"with dirty bits". Both Waters and Davies {{were concerned about the}} use of dildos in scenes with Diana, but the BBC allowed it. When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys, the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest. BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story, comparing it to Moll Flanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{critic and}} screenwriter Saeroen, writing for Pemandangan, praised Kedok Ketawa, {{especially}} its cinematography {{and the beauty}} of its scenery; <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> the film to imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this was a first production. Another review, in Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} evening Djorgovski again {{observed the}} region. <b>He</b> <b>compared</b> the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May8 and May9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he {{assumed it was}} a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow. Titus Galama and Paul Groot, members of a research team in Amsterdam led by Jan van Paradijs, compared images taken by the WIYN Telescope on May8 and the William Herschel Telescope on May9. They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time.|$|E
5|$|When the 1931 season started, {{many critics}} and journalists watched Verity closely {{to see how}} <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> to Rhodes. Their initial {{impressions}} were favourable as Verity took five for 42 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Yorkshire's first match {{of the season and}} five for 42 against Cambridge University. Then, in his fifth game, Verity became only the second man, after Alonzo Drake, to take all 10 wickets in a single innings for Yorkshire. Against Warwickshire, on his 26th birthday, Verity took 10 for 36 in the second innings, having taken three wickets in the first innings, to give Yorkshire an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E

Then <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> her face with the fine sculpture of Sravasti. Then the traveller-narrator recollects that {{when he saw her}} in the shadow it was like a mariner whose ship was wrecked in a faraway sea spotting verdant land among barren islands. In the first encounter Banalata Sen, raising her comforting eyes, inquires of him, “Where had you been lost all these days?” ...|$|R
