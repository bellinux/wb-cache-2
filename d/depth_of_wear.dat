40|$|Abstract- Hydrodynamic Cu-Pb-Sn journal {{bearings}} {{are considered to}} be a vital component of all the rotating machinery, because of its simplicity, low cost and efficiency. It is used to support radial loads under high speed operating conditions. During this transient period, direct contact between the journal and bearing induces high friction and bushes become progressively worn-out, thus inducting certain disabilities. The bushes are provided with a lining thickness of Cu-Pb-Sn material which is found in the range of 450 to 600 micron. The aim of present experimental work is to determine effect of variable load, speed and acceleration on <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> of lining thickness (dw) of Cu-Pb-Sn material bush, which is widely used as bush material in automobile engine. Taguchi L 9 (3 3) orthogonal array was used for the experimental plan [...] The mathematical model for input parameters and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> obtained from regression analysis to predict values of <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear.</b> S/N ratio and ANOVA analysis were used to obtained significant parameters influencing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear.</b> Test rig for testing dynamic behavior of bush bearing indigenously designed and developed by us...|$|E

40|$|Although {{modularity}} affords various {{options to}} the orthopedic surgeon, these benefits {{come at a}} price. The unintended bearing surface between the back surface of the tibial insert and the metallic tray results in micromotion leading to polyethylene wear debris. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the backside wear of tibial inserts from three modern total knee designs with very different locking mechanisms: Insall-Burstein II® (IB II®), Optetrak®, and Advance®. A random sample of 71 inserts were obtained from our institution’s retrieval collection and examined to assess the extent of wear, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> and wear damage modes. Patient records were also obtained to determine patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and reason for revision. Modes of wear damage (abrasion, burnishing, scratching, delamination, third body debris, surface deformation, and pitting) were then scored in each zone from 0 to 3 (0 [*]=[*] 0 %, 1 [*]=[*] 0 – 10 %, 2 [*]=[*] 10 – 50 %, and 3 [*]=[*]> 50 %). The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> was subjectively identified as removal of manufacturing identification markings stamped onto the inferior surface of the polyethylene. Both Advance® and IB II® polyethylene inserts showed significantly higher scores for backside wear than the Optetrak® inserts. All IB II® and Advance® implants showed evidence of backside wear, whereas 17 % (5 out of 30) of the retrieved Optetrak® implants had no observable wear. There were no significant differences when comparing the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> score between designs. The locking mechanism greatly affects the propensity for wear and should be considered when choosing a knee implant system...|$|E
40|$|Total {{replacement}} of the glenohumeral joint provides an effective means for treating a variety of pathologies of the shoulder. However, several studies indicate that the procedure {{has not yet been}} entirely optimized. Loosening of the glenoid component remains the most likely cause of implant failure, and generally this is believed to stem from either mechanical failure of the fixation in response to high tensile stresses, or through osteolysis of the surrounding bone stock in response to particulate wear debris. Many computational studies have considered the potential for the former, although only few have attempted to tackle the latter. Using finite-element analysis an investigation, taking into account contact pressures as well as glenohumeral kinematics, has thus been conducted, to assess the potential for polyethylene wear within the artificial shoulder. The relationships between three different aspects of glenohumeral design and the potential for wear have been considered, these being conformity, polyethylene thickness, and fixation type. The results of the current study indicate that the use of conforming designs are likely to produce slightly elevated amounts <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> debris particles when compared with less conforming joints, but that the latter {{would be more likely to}} cause material failure of the polyethylene. The volume <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> debris predicted was highly influenced by the rate of loading, however qualitatively it was found that wear predictions were not influenced by the use of different polyethylene thicknesses nor fixation type while the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wearing</b> was. With the thinnest polyethylene designs 2 mm the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> scar was seen to be upwards of 20 % higher with a metal-backed fixation as opposed to a cemented design. In all-polyethylene designs peak polymethyl methacrylate tensile stresses were seen to reduce with increasing polyethylene thickness. Irrespective of the rate of loading of the shoulder joint, the current study indicates that it is possible to optimize glenoid component design against abrasive wear through the use of high conformity designs, possessing a polyethylene thickness of at least 6 mm...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the present in situ study was to evaluate the influence of dental plaque on human enamel erosion. Materials and Methods: Thirteen volunteers wore acrylic palatal devices with four enamel specimens that were prepared from freshly extracted impacted human third permanent molars (4 x 4 mm), randomly selected and distributed into two vertical rows, corresponding to the following groups: GI, erosion of dental plaque-free samples, and GII, erosion of dental plaque-covered samples. For the formation of dental plaque, the specimens were placed 1 mm {{below the level of}} the appliance and covered with a plastic mesh to allow the accumulation of dental plaque. The palatal device was continuously worn by the volunteers for 14 consecutive days and then immersed in a soft drink (Coca-Cola (R), 150 ml) for 5 min, three times a day. Half of the surfaces of specimens were coated with nail varnish for profilometry tests. The study variables included the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> enamel surface <b>wear</b> (profilometer, vertical ranges in pm) and the percentage of superficial microhardness change (%SMHC). Data were analysed using the t test (P < 0. 05). Results: The %SMHC and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> enamel surface <b>wear</b> were significantly higher for GI (- 87. 82 % +/- 3. 66 and 4. 70 mu m +/- 1. 65) than for GII (- 13. 79 % +/- 4. 22 and 0. 14 mu m +/- 0. 03). Conclusions: It was concluded that the dental plaque formed in situ was able to protect the enamel surface against erosion by a cola soft drink, thus reducing the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> enamel surface <b>wear</b> and the %SMHC.

40|$|Simulation <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> in {{artificial}} joint implants {{is critical}} for evaluating implant designs and materials. Traditional protocols employ the gravimetric method to determine the loss of material by measuring {{the weight of the}} implant components before and after various test intervals and after the completed test. However, the gravimetric method cannot identify the location, area coverage or maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> and it has difficulties with proportionally small weight changes in relatively heavy implants. In this study, we compare the gravimetric method with two geometric surface methods; an optical light method (RedLux) and a coordinate measuring method (CMM). We tested ten Adept hips in a simulator for 2 million cycles (MC). Gravimetric and optical methods were performed at 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00, 1. 33 and 2 MC. CMM measurements were done before and after the test. A high correlation was found between the gravimetric and optical methods for both heads (R 2 = 0. 997) and for cups (R 2 = 0. 96). Both geometric methods (optical and CMM) measured more volume loss than the gravimetric method (for the heads, p = 0. 004 (optical) and p = 0. 08 (CMM); for the cups p = 0. 01 (optical) and p = 0. 003 (CMM)). Two cups recorded negative wear at 2 MC by the gravimetric method but none did by either the optical method or by CMM. The geometric methods were prone to confounding factors such as surface deformation and the gravimetric method could be confounded by protein absorption and backside <b>wear.</b> Both <b>of</b> the geometric methods were able to show the location, area covered and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> on the bearing surfaces, and track their changes during the test run; providing significant advantages to solely using the gravimetric method...|$|R

The experimental results indicate that, under dry friction, galvanized sheets experience three stages: run-in wear, abrasive wear and adhesive wear. Meanwhile, zinc coatings exfoliate until they lose efficacy. Good lubrication is propitious to protect zinc coatings and it can reduce friction wear. The research results can provide guidance for formability analysis and mold design of galvanized sheets...|$|E

30|$|Intermediate casings in the build {{sections}} {{are subject}} to severe wear in extended-reach drilling. This paper presents a new method for predicting the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wear</b> groove on the intermediate casing. According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation <b>of</b> casing <b>wear</b> by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the wear groove depth and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} casing wear groove is crescent-shaped. The change <b>of</b> casing <b>wear</b> groove <b>depth</b> versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting casing wear location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The casing <b>wear</b> groove <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> a planned well is predicted with inversion <b>of</b> the casing <b>wear</b> factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting casing wear in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on casing wear should be taken into account in casing wear prediction.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the hardness and wear resistance of interim restorative materials. Materials and Methods: Fifteen identical rectangular shape specimens with dimensions of 2 mm × 10 mm × 30 mm were made from 7 interim materials (TempSpan, Protemp 3 Garant, Revotek, Unifast LC, Tempron, Duralay, and Acropars). The Vickers hardness and abrasive wear of specimens were tested in dry conditions and after 1 week storage in artificial saliva. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> was measured using surface roughness inspection device. Data were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between hardness and wear (α = 0. 05). Results: TempSpan had the highest hardness. The wear resistance of TempSpan (in dry condition) and Revotek (after conditioning in artificial saliva) was significantly higher (P < 0. 05). There was no statistically significant correlation between degree of wear and hardness of the materials (P = 0. 281, r = - 0. 31).

40|$|The {{technology}} of composite heat treatment is used popularly for low friction and wear resistance of drive elements. A {{large number of}} papers about the heat treatment technology had been proposed. Especially, the nitride treatment has been used widely {{for the purpose of}} wear resistance and low friction in the industry. Therefore, the self-developed vertical ball/disk friction tester with the measurement system was used to study the effects of nitride on the tribological properties of the low carbon alloy steel—SCM 415 — in this study. The experiments were conducted under dry and severe wear conditions. The variations of friction coefficient and surface magnetization were simultaneously recorded during dynamic friction process. After each test, the microstructures of the wear particles were observed and analyzed under a SEM, and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> track is measured by means of a surface tester. According to the experimental results, the wear resistance of the specimens with carburizing-nitride is significantly larger than the case of nitride-carburizing. Moreover, the surface magnetization was especially larger for the case of nitride-carburizing. As a result, the wear particles always stay in the interfaces and the wear mechanism becomes complex. Therefore, it is necessary to put nitride after carburizing for the composite heat treatments...|$|E

Composition, microstructures and mechanical {{properties of the}} as-deposited CrNx coatings were systematically investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), nano-indentation and scratch tester. The friction and wear properties of CrN,, coatings were investigated by a ball-on-disk tribometer in artificial seawater. The {{results showed that the}} coatings transformed from a mixture of Cr + Cr 2 N to single-phase Cr 2 N, and then Cr 2 N + CrN to pure CrN phase with the increase of N- 2 flow rate. The coatings were all dense except for the one deposited at 200 sccm, which clearly exhibited a typical columnar structure. With the increase of N- 2 flow rate, the friction coefficients first decreased to 0. 196 at 100 sccm then slightly increased to 0. 215 at 200 sccm in seawater. However, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> track and wear rate were lowest at 125 sccm, which could be attributed to the denser structure related to better corrosion resistance consisting of Cr 2 N and CrN phases.

Eight milling trials were executed under two cutting speeds, two feed rates, and two <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cuts. Cutting edge profile measurements {{were performed to}} reveal response of cutting edge geometry to the cutting parameters and wear. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to inspect the cutting edges.

A modified impeller mixing coupled with chill casting technique {{was used for}} the preparation of immiscible alloys. In this paper Al-Sn binary alloys was chosen for this study. This binary system shows the miscibility gap at different concentration and temperature. Graphite was chosen as reinforcing element which was reinforced in the Al-Sn matrix. The graphite content in the composite varied from 1. 6 to 8. 4 wt%. The presence of graphite in the matrix not only improves the mechanical properties but also improve the tribological properties due to lubricating action. The ductility of composite materials showed the adverse effect with increase of the graphite content in the matrix. Pin-on-disc sliding wear tests were conducted in an ambient condition to examine the tribological behavior of the aluminum-based graphite composite.

40|$|Statement of Problem: As a {{physical}} property, wear {{resistance of the}} materials used in the fabrication of orthodontic retainers {{play a significant role}} in the stability and long term use of the appliances. Objectives: To evaluate the wear resistance of two commonly used materials for orthodontic retainers: Acropars OP, i. e. a polymethyl methacrylate based material, and 3 A-GS 060, i. e. a polyethylene based material. Materials and Methods: For each material, 30 orthodontic retainers were made according to the manufacturers’ instructions and a 30 × 30 × 2 mm block was cut out from the mid- palatal area of each retainer. Each specimen underwent 1000 cycles of wear stimulation in a pin on disc machine. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> of each specimen was measured using a Nano Wizard II atomic force microscope in 3 random points of each specimen’s wear trough. The average of these three measurements was calculated and considered as mean value wear depth of each specimen (µm). Results: The mean wear depth was 6. 10 µm and 2. 15 µm for 3 A-GS 060 and Acropars OP groups respectively. Independent t-test showed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0. 001). The results show Polymethyl methacrylate base (Acropars) is more wear resistance than the polyethylene based material (3 A-GS 060). Conclusions: As the higher wear resistance of the fabrication material can improve the retainers’ survival time and its cost-effectiveness, VFRs should be avoided in situations that the appliance needs high wear resistance such as bite blocks opposing occlusal forces...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} part of maintenance costs in urban rail systems (metro, tram, light rapid transit/light metro) is due to wheel-rail wear. Wear rates - measured for example as <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> per kilometre run (rolling stock) or per train passage (rails) - depend in a complex manner on several influence factors. Among the most important are key design factors of the rolling stock (wheel profiles, suspension characteristics), of the track (distribution of curve radii, characteristics of switches and crossings, rail profiles), of the wheel-rail interface (lubrication, materials in contact, ambient characteristics), and of operations (frequency of traction and braking, trainset inversion policy, maintenance policy etc.). When designing an urban rail system, {{all of these factors}} have to be under control in order to limit the costs due to wheel/rail reprofiling/grinding and replacement. The state of the art allows the calculation of wear rates given quantitative input regarding the above factors. However, it is difficult to find in the literature experimental values for calibration of wear models and indications on what is a reasonable state-of-the-art wear rate for any given type of urban rail system. In this paper we present a structured analysis of flange wear rates found in the literature and derived from the experience of the authors, for a variety of cases, including metros and mainline rail systems. We compare the wear rates and explain their relationship with the influence factors. We then relate the wear rates with the needs in terms of wheel reprofiling/replacement. We estimate ranges for the calibration coefficients of wear models. We present the results in a way as to allow the designer of urban rail systems to derive values for target wear rates according to their specific conditions without the need for complex simulations...|$|E

The influence of microstructure, with respect to grain size and hardness, on machining is investigated in a transverse turning operation through the assessment <b>of</b> tool <b>wear,</b> wear mechanisms, surface deformation in the machined material, burr formation and characteristics of the chips. Concerning flank <b>wear,</b> machining <b>of</b> Waspaloy is associated with less <b>wear</b> than machining <b>of</b> Alloy 718. Fully age hardened Waspaloy showed even less flank wear than solution annealed Alloy 718 irrespective of grain size. This observation cannot be explained by cutting resistance, since Waspaloy shows higher cutting forces. Surface analysis shows a difference in tribological conditions on the flank face of the tool, which influences the magnitude <b>of</b> flank <b>wear.</b> The wear mechanisms when machining these alloys are concluded to be a combination of adhesive, abrasive, diffusion and dissolution mechanisms, but also associated with a beneficial effect of oxidation of tungsten, leading to potential formation of low-friction surface just beneath the flank wear zone. The grain size of the work material was found to affect the deformation behaviour in the metal cutting process. Inhomogeneous deformation occurs when the size of the grains is in the same order of magnitude as the undeformed chip thickness, in both solution annealed and fully precipitation hardened condition irrespective of the alloy composition. The inhomogeneous deformation was connected with large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cut notch <b>wear</b> and burr formation, together with formation <b>of</b> segmented chips. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> cut notch <b>wear</b> is the tool life limiting factor when machining the work material with the large grain size. Finally, a method for analysing and identifying crucial variables in the material specification that affect the machinability of the work material is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} water on the <b>wear</b> {{resistance}} <b>of</b> 3 µm thick sputtered gold films on silicon substrate using contact AFM and a scanning nanoindenter was investigated. In performing wear tests on gold samples in the presence of water, a significant increase in <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> area was observed compared to the same tests performed in the ambient atmosphere (~ 55 % humidity). These results were obtained using Hysitron Triboindenter on areas of 10 x 10 µm 2 and an Atomic Force Microscope on areas of 1 x 1 µm 2. Nanowear tests were preformed using silicon nitride cantilevers on the AFM and diamond Berkovich or blunt conical tips on the Hysitron. Normal loads used were 2 µN and 10 µN, respectively. Tests performed in the ambient atmosphere resulted in a slightly reduced surface roughness, while a much higher wear rate was observed in the wear tests performed in water. Additionally, gold surface ripples formed under certain scanning conditions, in water for the Hysitron Triboindenter and in ambient atmosphere for the AFM. Nanoscale stick slip is being investigated as a possible explanation to the rippling phenomenon, and single scan line tests provide valuable information about the mechanisms and progression <b>of</b> the nanoscale <b>wear...</b>|$|R
40|$|Edentulous {{persons have}} been {{reported}} as 'oral invalids and very handicapped' in masticatory function. These patients are usually older people and can be successfully restored with implant-retained prostheses (IRP). However, {{a high rate of}} wear is apparent on the artificial teeth in IRP and opposing dentures necessitating prostheses to be remade partially or in total. Such maintenance has considerable clinical and laboratory cost implications, since it forms 1 '. an increasing part of dentists' workload. The study investigated the wear rates among Various artificial tooth materials when subject to forces that represented those experienced in the clinical situation. The effect of abrasive slurry on the rate of wear was also investigated, as were the changes in hardness when artificial teeth were stored in food simulating solvents. A series of experiments was carried out in order to investigate these parameters on four commercially available Vivodent (VIV), Postaris (Del), Orthosit (aRT), Candulor (paR), and two experimental denture tooth materials; Experimental 1 (EXP 1) and Experimental 2 (EXP 2). Perspex (PER) was used as a control material. Two-body wear test A multi station wear-testing machine was constructed and used to test standardised hemispherical specimens against flat ones and measure the amount of wear using a non-contacting laser profiler to determine the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> scar. Different material combinations were tested including materials worn against themselves and against hemispherical steatite abraders. Measurements were made following 2000 cycles and 10, 000 cycles. Wearrates were determined as mean cross sectional area of the scar (Ilm/ 1 000 cycles). The results of this work revealed some interesting observations. Not all the specimens showed the classical wear pattern by creating a wear track on the flat specimen when the hemispherical abrader was sliding against it. Instead, in some material combinations there was a positive build up of material along the track and therefore a simple quantitative measurement of wear was not possible on all the specimens. The materials with a positive build up demonstrated an adhesive type of wear rather than the abrC?sive wear, which were further analysed under SEM. A technique was developed to measure wear occurring on hemispherical abraders. These were also qualitatively analysed under tool makers microscope and SEM. Abrasive and adhesive wear processes were noticed depending on the material combination tested. Three-body wear test Three-body abrasive wear tests were carried out on flat specimens using a toothbrushing machine with abrasive slurry. A laser profiler was used to measure the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> scar. Measurements were made following 10, 000 cycles except in porcelain specimens where measurements could only be recorded after 100, 000 cycles. Wear rates were determined as mean depth mm/l 000 cycles. POR, EXPl and ORT demonstrated significantly (P< 0. 5) lower three-body wear rate when compared to the other materials. There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear rates between PER, VIV, DeL, and EXP 2. Similarly, there was no significant difference between POR, EXPl and ORT. Effect of solvent storage on hardness The materials were tested for Martens Hardness measurements (HM) aHer storage in peppermint oil. 75 % ethanol and heptane. Distilled water was used as a control storage medium. One specimen from each material group was stored in each solvent for 1 minute. 5 minutes. I hour. 24 hours. 1 week and 1 month respectively. One specimen from each group was also tested dry to establish the baseline HM value. One-way ANOVA using Tukey's test on polymer based materials showed that the hardness of ORT and EXP 1 was significantly higher than the PMMA, Del and EXP 2 (P<O. 05). Moreover. EXPl had a significantly higher hardness value than ORT (P<O. 05). Regression analysis showed that the polymer based materials showed a significant drop in hardness aHer storage in 75 % ethanol (p<O. 05). Specimens stored in water, heptane and peppermint oil showed minor fluctuations in hardness, which were not of statistical significance. Regression analysis performed on polymer-based materials between three-body wear resistance and hardness showed a statistically significant correlation (p<O. 05). Conclusions The two-bOdy wear characteristics of some polymer-based materials when worn against themselves demonstrated a complex pattern of wear and quantitative measurement of wear scar in these specimens was not possible due to the positive build-up of material. It may be more important to describe the type of wear rather than the amount of wear occurring in some of the materials. The information from the wear characteristics is clinically relevant and should inform the clinician in choosing a material combination with better clinical performance. The three-body wear resistance of EXP 1 and ORT is significantly greater than other polymer based materials. EXP 1 is significantly harder than other polymer based denture teeth and storage in ethanol leads to significant reduction in hardness in all materials except POR. EXPI and ORT have significantly better three-body wear resistance than other polymer-based materials tested. There is correlation between hardness and resistance to three-body wear in the selected polymer-based materials. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Fresh, load-dependent, transport, and {{durability}} properties of alkali-activated fly ash mortars were studied. The influences of activator concentration, solution-to-binder ratio, curing condition, activator type, and sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio on {{the properties of}} the studied alkali-activated mortars were examined. This study was divided in two phases. The first phase dealt with the use of sodium hydroxide as the sole activator. The second phase of the study was divided into two parts, both of which used a combination of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as the activator solution. Part I of phase II used elevated temperature curing conditions, whereas part II utilized moist curing at ambient temperature. Fresh properties included workability and setting times. Load-dependent properties included compressive and flexural strengths, as well as modulus of elasticity. The evaluated transport properties were absorption, density, void content, and rapid chloride migration. Durability properties consisted of resistance to abrasion, sulfuric acid, freezing and thawing, and external sulfate attack. For the phase I of this study, workability and initial and final setting times were found to increase and decrease with increased solution-to-binder ratio and activator concentration, respectively. The effects of different curing conditions were found to be dependent on the concentration of sodium hydroxide. All mechanical properties tested were found to decrease and increased with increased solution-to-binder ratio and activator concentration, respectively. Absorption and rapid chloride migration were found to increase and decrease with increased solution-to-binder ratio and activator concentration, respectively. Results for density, on the other hand, produced the contrary. For the phase II of this study, workability was found to decrease with increased sodium hydroxide concentration and sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio. Mechanical properties were found to increase with an increase in sodium hydroxide concentration, as well as increased sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio up to 7. 5 M NaOH. Mechanical properties decreased with increases in sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio when 10 and 12. 5 M NaOH were used. Transport properties, namely absorption, void content and rapid chloride migration, results were found to decrease with increased sodium hydroxide concentration as well as sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio up to 7. 5 M sodium hydroxide. The named transport properties were found to increase with increased sodium silicate-to-total solution ratio for the mortars activated by 10 and 12. 5 M NaOH. Mass losses induced by acid attack and freezing and thawing cycles experienced the same trends as transport properties, whereas the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> results produced the contrary. Strength losses due to acid and sulfate attacks were minimal throughout the entire immersion duration; with the mortars having lower sodium hydroxide concentrations experienced larger losses as compared to the mortars containing higher sodium hydroxide concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Date palm {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cultivated}} palms mostly found in the Middle Eastern regions of the world. The date palm fruits are not only nutritionally rich, but also have a good amount of fatty acids such as oleic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acids, which have excellent anti-wear and lubricating properties, making it a potentially good candidate to be used as an environmentally-friendly lubricant. This study is a preliminary effort to explore the lubricating properties of date palm fruit syrup by conducting ball-on-disc wear tests on mild steel samples. Different concentrations (50, 75, and 100 vol %) of the syrup in water were tested at a normal load of 50 N and a sliding linear speed of 0. 1 m/s. Scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry were used to characterize the wear tracks and estimate the wear rates. 100 vol % date syrup with a viscosity of 16. 95 mPa·s showed excellent results by reducing the coefficient of friction of steel-on-steel from 0. 6 (dry conditions) to a value of ~ 0. 1. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> track reduced from ~ 152 µm (dry conditions) to ~ 11 µm, signifying a considerable reduction in wear...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} use of Plasma Source Ion Implantation (PSII) as a surface modification technique for enhancing properties such as biocompatibility and <b>wear</b> resistance <b>of</b> NiTi shape memory alloy. Both near-surface hardness, {{as measured by the}} microindentation technique, and wear resistance as measured with a fretting wear tester, were observed to improve {{as a result of the}} ion implantation treatment. However, it is speculated that the mechanical deformation processes occurring during indentation and wear testing treatment are influenced by the material’s ability to undergo pseudoelastic transformation under an applied stress. The maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> scar for the surface modified samples was 38 % lower in the dry condition and 79 % lower in the lubricated condition when compared to the control samples. While localized heating does occur in the wear scar during wear testing, the temperature excursions remain well within the temperature window where pseudoelastic transformation of the austenite phase is possible. Cyclic mechanical testing of ion implanted NiTi wires by the authors in a related previous study showed that the shape memory characteristics are retained after the ion implantation treatment. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{research}} knowledge gap for the dry <b>wear</b> data <b>of</b> nitride treated Stainless Steel in high temperature and high vacuum environment. In order to fill this gap, plasma nitriding was done on austenitic Stainless Steel type AISI 316 LN (316 LN SS) and dry sliding wear tests have been conducted at 25 degrees C, 200 degrees C and 400 degrees C in high vacuum of 1. 6 x 10 (- 4) bar. The two different slider material (316 LN SS and Colmonoy) and two different sliding speeds (0. 0576 m/s and 0. 167 m/s) have been used. The tribological parameters such as friction coefficient, wear mechanism and volume of metal loss have been evaluated. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to study the surface morphology <b>of</b> the <b>worn</b> pins and rings. Electronic balancing machine was used to record the mass of metal loss during wear tests. The 2 D optical profilometer {{was used to measure}} the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wear</b> track. The Plasma Nitride treated 316 LN SS rings (PN rings) exhibit excellent wear resistance against 316 LN SS pin and Colmonoy pin at all temperatures.

40|$|Effect {{of laser}} {{quenching}} on <b>wear</b> and damage <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials WJ Wang, J Guo, QY Liu and MH Zhu In order {{to alleviate the}} <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials, the <b>wear</b> experiments <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching were carried out using rolling-sliding testing apparatus. The results indicate that laser quenching pro-duces a hard martensite layer with a certain <b>depth.</b> The improvement <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> resistance <b>of</b> materials resulting from laser quenching markedly decreases the <b>wear</b> volume <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers. The maximal decrease rate <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> volume <b>of</b> wheel and rail materials is about 92. 9 % and 89. 5 %, respectively. Furthermore, the <b>worn</b> surfaces <b>of</b> wheel/rail rollers present different surface morphology and damage mechanisms due to difference of hardness matching. When the surface hardness of wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching is high, the spalling damage and adhesion wear are dominating. When a single wheel or rail roller undergoes laser quenching, the damage mechanism of wheel and rail rollers are significantly different. According to the severe <b>wear</b> region <b>of</b> the heavy-haul wheel/rail, it is proposed that the rail side and wheel flange may undergo laser quenching treatment for alleviating <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> heavy-haul wheel/rail materials.
