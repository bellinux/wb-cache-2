40|$|Even {{though there}} is a growing body of work documenting trends towards a professionalization of gender in {{political}} organisations and institutions in which parties are indirectly involved (such as women’s movements, parliaments, equality bodies and policy machineries), we know very little about whether and how parties as extra-parliamentary organisations have become more professionalized in their efforts to integrate a gender dimension in their workings. This paper therefore asks ‘to what extent and how a professionalization of gender has taken/is taking place in the Belgian parties’. This question is largely explorative and includes three sub-questions: (1) Who are the key <b>gender</b> <b>experts</b> and professionals in the Belgian parties, (2) What are the main tasks or daily assignments of these gender experts/professionals?, and (3) What is the (institutional) position of <b>gender</b> <b>experts</b> in the party? In order to answer these questions, the paper explores the ‘gendered’ aspects of party professionalization in 11 Belgian parties and map the different actors and tasks involved based on new and original data gathered by the authors in 2006 and 2014. The results show that a professionalization of gender is overall limited. Although parties have included <b>gender</b> <b>experts</b> in their organization (for instance in study centres or through the establishment of intra-party women’s groups), this gender expertise is often not structurally embedded, and thus not professionalized...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades several {{organizations}} at the During {{the past two}} decades several organizations at the transnational, national, and local levels, have committed to promoting women's rights and gender equality through various strategies, such as gender mainstreaming. Despite an increase in the prevalence of gender experts in the policy process, the impact of gender expertise on public policy is not fully understood. Feminist research has found that gender experts can be important to feminist policy success; however, we have little knowledge regarding how gender expertise is important and the factors which lead to successful adoption of gender expertise in public policy. Feminist and non-feminist research posits several factors that could potentially impact <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> policy success. However, what constitutes gender expertise in public policy remains largely unclear. In this dissertation I examine the factors that lead to <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> recommendations being incorporated into formally adopted policy through a sequential mixed-methods design utilizing interviews, survey analysis, and Crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to sort through these factors and identify whether any factors are necessary or sufficient to policy success. I develop a conceptualization of gender expertise and operationalize the concept by looking at individual credentials, training, or prior experience. I heed the call for greater comparison in gender research by utilizing gender experts across the globe to develop insights into the shared factors that bolster <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> success in public policy; these factors are further tested with Qualitative Comparative Analysis of policy debates in Western postindustrial democracies. I find that high-level political support is a sufficient condition for <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> policy success; however, it is also evident {{that it is not the}} only path to success for gender experts. In the absence of high-level political support gender experts can still achieve policy success if a women's policy agency advocates their recommendations and the issue is high on the women's movement agenda. I argue that future research examining gender expertise needs to be more broadly comparative and examine whether and how the relative importance of these factors change depending on the countries, policy sectors, or regions being examined.

The focus of the article is the draft guidelines that were adopted {{at the end of the}} meeting, and the process and deliberations that yielded that draft. The Pretoria Draft Guidelines clears up the uncertainty regarding how a report under the Protocol should be grafted into a report under the African Charter in terms of article 26 of the Women’s Protocol. As a set of guidelines, it seeks to achieve clarity and precision in three ways: by requiring states to report in terms of a list of measures of implementation; by drawing a clear distinction in the nature of information required in respect of first and subsequent reports; and by grouping the provisions of the Protocol into thematic clusters for reporting purposes. In the final analysis, it is concluded that the Pretoria Draft Guidelines provide a promising platform for the invigoration of the African Commission’s state reporting mechanism and, by extension, the promotion and protection of women’s rights in Africa. However, it has been noted that the effectiveness and impact of the reporting guidelines (and that of the reporting system as a whole) will depend on at least three other factors: the effective dissemination of the guidelines; the harmonisation of reporting guidelines; and the general reform of the African Commission’s reporting mechanism...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Accurate {{estimates}} of prevalence/incidence {{are important in}} understanding the true burden {{of male and female}} sexual dysfunction and in identifying risk factors for prevention efforts. This is the summary of the report by the International Consultation Committee for Sexual Medicine on Definitions/Epidemiology/Risk Factors for Sexual Dysfunction. AIM: The main aim {{of this article is to}} provide a general overview of the definitions of sexual dysfunction for men and women, the incidence and prevalence rates, and a description of the risk factors identified in large population-based studies. METHODS: Literature regarding definitions, descriptive and analytical epidemiology of sexual dysfunction in men and women were selected using evidence-based criteria. For descriptive epidemiological studies, a Prins score of 10 or higher was utilized to identify population-based studies with adequately stringent criteria. This report represents the opinions of eight experts from five countries developed in a consensus process and encompassing a detailed literature review over a 2 -year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study aims to provide state-of-the-art prevalence and incidence rates reported for each dysfunction and stratified by age and <b>gender.</b> <b>Expert</b> opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. RESULTS: A wealth of information is presented on erectile dysfunction, its development through time, and its correlates.

40|$|Queen Kristina of Sweden (1626 - 1689) was in {{many ways}} an interesting, {{fascinating}} but also a very complicated woman, who has been studied widely by historians and other scholars throughout the years. However, there are few people who have considered the queens attitude towards the male norm which characterize Sweden, and most of Europe, during the seventeenth century. My purpose with this essay is therefore to apply the historian and <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> Yvonne Hirdman´s theory about the gender system and the hierarchical order, where the male is the norm and representative of what is considered to be normal in the society, on literature regarding Queen Kristina of Sweden. The historical method of this essay will be historiography, {{as a result of the}} fact that my study is based on other historians and scholars research. Moreover, my intention is to include Kristina´s entire life in Sweden, from her birth as far as to her abdication from the Swedish throne and study this through the gender perspective introduced above. With this mentioned my essay therefore is named Against All Odds. A Study on Kristina of Sweden from a Gender Perspective.   The fact that Kristina of Sweden has been widely described by researchers with different disciplines and in various ways during the years becomes clear throughout this essay. In my essay concerning the male norm and queen Kristina it appears that elements like her male upbringing was of vital importance in her reply to the male norm and also towards her act against other females. The historian Peter Englund has mentioned the fact that Kristina carried out some form of mind change of her sex, maybe to be able to uphold the position as queen of Sweden. Moreover, Kristina broke the male norm by becoming queen but otherwise she accepted and, to some extent, even encouraged this dominant norm. ...|$|E
40|$|Describes {{experiences}} of: CIAT, Oxfam with Workshops, NetworksContext: Vulnerability {{of farmers}} equals vulnerability of supply chain. Inclusive management involves those {{that contribute to}} growing, selling and changing strategies. Crop modelling under different climate conditions requires knowledge of who’s growing, selling and involved in the supply chain. It also requires an analysis of who the beneficiaries of the value chain are and who will be adversely affected by changes in climate and in practice {{in order to identify}} appropriate adaptation strategies. Gender analysis is critical. Interface: Researchers and stakeholders such as farmers, extensionists, local governments, and ministers are brought together in workshops to discuss history, crop types and harvesting methods and climate change perceptions. Strategies such as visual questionnaires, maps, and models of 20 -year crop/climate projections are used to engage and discuss how resources change over time. Learning: Knowledge and networks from collaborative teams are leveraged in order to mobilize practical tools, systems and practices that build adaptive capacity among the poor and among women. Young people understand much faster about climate change. Youth and women are more engaged in participatory workshops. Interactive approaches feed information back into more relevant crop/climate models. Channel: Working with intermediaries such as Oxfam has contributed to ways of integrating gender-sensitive methods into the research process. The collaboration has provided Oxfam with CIAT’s relevant crop/climate expertise and information, and providing an avenue for research to be disseminated more broadly. Engaging with global food companies has typically included Corporate Social Responsibility departments. There is a recognized need that corporate buyers need to be brought into the collaborations in order to mainstream sustainable supply chains more broadly. A <b>gender</b> <b>expert</b> within CIAT is facilitating learning about the need for differentiated gender components in research. Agronomists are paying attention and using this resource now that the need has been identified within the institution. Outcome: Learning that women {{play a significant role in}} the supply chain but do not get shares of revenue leads to new research questions about what varieties and practices contribute to more visible and greater involvement. Oxfam included post-harvest facilities in the supply chain, formalizing women’s involvement in the supply chain and ability to generate income. Funding is viewed as a primary barrier to longer term learning cycles and for building continuous partnerships and trust over time. CIAT is working collaboratively with supply chain stakeholders and making links with large development NGOs, to use one part (approx. 8 %) of their funding for relevant scientific research that applies to local development projects. Where possible, it is expected that sampling design and the innovative methodologies developed can then be rolled out across extensive NGO networks, including Oxfam and Catholic Relief Services...|$|E

40|$|In a webinar in 2015 {{on health}} {{financing}} and gender, {{the question was}} raised {{why we need to}} focus on gender, given that a well-functioning system moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) will automatically be equitable and gender balanced. This article provides a reflection on this question from a panel of health financing and <b>gender</b> <b>experts.</b> We trace the evidence of how health-financing reforms have impacted gender and health access through a general literature review and a more detailed case-study of India. We find that unless explicit attention is paid to gender and its intersectionality with other social stratifications, through explicit protection and careful linking of benefits to needs of target populations (e. g. poor women, unemployed men, femaleheaded households), movement towards UHC can fail to achieve gender balance or improve equity, and may even exacerbate gender inequity. Political trade-offs are made on the road to UHC and the needs of less powerful groups, which can include women and children, are not necessarily given priority. We identify the need for closer collaboration between health economists and <b>gender</b> <b>experts,</b> and highlight a number of research gaps in this field which should be addressed. While some aspects of cost sharing and some analysis of expenditure on maternal and child health have been analysed from a gender perspective, there is a much richer set of research questions to be explored to guide policy making. Given the political nature of UHC decisions, political economy as well as technical research should be prioritized. We conclude that countries should adopt an equitable approach towards achieving UHC and, therefore, prioritize high-need groups and those requiring additional financial protection, in particular women and children.
