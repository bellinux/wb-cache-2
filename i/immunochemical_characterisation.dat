40|$|Plasma {{samples from}} {{patients}} with alcoholic cirrhosis were analysed for plasminogen activators and for inhibitors of the fibrinolytic system. Plasminogen activator activity was considerably increased in patients' plasma compared with normal. <b>Immunochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> of these plasminogen activators showed that they included both tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activator. The major inhibitor of plasmin, alpha 2 -antiplasmin, was decreased in the patients, but {{no evidence for}} the generation of plasmin was found...|$|E
40|$|Expression of hCG and its free {{subunits}} by non-trophoblastic tumours is well recognised. Previously {{we reported}} hCG secretion by normal and malignant bladder epithelial cells in vitro. Here we examined culture medium from 83 different cell lines derived mainly from common epithelial tumours. Thirty-two {{of the cell}} lines were found to secrete hCG-like material into their culture media. Partial <b>immunochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> showed that of these only choriocarcinoma and fetal tissue cell lines produced intact hCG and alpha subunit. The remaining 28 hCG-expressing epithelial cell lines, which are of mucosal origin, only secreted free beta subunit. Expression of free beta hCG by non-trophoblastic nonendocrine cells {{would appear to be}} especially characteristic of mucosal epithelia from the genitourinary and oral/respiratory tracts. Furthermore, this phenomenon may be characteristic of epithelium with transitional and/or squamous cell-like properties...|$|E
40|$|A new {{monoclonal}} antibody {{has been developed}} which is capable of detecting structures in gastric mucus glycoproteins expressed in the fetus and in adult gastric mucosa in conditions such as gastric carcinoma. Cancer associated monoclonal antibodies were selected by testing them against various mucous glycoprotein samples from the alimentary tract, including salivary glycoproteins from both secretory and non-secretory subjects, and cancerous and normal gastric juice glycoproteins. They were tested against 1000 samples of gastric juice from an unselected population. <b>Immunochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> suggested that the glycoproteins picked up by P 4 and i 11 include one of the compounds reacting with rabbit anti-fetal sulphoglycoprotein antigen serum. On {{the basis of a}} clinical trial and immunohistological evaluation further evidence was obtained of P 4 as the most promising antibody for further experimentation. A total of 302 gastric juice specimens from patients with various gastric symptoms were analysed using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique and P 4 antibody. Of 10 gastric cancers, nine had P 4 in the gastric juice. A positive correlation was found between gastric ulcer and the appearance of P 4. Duodenal ulcers were not correlated to P 4. Atrophic gastritis and P 4 coincided less frequently. Raised P 4 values were found in between 3 % and 9 % of subjects, depending on the population. Cancer cases showed high P 4 values, which allows adjustment of the lower limit of a positive result to high level whereby a considerable number of non-cancerous P 4 positives are omitted...|$|E
40|$|This review {{describes}} the different microtechniques {{developed for the}} extraction and purification of amyloid proteins from small specimens of fresh and formalin fixed tissues. These procedures differ with respect to solvent type, extraction conditions, and protein purification strategy. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the different microtechniques are discussed by taking into consideration tissue type (fresh of fixed) and size, amyloid type, and its content in the tissue. The review demonstrates the applicability of these techniques for the <b>immunochemical</b> and chemical <b>characterisation</b> of amyloid in different clinical forms of amyloidosis and in experimental small animal models. The clinical value of the applied microtechniques and their importance {{in the study of the}} pathogenesis of amyloid related diseases are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} cryoglobulinemic syndromes carried {{out over the}} years by our {{research}} group has been wide-ranging and includes: 1 <b>immunochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the cryoimmunoglobulin, 2) histological and immunoistochemical study of bone marrow, 3) role of HCV, 4) HCv, cryoglobuinaemia and monoclonal gammopathies, 5) HCV, mixed cryoglobulinemia and lymphoprolifaration, 6) natural history and epidemiology of type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia, 7) followup of patients with cryoglobulinemic syndrome. Our most important achievements have been in the demostration of the monoclonal nature of symptomatic tipeII mixed cryoglobulinemia (igMk-IgG) associated with medullary aspects of nodular clonal B expansion. The subsequent report (at the beginning of the 90 s) of anti-HCV antibodies in the course of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) was confirmed by us on a target population of 180 patients enlisted with the help of various medical and specialist department of Modena Policlinic and of hospitals in the Modena area. Accordingly we postulated a possible aetiopathogenetic role of the virus with respect to the aspects of clonal expansion. At the same time our case studies of patients qith monoclonal gammopathies, without cryoglobulinemic activity failed to reveal any connenction with HCV infection. Our findings qhich were followed up {{over a period of time}} by clinical, laboratory and instrumental checks, enabled us to show that nodular clonal B expansion, present in 75 % of the HCV -correlated MCII cases, remains unchanged over time and that clinical manifestations of lymphoma do not appear; death in these cases is due mainly to vasculitis and/or infectious process. In conclusion, therefore HCV-correlated MCII must be seen as an autoimmune systemic disease of infectious origin in which bone-marrow complications are an expression of chronic viral stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Brucella are facultative {{intracellular}} pathogens which infect and produce disease {{in a wide variety}} of mammals. Although some factors have been implicated in the virulence of Brucella, the virulence mechanisms of this intracellular pathogen are not known. Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is both chemically and biologically different as compared to common enteropathogens. The peptidoglycan of Brucella is strongly associated with the outer membrane (OM). The OM proteins of Brucella are strongly associated to the LPS molecule. Brucella LPS is not stabilised by divalent cations, and it contains less amount of Kdo and phosphate. This makes the molecule less negatively charged, and less susceptible to the action of cationic bactericidal peptides. Other lipids that may contribute to the resistance of microbicidal substances are the ornithine-containing lipids, the presence of phosphatidylcholine in the OM of Brucella, the long chain fatty acids in the lipid A, and the native hapten (NH) polysaccharide, located in the outer leaflet of the OM. <b>Immunochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the B. abortus LPS using monoclonal antibodies revealed nine epitopes in the LPS of B. abortus which were located: two in the O-chain; two in the core, three in the lipid A, two in the lipid associated OMP. Using these antibodies we could show that in addition to the heterogeneity in the O-polysaccharide of Brucella, the LPS {{of the genus}} is also heterogeneous in the core and lipid A. In contrast to other Gam-negative pathogens, Brucella do not show traditional aggressive virulence mechanisms such as exotoxins, anti-phagocytic capsules, fimbria, flagella or antigenic variation, even though it is highly pathogenic for preferred and accidental host. This virulence is must likely related to the cell envelope. Using well characterised preparations of Brucella LPS and lipid A, we have demonstrated a low activation of oxidative metabolism and Iysozyme release of human neutrophils, as compared to Salmonella LPS and lipid A preparations. These might be the factors contributing to survival and eventual reproduction of Brucella organisms within phagocytic cells. Brucella cells are resistant to polycationic peptides like defensins and polymyxin B, which destabilise the OM and usually have a lethal effect on enterobacterial strains. We have constructed a live model using rough (R) -Brucella-heterologous LPS chimeras as a tool to study the role of the LPS in the protection to cationic peptides and EDTA. This model showed that the resistance of R-Brucella/heterologous LPS chimeras was dependent on the origin of the LPS partitioned in the R-Brucella OM. The permeability of hydrophobic compounds into the OM of the hybrid cells showed similar pattern. Comparing the bactericidal effect and morphological alterations caused by cationic peptides on the natural rough B. ovis and mutant rough B. abortus with smooth B. abortus showed that rough Brucella variants have lower resistance compared to the smooth counterpart. This result supports the hypothesis that the presence of O polysaccharide and NH on the bacterial surface are factors that contribute to the increased OM resistance to the bactericidal action of cationic peptides. On the basis of these and accumulated experiences, it is proposed that the Brucella OM LPS layer is an efficient barrier for withstanding the digestive activities of phagocytes, and therefore this molecule should be considered as a virulence factor...|$|E
