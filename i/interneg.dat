40|$|As {{part of the}} <b>InterNeg</b> project, Inspire, {{which is}} an e-negotiation system to conduct {{bilateral}} negotiations, has been developed and deployed. INSS (<b>InterNeg</b> Support System) is an e-negotiation system that allows to use different negotiation strategies and tactics, and to negotiate over open and dynamically modifiable problems. It is based on Inspire but enhanced and expanded with some new features for more practical negotiations. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the design and implementation of INSS and its key features, including: (1) the construction of a negotiation protocol which allows negotiators to formulate their own negotiation case online, to specify the process and the permissible activities of its participants; (2) the introduction of the problem specification and modification components to construct INSS in the Invite platform; (3) the specification of different types of issues and options which can be introduced by the users and interpolated (or extrapolated) by the system; and (4) the establishment of a negotiation case library. To implement the system, we apply Fusebox technology prototyping and rapid application development (RAD). The INSS negotiation protocol and all its components are implemented in Invite system with database-driven approach. The system's usability will be tested {{with a small group of}} participants in different contexts defined by problem complexity and users' characteristics. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Software {{agent and}} {{decision}} support are rapidly developing information technologies {{due to their}} potential in supporting and conducting electronic transactions and other business activities. Negotiation via the Web is currently supported by several technologies, such as negotiation support systems, group decision support systems and negotiation software agents. Typically, {{and despite the fact}} that these technologies address different issues and can complement each other, they are used separately. A large experiment conducted in the <b>InterNeg</b> project led us to suggest a Web-based integrated software environment to aid negotiators and undertake certain activities autonomously. The architecture of the software environment, its components and their functions are discussed in the paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>InterNeg</b> Research Papers INR 07 / 04 Texts {{exchanged}} in business-related Computer-Mediated Communication, or CMC, {{differ from}} texts exchanged in other business situations. CMC data {{have a high}} concentration of non-standard textual features. The fast-growing amount of business CMC data offers opportunities for the application of statistical Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods, especially for text-classification purposes. We suggest a domain-specific text representation that helps avoid the negative effect of the non-standard text features. We report a variety of classification results that use this representation. We also build a statistical language model for the data and present its results. This is the first study on both statistical modeling of such data and their classification solely through text representation. ...|$|E
40|$|New {{information}} technologies invariably provide excellent opportunities {{for improving the}} efficiency and effectiveness of decision making and negotiation {{through the development of}} novel decision support techniques. Emerging Internet related technologies and, in particular, the World Wide Web provide yet another opportunity for radical change and improvement in the support and practice of negotiations. This view is supported by the results of a cross-cultural experiment that we have been conducting over the past year as part of the <b>InterNeg</b> project, observing computerassisted international negotiations over the Web. One of the surprises from this experiment is the degree of acceptance that the Web/computer technology achieved among a user base comprising both experienced negotiators and students. In this paper we report our experimental results and suggest the reasons behind and requirements for successful acceptance of Web based negotiation support technology, with the aim of stimulat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|INSPIRE is a Web-based {{system for}} the support and conduct of negotiation. The primary uses of the system are {{training}} and research. Between July 1996 and April 1997, 281 bilateral negotiations were conducted through the system by managers, engineers and students from over 50 countries. INSPIRE has been used at eight universities and training centers. In research it {{is being used to}} study cross-cultural differences in decision making and the use of computer support in negotiation. This paper outlines the system, the negotiation methodology embedded in it, and reports the initial results of the experimental study of the impact of culture on Web-based bilateral negotiation. Keywords: negotiation, international negotiation, cross-cultural study, Internet, World Wide Web, decision support, negotiation support, preferences.

40|$|Access to, and {{the ability}} to use {{computer}} and communication technologies varies widely between countries. It is often lack of proficiency rather than access that creates the barriers between developed and developing countries. The <b>interNeg</b> Web site and its online system INSPIRE and INSS, aim at overcoming these barriers by educating people around the world about decision and negotiation analysis and providing them with an opportunity to use decision support techniques. The systems allow one to conduct simulated negotiations with people from different cultures and solve realistic managerial decision problems. In this paper we present and discuss the limitations of the prevailing methods for teaching decision making and negotiation and present a technological solution that is Internet-based. We present our experiences with using our Web-based decision and negotiation support systems in executive training programs at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB). The discussion of extension to the presented methods and their use in higher education in developing countries concludes the paper. ...|$|E
40|$|Negotiation on the Internet {{is a new}} {{business}} activity that emerged {{with the development of}} the Internet and the World Wide Web. In order to study the use of software tools in cross-cultural Internet negotiations, a project named <b>InterNeg</b> was initiated. The INSPIRE negotiation support system of this project collected data of Internet negotiations by allowing participants to negotiate a mock case. Empirical research was conducted on these data by applying different data mining methods. This is because there were few former studies and hypotheses, and the variable number is large and they are not obviously correlated. Three data mining methods were applied to find hidden behavior patterns of Internet negotiations: Tree Rule Induction (TRI), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Logistic Regression Analysis (IRA). The results showed that the numbers of offers sent, especially during the early and middle negotiation stages, are positively related to reaching agreements, while sending offers at last minute has low chance to get the compromise. Other factors, such as gender and interval time between offers, can also affect Internet negotiation results. Comparisons of results from different data mining, especially on their prediction accuracies, were also conducted. The results revealed that the TRI method enjoys the highest prediction accuracy while consuming least processing time. The ANN method has the lowest prediction accuracy. Our research results also indicated that the layer number and hidden unit number in the layers could not affect the ANN method's prediction accuracy...|$|E
40|$|<b>InterNeg</b> Research Papers INR 02 / 04 With {{the rapid}} growth of {{electronic}} commerce, there is growing demand and great potential for online negotiation services. However, like other dot. com companies, it is unclear whether e-negotiation services will success by providing real business value and making profit. In this paper we propose a high-level e-negotiation business model and use it to analyze key issues for the success of these services. Specifically, we focus on the value proposition of e-negotiation systems and examine it through surveying potential market segments. While previous literature asses the efficiency and effectiveness of various online negotiations support methods, this exploratory research examines the online negotiation service itself and its potential from business users â€™ perspective. Our survey demonstrates that there is a low awareness for e-negotiation services though organizations spend large amounts on negations each year. Moving some of the traditional face to face negotiations to the Internet sphere could reduce the associated costs. In accordance with our assumptions, the benefits of e-negotiations are clear to the surveyed managers and so are the challenges. Most mangers {{believe that there is a}} great market potential for online negotiations services and that they will use it in the future as services mature. Based on the survey, we identify critical factors to the success of online negotiation services and suggest some ways to remove the hurdles and create a critical mass of users...|$|E
