5|$|In the 1980s, the Conservancy began a {{gene bank}} {{designed}} {{to preserve the}} genetic material of rare breeds. After collecting genetic material from over a dozen rare breeds, the bank {{was transferred to the}} USDA National Animal <b>Germplasm</b> Program (NAGP). It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP, including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds. The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation, an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve <b>germplasm</b> from rare breeds. In the early 1990s, the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, designed to raise public awareness of the declining populations of rare livestock breeds.|$|E

5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve <b>germplasm</b> from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National <b>germplasm</b> storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
40|$|We genotyped 74 rice <b>germplasms</b> {{including}} Tripura's local landraces, improved varieties, cultivars {{and breeding}} lines and other rice varieties using molecular markers for genetic diversity, drought QTLs, and blast resistance genes. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 5 {{with an average}} of 2. 9. The polymorphic information content value per locus ranged from 0. 059 (RM 537) to 0. 755 (RM 252) {{with an average of}} 0. 475. Cluster analysis based on 30 simple sequence repeat markers revealed 5 clusters and also indicated the presence of variability within the rice accessions. The drought QTL qDTY 2. 1 was found in 56. 0 % of <b>germplasms</b> and qDTY 1. 1 was detected in only 6. 8 % of the <b>germplasms.</b> Out of seven rice blast resistance genes screened, only two rice varieties, RCPL- 1 - 82 and Buh Vubuk (Lubuk), were positive for four blast resistance genes while only Releng possessed two blast resistance genes. Among 74 rice <b>germplasms,</b> only three accessions, Releng, RCPL 1 - 82 and Buh Vubuk (Lubuk), possessed both drought-related QTLs and blast resistance genes. Overall, the 74 indigenous rice genotypes showed low level of genetic diversity, which is in contrast to high level of genetic diversity among rice varieties in northeast India, where highlights the good farming practice, conservation of <b>germplasms</b> and the limitation of molecular markers employed in this study. The presence of both drought related QTLs and blast resistance genes in some of the <b>germplasms</b> can be useful in future breeding programmes...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-eight rice <b>germplasms</b> {{were used}} for cold {{tolerance}} evaluation at the germination stage in laboratory. Seeds of rice <b>germplasms</b> germinated at three different temperatures containing low temperature (constant 13 °C for 28 days), alternative temperature (a temperature cycle of 12 h at 20 °C and 12 h at 23 °C for 14 days) and control (constant 26 °C for 7 days). Analysis of variance revealed that temperature {{had a significant effect}} on germination rate, coleoptile length and radicle length. Germination rate was strongly affected by the low temperature and alternative treatments. Stress of low temperature at the germination stage on the tested rice <b>germplasms</b> caused a reduction in final germination rate and the lengths of coleoptile and radicle. The normal and healthy seeds began to germinate within 36 h after imbibition and germination were completed on the 7 th day in the control, but delayed under the low and alternative temperature treatments. The low and alternative temperature treatments delayed the growth of coleoptile and radicle compared to the control, and the average lengths of coleoptile and radicule were strongly inhibited with the decreasing temperature in all of the tested <b>germplasms.</b> Taichung, a semi-dwarf, low amylose content and early maturing rice variety, showed a significantly higher germination rate at the three temperature treatments and its coleoptile length was significantly higher than other <b>germplasms...</b>|$|R
40|$|A few {{breeding}} companies {{dominate the}} maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid market in Brazil: Monsanto® (35 %), DuPont Pioneer® (30 %), Dow Agrosciences® (15 %), Syngenta® (10 %) and Helix Sementes (4 %). Therefore, {{it is important}} to monitor the genetic diversity in commercial <b>germplasms</b> as breeding practices, registration and marketing of new cultivars can lead to a significant reduction of the genetic diversity. Reduced genetic variation may lead to crop vulnerabilities, food insecurity and limited genetic gains following selection. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the genetic vulnerability risk by examining the relationship between the commercial Brazilian maize <b>germplasms</b> and the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) Parents. For this purpose, we used the commercial hybrids with the largest market share in Brazil and the NAM parents. The hybrids were genotyped for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using the Illumina Goldengate® platform. The NAM parent genomic data, comprising 1, 536 SNPs for each line, were obtained from the Panzea data bank. The population structure, genetic diversity and the correlation between allele frequencies were analyzed. Based on the estimated effective population size and genetic variability, it was found that there is a low risk of genetic vulnerability in the commercial Brazilian maize <b>germplasms.</b> However, the genetic diversity is lower than those found in the NAM parents. Furthermore, the Brazilian <b>germplasms</b> presented no close relations with most NAM parents, except B 73. This indicates that B 73, or its heterotic group (Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic), contributed to the development of the commercial Brazilian <b>germplasms...</b>|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the San Clemente to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal <b>Germplasm</b> Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and <b>germplasm</b> (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E
25|$|Animal housing {{practical}} when collecting germplasms {{because they}} keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making {{the process of}} collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting <b>germplasm</b> may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal {{to become familiar with}} the process is key. Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to <b>germplasm,</b> <b>germplasm</b> to <b>germplasm,</b> and <b>germplasm</b> to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.|$|E

25|$|The second {{technique}} for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals.

30|$|Between 1978 and 1985, nearly 40, 000 <b>germplasms</b> (accessions and {{breeding}} lines) were screened {{for the best}} drought tolerant germplasm; however, {{the majority of the}} top 20 outstanding <b>germplasms</b> were breeding lines (de Datta et al. 1988). The sources of tolerance in breeding lines are often obscure as the breeding process involves numerous parents. For instance, the ancestry of the most popular rice variety, IR 64 includes 19 landraces from nine different countries (Khush and Virk 2005). All these large-scale drought and related screening results clearly showed that drought tolerance largely depends on growth stage, severity of drought and the specific environmental conditions. Most importantly, drought tolerance for vegetative stages does not correlate with yield performance under water stress.

40|$|Assigning <b>germplasms</b> into {{different}} heterotic groups is fundamental for exploitation of heterosis for hybrid development. An experiment {{was conducted in}} order to establish heterotic groups of some maize populations. Line x tester design was used for making crosses. Ten open pollinated varieties were used as lines and four as testers. Forty crosses along with their parents were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Three testers were open pollinated varieties and one tester was a NML- 2, an inbred line developed by CIMMYT. Basis of grouping the <b>germplasms</b> {{into different}} heterotic groups was specific combining ability (SCA) effects for grain yield. Population 46 C, Rampur So 3 Eo 2, and Rampur So 3 Fo 2 showed positive SCA effects with NML- 2, and negative with 1 Arun- 4. These <b>germplasms</b> were assigned into heterotic group A.
