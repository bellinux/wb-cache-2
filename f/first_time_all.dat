5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>all</b> four Canadian {{divisions}} were {{assembled to}} participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} game of the regular season, Michigan lost by a 30-point margin (37–7) against Ohio State in The Game. Robinson failed to {{register}} a passing or rushing touchdown for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>all</b> season. Although he rushed for 105 yards on 18 carries, he was limited to 87 passing yards. After sustaining two dislocated fingers on his non-throwing hand, Robinson was replaced in the second half by Tate Forcier.|$|E
5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>all</b> game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard {{drive that}} resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added twofield goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of reach for Virginia Tech. Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The 1st {{round of}} the tournament, seven of the eight seeded teams {{advanced}}.

For the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>all</b> four Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) teams advanced to the second round. It was just the second time in tournament history that four teams from the same conference advanced. The first instance occurred in 1990 with Brown, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale of the Ivy League.|$|E

Additionally, for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>all</b> uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches and umpires) wore #42 for the day. The sole exception was when the scheduled game at Nationals Park between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Nationals was rained out; they wore the jerseys in the night game of a day-night doubleheader May 16.|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} {{event of the}} 2016/17 season in Ruka, Finland, Prevc, who was leading after the first series, fell upon landing in the second series and {{finished}} third. His brother Domen scored his first World Cup victory at that occasion. Throughout December, Prevc was struggling with his jumps, fell again upon landing at the first event in Engelberg and did not reach the final round at the second event. After the Four Hill Tournament, where he finished 14th, Prevc skipped the events in Wisla. Following the break, his results started to improve again. Prevc was the best individual of the team event in Zakopane, where Slovenian team finished third. The team event in Willingen saw, for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>all</b> three Prevc brothers representing Slovenia, together with Tepeš; they finished fourth. On 11 February, he won in Sapporo for the fourth year in a row. It was a double win with Maciej Kot.|$|E
5|$|The two teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} their receivers' success in eluding the {{opposing}} defenses. Florida State quarterback Chris Rix completed 12 of his 25 pass attempts for two touchdowns, 269 yards, and one interception. Rix also ran the ball 12 {{times during the}} game. Although he lost a total of 19 yards, one of his positive rushes resulted in a rushing touchdown. Despite that score, the game marked the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>all</b> season that Rix had been held to negative rushing yardage. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Grant Noel completed 15 of 27 pass attempts for 269 yards and a touchdown. Backup quarterback Bryan Randall threw an interception on his only pass attempt of the game, and wide receiver Richard Johnson's trick pass attempt fell incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>all</b> season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E
