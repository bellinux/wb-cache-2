5|$|Like other newts, Triturus species {{develop in}} the water as larvae, and return to it <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> breeding. Adults spend one half to three {{quarters}} of the year on land, depending on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.|$|E
