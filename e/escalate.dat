Patients and methods: Economic evaluation of flexible-dose fesoterodine in newly diagnosed patients, including two treatment groups: standard <b>escalating</b> from 4 to 8 mg or fast <b>escalating</b> to 8 mg. Costs were estimated from health care resources utilization related to OAB, and were expressed in 2015 Euros. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) {{were obtained from}} overactive bladder questionnaire-short form. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results: Three hundred and ninety symptomatic OAB patients treated with fesoterodine and newly diagnosed (141 in fast <b>escalating</b> group and 249 in standard <b>escalating)</b> were analyzed. Adjusted health care total costs were not statistically different; difference −€ 4. 1 (confidence interval: − 153. 3; 25. 1) P= 0. 842. QALYs were higher in fast <b>escalating</b> to high dose vs standard <b>escalating</b> group, resulting in a cost of −€ 16, 020 /QALY gained for fast <b>escalating</b> vs standard <b>escalating</b> group. Conclusion: When the cost-effectiveness threshold is set at a maximum value of € 30, 000 /QALY gained, fesoterodine fast <b>escalating</b> group was cost-effective vs standard <b>escalating</b> group 67. 6 % of the time. The treatment with fesoterodine, in female patients newly diagnosed, fast <b>escalating</b> to 8 mg was a cost-effective option relative to <b>escalating</b> traditionally from 4 to 8  mg, {{in the management of}} OAB in routine clinical practice, from the Spanish National Health System perspective.

Upon failure, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDT/ASCT) is performed, but its effectiveness has not been verified in this setting. We analyzed all Swiss cases of chemosensitive HL autografted after failure of BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> (n = 22) and compared outcomes with 22 cases of HDT/ASCT following frontline ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) failure. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 76 % for ABVD and 42 % for BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> (p = 0. 029). Two- and 5 -year overall survival (OS) was 90 % and 71 % for ABVD and 72 % and 65 % for BEACOPP <b>escalated,</b> respectively (p = not significant). Three patients in the ABVD and four in the BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> groups underwent allotransplant for relapse after HDT/ASCT. Grade 3 - 4 toxicities were comparable in both groups. Three cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) were recorded in the BEACOPP <b>escalated</b> group.

5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to <b>escalate,</b> while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to <b>escalate</b> when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E
