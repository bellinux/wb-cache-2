5|$|Civil strife {{and foreign}} invasions, {{such as the}} Mongol invasions in 1240/1241, 1259/1260 and 1287/1288, {{weakened}} and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor</b> caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly German settlers; the early waves from Germany and Flanders occurred in the 1220s. The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and German town laws were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important {{in the rise of}} the cities and the establishment of the Polish burgher (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws (Magdeburg rights) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by patriciates) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.|$|E

40|$|Summary: This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} technology and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor</b> both historically and empirically. First, it is {{pointed out that the}} Industrial Revolution substituted skilled labor with unskilled labor since it has a de-skilling characteristic. Second, the skill-bias feature of Information and Communication Technologies Revolution is suggested. Finally, the effect of technological progress on the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor</b> is tested <b>for</b> Turkish Private Manufacturing Industries. According to the static panel data estimation results, there is a positive but weak relationship between technological progress and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the dynamic of the relative <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor</b> in Brazilian industry, during the last decade. Thus, presenting evidences that relative <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skill increased overall in the period, it seeks to explain this movement, at least in part. For this, we test the hypothesis of skill biased technological changes {{in an environment of}} economic opening. The results indicate that a greater share of imported intermediate goods in factories, signaled by the reduction in the tariffs charged on these goods, explains the shift in relative <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor,</b> throughout an increasing in the relative productivity between skilled and unskilled workers. This points out {{to the fact that the}} hypothesis of skill biased technological changes explains, at least in part, the shift in the relative <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labor.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Construction of the Industrial Canal led to {{development}} of the land farther back along the Canal; it provided steady work for labor in the area.

25|$|Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) {{show that}} from 1800 to 1940 {{there was a}} {{demographic}} shift from a mostly rural US population with high fertility, {{with an average of}} seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor,</b> a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.|$|E
25|$|The initial mining centers {{were located}} near the Guatemalan border, around Gracias. In 1538 these mines {{produced}} significant quantities of gold. In the early 1540s, the center for mining shifted eastward to the RÃ­o Guayape Valley, and silver joined gold as a major product. This change contributed to the rapid decline of Gracias {{and the rise of}} Comayagua as the center of colonial Honduras. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor</b> also led to further revolts and accelerated the decimation of the native population. As a result, African slavery was introduced into Honduras, and by 1545 the province may have had as many as 2,000 slaves. Other gold deposits were found near San Pedro Sula and the port of Trujillo.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how trade liberalization affects the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> child <b>labor</b> employing a dynamic North-South trade framework. Innovating {{firms in the}} North {{are assumed to be}} heterogeneous and differ in their marginal costs while imitating firms in the South are homogeneous and may employ children in production to reduce their marginal cost. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> child <b>labor</b> is dependent not only on domestic factors such as wages of adults and children, but also on the endogenous rate of innovation in the North and the rate in which these goods are imitated in the South. Reductions in trade costs increase the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> new goods produced in the North and reduce the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> old goods produced in the South. An increase in the population of the North and/or South will increase the overall <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> child <b>labor</b> although the child labor participation rate will increase (decrease) when the population in the North (South) increases...|$|R

25|$|A {{force of}} 65 Heinkel He 111s participated from Sola and Kjevik in the raid on Britain, {{but it was}} so {{unsuccessful}} that Luftflotte 5 would no longer play a role in attacks on Britain. The Wehrmacht gave up on its original plan on 15 September, which also changed the anticipated role for Sola and Forus. The importance of Sola and Forus thus became the need to defend from British attacks, rather than offense. Forus became part of Festung Stavangerâa heavy construction of defensive structures in JÃ¦renâwhich {{played a key role in}} Festung Norwegen. This massive endeavor created a surge in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor,</b> while the wartime halt to commerce escalated unemployment. Construction was therefore typically carried out by Norwegians, partially voluntary, partially out of dire hunger and partially by force. After the war progressed, work was gradually taken more over by Russian prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|The {{weakness}} of central government prevented an {{introduction of a}} uniform statewide economic policy, even as feeble attempts to implement mercantilism and state protectionism (widely then practiced in Europe) were being made. The balance of trade remained negative most of the time, and the country's transit role diminished. The lack of central controls opened the Commonwealth to exploitation by more advanced economies. The monetary crisis and chaotic policy in that area, as well as Frederick II's flooding of Poland with fake Polish currency, resulted in massive devaluations and economic losses. With the townspeople increasingly employed in agriculture, where there was <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor,</b> the guild crafts and manufacturing, the mainstay of the urban middle class, became reduced to a fraction of its past capacity. However, the Commonwealth was able to preserve or rebuild much of the mining, metallurgy and heavier industries, {{some of which were}} important for military applications.|$|E
25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent {{increase}} in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1â3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labor</b> at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20â24.|$|E
