5000|$|The DTR {{signal is}} present on pin 20 of the 22-wire RS-232 {{interface}} using a <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector,</b> and on pin 4 of a newer DE-9 serial port. The signal is asserted (logic [...] "1") {{by raising the}} voltage of the pin from negative to positive. Dropping the signal back to its negative state indicates to the modem that the communications session shall be terminated.|$|E
50|$|The {{connection}} between the computer host adapter (DB-25F) and the hard drive unit consists of a cable with two <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} commonly used RS-232 signals (called [...] "circuits" [...] in the specifications) and their pin assignments on the recommended <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors.</b> (See Serial port pinouts) for other commonly used connectors not {{defined by the}} standard.) ...|$|R
50|$|A simple serial {{interface}} loopback test, called paperclip test, is sometimes {{used to identify}} serial ports of a computer and verify operation. It utilizes a terminal emulator application to send characters, with flow control set to off, to the serial port and receive the same back. For this purpose, a paperclip is used to short pin 2 to pin 3 (the receive and transmit pins) on a standard RS-232 interface using D-subminiature DE-9 or <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{signal ground}} {{is a common}} return for the other connections; it appears on two pins in the Yost {{standard}} but is the same signal. The <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector</b> includes a second [...] "protective ground" [...] on pin 1, which {{is intended to be}} connected by each device to its own frame ground or similar. Connecting this to pin 7 (signal reference ground) is a common practice but not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signals are}} named from the {{standpoint}} of the DTE. The ground pin is a common return for the other connections, and establishes the [...] "zero" [...] voltage to which voltages on the other pins are referenced. The <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector</b> includes a second [...] "protective ground" [...] on pin 1; this is connected internally to equipment frame ground, and should not be connected in the cable or connector to signal ground.|$|E
50|$|RS-422 {{specifies}} {{the electrical}} {{characteristics of a}} single balanced signal. The standard was written to be referenced by other standards that specify the complete DTE/DCE interface for applications which require a balanced voltage circuit to transmit data. These other standards would define protocols, connectors, pin assignments and functions. Standards such as EIA-530 (<b>DB-25</b> <b>connector)</b> and EIA-449 (DC-37 connector) use RS-422 electrical signals. Some RS-422 devices have 4 screw terminals for pairs of wire, with one pair used for data in each direction.|$|E
5000|$|Two RS-232/RS-423 serial ports: 8-pin mini-DIN <b>connectors</b> (<b>DB-25</b> adapter cables are provided) ...|$|R
5000|$|Lt. Kernal uses a 5¼" [...] Hard {{disk drive}} with a {{capacity}} of 10 MB and later up to 330 MB. The hard drive uses MFM modulation to encode data and a ST-506 interface to the OMTI 5300 intelligent SASI controller. This controller board presents a SASI interface (SCSI) externally that is connected via a cable with <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors</b> in both ends. That is plugged into the host adapter that handles the SASI signals and protocol with a controller that plugs directly into the 44-pin ROM cartridge expansion slot {{in the form of}} a physical edge connector that mates the controller board to the system bus of the host computer.|$|R
50|$|However, this naming {{pattern is}} not always followed. Because {{personal}} computers first used <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors</b> for their serial and parallel ports, when the PC serial port began to use 9-pin connectors, they were often labeled as DB-9 instead of DE-9 connectors, due to an ignorance {{of the fact that}} B represented a shell size. It is now common to see DE-9 connectors sold as DB-9 connectors. DB-9 nearly always refers to a 9-pin connector with an E size shell. The non-standard 23-pin D-sub connectors for external floppy drives and video output on most of the Amiga computers are usually labeled DB-23, even though their shell size is two pins smaller than ordinary DB sockets.|$|R
5000|$|Housing: 42 × 32 × 10 cm plastic cream {{weighing}} about 6.4 kg The front {{half of the}} top shows {{a depression}} to bring the monitor. In the front two 3.5" [...] floppy drives that can be protected with a shutter for transport. Under these, a carrying handle. At the rear two proprietary Apricot connector slots for expansion, parallel printer port of Centronics micro ribbon 36 pin connector type, serial port <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector,</b> monitor connector and power supply with a switch.|$|E
5000|$|The Roland MPU-IPC-T is a MIDI Interface from Roland Corporation {{aimed at}} IBM PC and compatibles. It is an 8-bit ISA {{standardized}} half-size card {{connected to a}} break-out box via a <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector.</b> This card {{seems to be a}} slightly modified version of the Roland MPU-IPC card. The MPU-IPC-T model, from various images and specification charts allows the user to select different Base I/O port address and IRQ settings, the other model does not it seems. The IRQ ranges are limited to 2 through 7 and the Base I/O port addresses from 325h to 338h.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, {{along with}} the {{introduction}} of the Apple IIe, Apple initially offered a combination of two, two third-height, 140ki Disk II drive mechanisms side-by-side in a single plastic case, called the DuoDisk 5.25 (A9M0108), which could not be daisy-chained. The unit was designed to be stacked on top of the computer, and beneath the monitor. Each unit required its own disk controller card (as each card could still control only two drives) and the number of units was thus limited to the number of available slots; in practice, few uses of the Apple II computer can make good use of more than two 5.25" [...] drives, so this limitation mattered little. Originally released with a <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector,</b> to match that of the Apple III Plus, it was the first to adopt Apple's standard DB-19 floppy drive connector.|$|E
50|$|The initial version {{featured}} an InPort ISA interface, {{requiring a}} Microsoft bus card {{to be installed}} in the computer. Later versions were available with DE-9 or <b>DB-25</b> serial <b>connectors.</b> All versions of the Microsoft Mouse could be used with IBM-compatible and other MS-DOS systems.|$|R
5000|$|Early SCSI {{interfaces}} {{commonly used}} a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. This connector {{is similar to}} the 36-pin connector used by Centronics for the parallel interface on their printers, thus the connector became popularly known as [...] "Centronics SCSI" [...] or [...] "CN-50". It is also referred to as a [...] "SCSI-1 connector"; since many connectors have been used for SCSI-1, this can be confusing.Apple used <b>DB-25</b> <b>connectors,</b> which, having only 25 pins rather than 50, were less expensive to make, but compromised functionality. Further, DB-25s were commonly used for RS-232 serial cables and also to connect parallel printers, meaning that users might accidentally try to use completely inappropriate cables, since the printer and serial cables would fit the connector properly and be hard to visually distinguish. The DB-25's only advantage was that it was smaller than a CN50.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sound was}} 8-bit stereo. I/O was {{available}} with dual serial ports, an AAUI ethernet port, mic in, and a <b>DB-25</b> SCSI <b>connector.</b> Expansion was available via two Nubus slots and a PDS slot. This {{is one of}} the two earliest models that are able to run Mac OS 8, along with the Macintosh Quadra 900.|$|R
50|$|The AppleCD SC was {{the first}} CD-ROM by Apple Computer Company, {{introduced}} in 1988. It originally contained a fan but in 1990 they removed {{it because it was}} unneeded and attracted dust onto the optical disk head which could cause problems. It uses a front-loading caddy 1x CD-ROM and is only capable of Read Only Media. This accessory device was only able to read compact disks up to a 650 MB capacity in five formats, CD-Audio, CD-ROM, HFS, ProDOS, and High Sierra. On the front of the device it has an eject button, mini-phono sound out jack, and a volume knob. On the rear it has a power switch, power input, two Centronics 50-pin SCSI outputs, and an audio RCA connector. With appropriate software it would run on any Macintosh with a <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector,</b> or an Apple II with an Apple II SCSI interface card.|$|E
50|$|While the RS-232 {{standard}} originally specified a 25-pin D-type connector, many {{designers of}} personal computers chose to implement only {{a subset of}} the full standard: they traded off compatibility with the standard against the use of less costly and more compact connectors (in particular the DE-9 version used by the original IBM PC-AT). The desire to supply serial interface cards with two ports required that IBM reduce the size of the connector to fit onto a single card back panel. A DE-9 connector also fits onto a card with a second <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector.</b> Starting {{around the time of the}} introduction of the IBM PC-AT, serial ports were commonly built with a 9-pin connector to save cost and space. However, presence of a 9-pin D-subminiature connector is not sufficient to indicate the connection is in fact a serial port, since this connector is also used for video, joysticks, and other purposes.|$|E
50|$|The first {{variation}} of the Disk II introduced for the Apple ///, called the Disk III (A3M0004), used the identical drive mechanism inside a modified plastic case with a proprietary connector. With some modification both drives are interchangeable. Though Apple sought to force the purchase of new drives with the Apple ///, many former Apple II users quickly devised a way to adapt their existing and cheaper Disk II drives, however only one external Disk II was supported in this manner. The Disk III {{was the first to}} allow daisy chaining of up to three additional drives to the single 26-pin ribbon cable connector on the Apple ///, for a total of 4 floppy disk drives - the Apple /// was the first Apple to contain a built-in drive mechanism. The Apple III Plus changed its 26-pin connector to a <b>DB-25</b> <b>connector,</b> which required an adapter for use with the Disk III.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} between a radio and a terminal is typically a standard serial port — a <b>DB-25</b> or DE-9 <b>connector</b> carrying asynchronous start-stop bytes with RS-232 signal levels.TNCs were {{originally designed to}} accept messages from a human typing on a dumb terminal.However, typically a human uses a more sophisticated software package running on a personal computer that sends messages to the TNC using the KISS (TNC) protocol or the 6PACK protocol.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{standard}} definitions {{are not always}} correctly applied, it is often necessary to consult documentation, test connections with a breakout box, or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices. Connecting a fully standard-compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector (a so-called [...] "straight cable"). [...] "Gender changers" [...] are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors. Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins {{according to the table}} above. Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common. Manufacturers of equipment with 8P8C connectors usually provide a cable with either a <b>DB-25</b> or DE-9 <b>connector</b> (or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices). Poor-quality cables can cause false signals by crosstalk between data and control lines (such as Ring Indicator).|$|R
