After an introduction to the underlying physical ideas, we discuss in detail the formalism of the heavy quark effective theory, including a comprehensive treatment of symmetry breaking corrections. We then illustrate some nonperturbative approaches, which aim at a dynamical, QCD-based calculation of the universal form factors of the effective theory. The main focus is on results obtained using QCD sum rules. Finally, we perform an essentially model-independent analysis of semileptonic $B$ meson decays {{in the context of the}} heavy quark effective theory.

Working at the so-called symmetrical point allows to perform minus-sign free QMC simulations and thus reach temperatures of less than 1 % of the conduction electron bandwidth. Study of the temperature dependence of the single particle Green's function and dynamical spin correlation function shows a surprisingly intricate low temperature band structure and gives evidence for two characteristic temperatures, which we identify with the Kondo and coherence temperature, respectively. In particular, the data show a temperature induced metal-insulator transition at the coherence temperature.
