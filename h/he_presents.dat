5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has {{an idea of what}} the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{looks more}} to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the concertato style with basso continuo (a device that {{was to become a}} typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.|$|E

5|$|The three {{arrive in}} Fairhope, Pennsylvania where Tommy and Jeffrey are living. The agents talk to Tommy and {{conclude}} {{that something is}} going on. They soon discover that their car will not start. Back at her apartment, Scully is visited by Gabe Rotter (Brian Poth), a potential suitor of Harrison's. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> Scully with the corpse of Spanky. Scully does an ad hoc necropsy and concludes that the cat bit its stomach open {{to try to get}} something out. She also discovers a cavity, where it appears something had lived inside the cat.|$|E
5|$|Tōbei steals {{the severed}} {{head of a}} general, which <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> to the {{commander}} of the victorious side. He is rewarded with armor, a mount, and a retinue. Tōbei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there as a prostitute. Tōbei promises to buy back her honor. Later, the two return to Nakanogō, Tōbei throwing his armor into a river along the way.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian {{sound and}} {{installation}} artist {{best known for}} his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), {{a gangster}} {{who is in}} love with the voice of Janhavi (Vidya Balan), a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest {{featuring}} the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House.' To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>presented</b> the trivia game Quiz Star, from 10 February 1986 to 6 September 1987 on Canal +, {{prior to}} succeed Philippe Gildas {{to present the}} show Direct. <b>He</b> <b>presented</b> La Nouvelle Affiche in 1987 on France 3.|$|R

5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill {{feel they}} are ready to present, but at the event, Blanchard places acid on the machine when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{absolute}} consensus about the adherence of the kings before Darius, such as Cyrus and Cambyses, it is well established that Darius was an adherent of Zoroastrianism {{or at least a}} firm believer in Ahura Mazda. As can be seen at the Behistun Inscription, Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire. Darius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. In many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements, <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, {{releasing}} Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E

5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. <b>He</b> <b>presents</b> a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't do it without rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not the real one but instead the one from the parallel universe. Olivia continues to play along, explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which <b>he</b> <b>presents</b> as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
