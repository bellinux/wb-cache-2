5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or <b>forest</b> <b>soils,</b> {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E

Five soil compositions (i) 80 % lake sand: 20 % <b>forest</b> <b>soil,</b> ii) 50 % lake sand: 50 % <b>forest</b> <b>soil,</b> iii) 80 % swamp soil: 20 % <b>forest</b> <b>soil,</b> iv) 50 % swamp soil: 50 % <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> and v) <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> alone), and five irrigation frequency levels (once a week, twice a week, three times a week, four times a week, and daily) were evaluated on six common bean varieties with varying levels of resistance to FRR. <b>Forest</b> <b>soil</b> and 50 % swamp soil: 50 % <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> (soil composition); daily irrigation and irrigation once a week (irrigation frequency) differentiated test varieties most distinctly, according to their reaction to FRR.

The present investigation, therefore, was carried out to evaluate the role of open cast coal mining in alteration of native soil characteristics. Soil samples are collected from disturbed soils of Ledo colliery and undisturbed <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> Soil characteristics of Ledo colliery deviated from <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> The pH of the disturbed soil was 4. 53 compared to 5. 83 of undisturbed <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> Open cast mining significantly (P< 0. 05) altered the soil pH from normal <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> Statistically insignificant deviation of soil Temperature, MC, OC, N and Mg in disturbed soil was observed. However, pH, P, K and Ca of disturbed <b>soil</b> varied from <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> significantly (P< 0. 05). The concentration of all the heavy metals studied viz.

25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark mountain <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the mountain meadow soils— above 1700m.

25|$|Igapó {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by sandy acidic soils that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water {{is due to the}} acidic organic humic substances (e.g. tannins) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”. Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal biomass. Várzea <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest phosphorus concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to anoxic conditions which limits plant growth.|$|E

We tested whether seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis experience edaphic constraints {{similar to their}} temperate counterparts.

We grew seedlings in a factorial experiment combining fumigation (to simulate nutrient release and soil pasteurization by fire), soil type (E. grandis forest versus rain <b>forest</b> <b>soil)</b> and phosphorus addition as factors.
