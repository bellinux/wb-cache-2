The vertical hangers were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled. Rails for trains and trams were laid, and road was surfaced using concrete topped with asphalt.

30|$|The lowest air {{pressure}} in the panel occurs {{at the end of}} the return roadway, not at the face return corner. A primary path for gas leakage is from the gob into the retained roadway. If the roadway is well sealed against the gob, the gas can accumulate in the gob end and gas concentrations there can be high. The Y-type ventilation system can easily lower gas concentrations in the gob and can contribute to gob <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> using buried <b>pipes.</b> A Y-type system can also reduce gas accumulation at the face return corner better than U-type ventilation, which can allow gas concentrations at the upper corner to exceed statutory limits (Yuan et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|Gas {{drainage}} {{has proven}} to be an effective method to control gas emission and outbursts of coal and gas in underground coal mining (Black and Aziz 2009; Yuan 2010; Karacan et al. 2011). Based on the simulation test, gas control measures were developed to manage gas issues in panel 1111 (1). These measures included mainly goaf <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> with buried <b>pipes</b> in the goaf, surface vertical wells, and cross-measure boreholes. The return air volume was 2290 – 2700  m 3 /min during <b>gas</b> <b>drainage</b> period. Gas concentration in return air was less than 0.6  %. Gas extraction rate in the working face was more than 60  %. The average gas extraction rate was 70  %. With these gas control measures, panel 1111 (1) was mined without encountering any gas-related safety issues. With stress relief mining of No. 11 - 2 coal seam, the protected area of No. 13 coal seam was extensively de-stressed and de-gassed. The risk of coal and gas outburst during both development of headings and panel extraction was minimized, and a significant gain was achieved in the production of panel 1111 (1).|$|R
40|$|Landfills {{remain an}} {{attractive}} disposal route for {{municipal solid waste}} because in most cases it is more economical than other alternatives such as incineration and composting. The post-closure development of landfilled areas becomes essential as urban growth reaches landfill boundaries. However, physicochemical and biological processes inevitably hinder the beneficial use of such lands because of gas and leachate generation coupled with significant settlement. The rate and magnitude of landfill deformations are often nonuniform resulting in differential settlements that can have devastating effects on the integrity of any structure erected on the landfill. Differential settlements also eventually result in problems such as surface ponding, development of cracks, and failure of the cover system, including tearing of geomembrane, as well as damage of <b>gas</b> collection and <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes.</b> The ability to predict settlement becomes a key issue {{in the design and}} construction of landfills. Numerous models have been developed to simulate the movement of solid waste. This article presents a critical review of such models, describes the applicability and usage of these models, and discusses the necessity to develop a multiphase, multicomponent comprehensive model integrating gas generation, leachate movement, and refuse settlement...|$|R

The street was the first to be made by the Board and was completed in 1864. It was driven across a densely occupied part of the parish and crosses older roads and streets which created oddly shaped plots for redevelopment. Its junction with Borough High Street is so gently curved that the transition between the streets leads to confusion and imprecision as to which is which and the street numbering and lack of a street name plate compounds this, the break between them occurs at the junction with Bedale Street on the north-side but at the south-side the street does not begin until after the 'fork' opposite Stoney Street, some 130 metres to the west. Under the street, a tunnel was constructed with side passages to carry utilities such as <b>gas,</b> water, and <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes,</b> together with telegraph wires for communication.

40|$|Abstract. This paper classifies {{the tunnel}} frost damages and {{discusses}} their causes, especially {{the causes of}} lining structural damage for freezing and they are classified into two categories: the outer freezing damage and the inner freezing damage of lining. The analysis shows that the former has a {{little effect on the}} structure, but the latter has big threat. For the phenomenon that cracks frequently occur in the tunnel lining of cold regions, some measures to prevent cracks are presented, including reducing adverse constraints in the process of temperature change and preventing large temperature stress. In cold regions, it is unsuitable to adopt back paste-type water-stops to prevent the leakage from lining construction joints, and a good choice is to utilize the buried drainage water-stops. The ring <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> directly connect with the central <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe,</b> and thermal insulating layer with belt shape is set along the ring <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> in some sections where surrounding rock is water-rich and the middle and lower part of the ring <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> are easily frozen.
