5|$|Michael Alexander writes that, as a translator, Pound was {{a pioneer}} with a great gift of {{language}} and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu, and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> them alive {{at a time when}} poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.|$|E

5|$|The show's 15,000th episode {{focused on}} Ruth contemplating whether to consummate her affair with {{herdsman}} Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs), after believing David was having his own affair with his ex-girlfriend Sophie Barlow (Moir Leslie). Ruth ultimately chose {{to return home}} to her family. The storyline, which had begun in 2004, was heavily criticised by listeners, who inundated the BBC with complaints. Low listener figures were also attributed to the storyline, while the editor Vanessa Whitburn said the backlash <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> Ruth faithful to David.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing them together to perform live. When the band performed together, they would do so acoustically, so each member could hear the nuances of the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, {{pastry chef}} {{to the future}} Louis XVIII, opened {{one of the most}} popular {{restaurants}} of the time – the Grande Taverne de Londres – in the arcades of the Palais-Royal. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the French Directory's nouveau riche <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> these new restaurants in business.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Who's concerts that included Tommy was overwhelmingly positive. The touring <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts. Several live recordings of Tommy from the Who's 1969–70 tours have been released. A complete performance {{is available on the}} 2002 Deluxe Edition of the live album Live at Leeds, recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, released in 1996. The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum. Portions of the Woodstock performance of Tommy were released on the Woodstock film and later on The Kids Are Alright. The complete show was recorded, but has never been officially released.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} website had over 11,000 {{responses to a}} poll asking listeners whether Ruth should go with Sam, compared to the usual 3,000. Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that she was not the type to have an affair.|$|E
5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Narimantas was {{the second}} son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb {{and went on to}} rule Pinsk, Polotsk, and – as his {{patrimony}} by invitation of Novgorod's nobles – Ladoga, Oreshek and Korela. He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian mercenary service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477 and <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> Moscow at bay. In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis. There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack credibility. After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Strėva in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including Kurakin and Galitzine.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{hardware}} units under Iwata's tenure, {{including the}} Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, {{were not as}} successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon {{the release of the}} Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12percent on July29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he misread the market and did not appropriately account for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.|$|E

5|$|The Public Theater {{struggled}} {{to raise the}} $5.5million budgeted for the Broadway transfer, because {{of the severity of}} the economic recession in late 2008, but it reached its goal by adding new producing partners. Director Diane Paulus <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> costs low by using an inexpensive set. The show grossed a healthy $822,889 in its second week. On April 30, 2009 on the Late Show with David Letterman, the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Revival of a Musical. By August 2009, the revival had recouped its entire $5,760,000 investment, becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history. Its cast album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} {{spring and early summer}} of 1967 the {{battalion}} <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> open Route 9, the supply route between Ca Lu Combat Base and Khe Sanh. After a firefight between a PAVN battalion and Mike Company in late July, the road was closed until 1968. The battalion was also stricken by malaria during this time; 206 3rd Battalion Marines contracted it. In the fall the battalion was put to work building and defending the McNamara Line, a series of fixed fortifications along the DMZ in an area known as Leatherneck Square (The four corners were Cam Lộ, Con Thien, Gio Linh and Đông Hà). The PAVN repeatedly attacked the positions and twice 3rd Battalion had to come rescue elements of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines that were in danger of being overrun. 3rd Battalion would occupy several of those positions through May 1968. From 29 December to 12 January elements of the battalion participated in the construction and defense of strongpoint Alpha 3.|$|E
5|$|A star in Stan Kenton's famous {{orchestra}} in the 1940s and 1950s, {{as well as}} that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and {{winner of}} numerous awards, Manne slipped from public view as jazz became less central in popular music. In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he <b>helped</b> <b>keep</b> jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard. There, the house band was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others. Stan Getz was the last to be featured (at a briefly occupied second location at Tetou's restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard), when, late in 1973, Manne was forced to close the club for financial reasons.|$|E
