40|$|The {{effect of}} {{individual}} and combined addition of both nanosilica (NS) and polycarboxylate-ether plasticizer (PCE) admixtures on aerial lime mortars was studied. The sole incorporation of NS increased the water demand, as proved by the mini-spread flow test. An interaction between NS and hydrated lime particles was observed in fresh mixtures by means of particle size distribution studies, zeta potential measurements and optical microscopy, giving rise to agglomerates. On the other hand, the addition of PCE to a lime mortar increased the flowability and accelerated the setting process. PCE was shown to act in lime media as a <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent,</b> reducing the particle size of the agglomerates through a steric hindrance mechanism. Mechanical strengths were improved {{in the presence of}} either NS or PCE, the optimum being attained in the combined presence of both admixtures that involved relevant microstructural modifications, as proved by pore size distributions and SEM observations...|$|E

Alcohol acted as the mutual solvent and HCl as the <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent.</b> In the absence of HCl, precipitation of colloidal particles was encountered on the addition of any water to the alkoxide. The gels were subjected to various thermal treatments and characterized by differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. After drying at 400 C, the gels were amorphous to x-rays. The amorphous powder crystallized into the low-temperature orthorhombic form of Nb 2 O 5 at approximately 500 C, which transformed irreversibly into the high-temperature monoclinic alpha-Nb 2 O 5 between 900 to 1000 C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{laboratory and}} in situ studies {{carried out on}} a 200 000 m(3) large clayey silt compacted embankment. Laboratory studies carried out on undeformed block samples included index tests, strength tests and water retention curves using the filter paper technique. Grain size analyses with and without a <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent</b> clearly showed the existence of grain clusters, which appear to be naturally formed. Field instrumentation installed at depths from 0. 25 m to 1. 0 m included tensiometers, equitensiometers, time domain reflectometry and geothermometers. Pluviometer data from a nearby weather station are also used to analyse the field data. The ranges of water content and suction values were measured, both of which correlated well with the pluviometer data.

40|$|The {{authors have}} studied the Jukuka process from the view-points of soil physics, soil {{mechanics}} and chemistry. It {{is important to recognize}} the grain size distribution as one of the physical indices. At first we investigated the <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agents</b> and, the initial water contents of samples which dispersed the soil particles best. We used four kinds of <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agents,</b> NaOH, (NaPO 3) 6, HCl and NH 4 OH, and the samples presented here were two kinds of volcanic ash sub-soil and two kinds of non-volcanic ash sub-soil. Each of them is composed of soils before land reclaimed to paddy fields, two years later, five years later and ten years later (in case of volcanic ash sub-soil eight years later). In this mechanical analysis, we used the Hydrometer method. Therefore the results obtained are as follows. In the volcanic ash ~oil the dispersion is affected by the initial water contents comparatively and the highest dispersed soil contains about 10 - 15 % more clay than the lowest one, as shown in Fig 1, Fig 3. Concerning Kanto loam (volcanic ash soil), HCl showed the best dispersion before land reclaimed to paddy fields, but(NaPO 3) 6 Showed best later, as shown in Fig 1. On the other hand in the non-volcanic ash soil the dispersion efficiency does not differ with their initial water contents, and most particles are dispersed by (NaPO 3) 6 and NaOH, as shown in Fig 5...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} pour an earthen {{material}} in a liquid state, as a concrete, technologies used by concrete and ceramic industries {{can be transferred}} to the field of earthen construction. Two different methods should be employed simultaneously. The first relates to theories of grain packing that have led to models of Apollonian packing and spaced packing, commonly used for the development of cement concrete (ultra high performance concrete and self-leveling concrete). It concerns the optimization of the granular skeleton of natural materials. The second relates to the dispersion of the colloidal fraction of earthen materials. In natural soils, clays are organized as porous aggregates composed of several tens of particles. These aggregates trap water that is not used to liquefy the mixture.

Thermal evolution of the physical and structural changes in the gel was monitored by differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. On heating to approximately 400 C, the amorphous gel crystallized into the low temperature orthorhombic phase Beta-Ta 2 O 5, which transformed into the high temperature tetragonal phase Alpha-Ta 2 O 5 when further heated to approximately 1450 C.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of Fenton treatment for sludge reduction through the implication of a <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent</b> citric acid, for the exclusion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from waste-activated sludge (WAS), was investigated. Deflocculation was achieved with 0. 06 g/g suspended solids (SS) of citric acid dosage. Fenton optimization studies using response surface methodology (RSM) revealed that 0. 5 and 0. 0055 g/g SS were the optimal dosages of H 2 O 2 and Fe 2 +. The addition of a cation-binding agent set the pH value of sludge to 5 which {{did not affect the}} Fenton efficiency. The results presented in this study shows the advantage of deflocculating the sludge as SS and volatile suspended solids (VSS) reductions were found to be higher in the deflocculated (53 and 63 %, respectively) than in the flocculated (22 and 34 %, respectively) sludges. Kinetic investigation of the treatment showed that the rate of the reaction was four times higher in the deflocculated sludge than control. The methodology reported in this manuscript was successfully applied to a real case were the deflocculated mediated Fenton process reduced the sludge disposal cost from 297. 8 to 61. 9 US dollars/ton of sludge...|$|E
40|$|An effort {{had been}} made to {{fabricate}} composite of (1 -x) wt% Al: x wt % Al 2 O 3 (where x = 0, 10, 20 30, 40, and 50) using both gel casting and powder metallurgy techniques To the best of our knowledge, there was no such literature available on Al-Al 2 O 3 composites prepared through gel-casting technique. Prior to gel-casting zeta-potential, concentration of <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent,</b> and viscosity were optimized. A mould was designed and fabricated and a new processing route was employed to produce a homogeneous green body which was successful. Microstructure implies that the sintered body was highly porous which could not provide enough mechanical strength. However, the green product was easily machinable. XRD analysis shows no sign of oxidation of aluminium. It has to be further studied before using it for the production. In powder metallurgy, to attain proper mixing aluminium and alumina in their powdered form are milled for 1 h in a planetary milling machine with isopropyl alcohol as the wetting agent. Powders were pressed to samples of different shape and were sintered under vacuum. Normally such composites are sintered at nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Some attachments for were designed and manufactured {{that could be used in}} the tubular furnace to obtain vacuum. The design was successful and was able to produce a vacuum pressure of 5. 6 E- 6 mbars inside the tube. It had been found that by reinforcing with 20 % alumina the hardness of aluminium was increased to 35 HV. Bending test gives the indication that the plasticity is reduced slowly by the addition of alumina into aluminium matrix. It was also found that the tribological properties can be improved by adding 20 weight % of alumina into the metal. Microstructure indicates that the alumina was well dispersed in the aluminium matrix. The composite is easily machinable with HSS tool with minimum tool wear. Therefore it can be used to replace materials in various automotive, aerospace, and automobile industries...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{new uses}} for {{residues}} of industries that process {{large quantities of}} biomass, as in bioethanol production, is essential for a sustainable development with reduced impact on the environment, which {{is the reason why}} many efforts have been devoted to find noble uses for lignins. in this study, a lignin obtained from sugarcane bagasse in a bioethanol producing plant was carboxymethylated to yield the water-soluble carboxymethyl lignin (CML), which was then used as stabilizing agent in aqueous alumina (Al 2 O 3) suspensions. CML had a degree of substitution 0. 46 +/- 0. 01, in relation to the C 9 unit of lignin, and behaved as a polyelectrolyte in a large pH range owing to the dissociation of carboxylic groups. The action of CML as stabilizing agent of alumina aqueous suspensions was investigated using viscometry, zeta potential, and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) measurements, mainly as a function of pH and time. Overall, the results showed that CML had a good performance as a <b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent,</b> because it led to dispersions with low viscosity and small change in particle size as a function of time. The positive effect from the addition of CML was confirmed in the morphological features of the material obtained from the alumina suspensions after elimination of water, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy. The stabilization of alumina suspensions afforded by CML opens the way for similar applications of modified lignins, whose electrical and structural properties may be tuned for specific uses in various industries, including the ceramic industry.

30|$|The shales, Okitipupa (SW) and Enugu (SE) were {{air-dried}} for 3  weeks {{as opposed}} to the faster oven drying to obtain reliable results (because some clays undergo irreversible changes when oven dried at temperature of 100 – 110  °C). They were subsequently subjected to grain size analysis, specific gravity and consistency limits tests in accordance with BSI 1377 (1990) test procedures with slight modifications where necessary to provide an understanding of their index properties and enable classification. For example, in the determination of grain size analysis wet sieving was adopted with about 500  g of air-dried crushed shale mixed with distilled water and calgon (<b>deflocculating</b> <b>agent)</b> stirred for about 20  min for effective dispersal of the soil grains. For completeness of investigation effective segregation of soil grains was achieved through constant agitation. The wet suspension was then passed through a 63 um sieve to separate the coarse fraction from the fines fraction. CBR tests were performed on compacted samples in both unsoaked and soaked conditions. The CBR which is a semi empirical strength test is the ratio of the load that causes a penetration of 2.5 or 5.00  mm of a standard plunger in a sample to the standard load that causes similar penetrations of the same plunger respectively in a 13.24 KN and 19.96 KN California sample. Readings of load taken at penetration intervals of 0.25 – 7.50  mm were plotted to generate a load deformation curve. Soaking of the samples in water was done for 24  h in accordance with the Nigerian general specification (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing 1997) before the determination of the soaked CBR to simulate natural conditions and assess {{the extent to which the}} ingress of water would expand and weaken the soils. Varying quantities of 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20  % of both Rice husk and Coconut husk ash (by weight) separately was added to the shales and mixed thoroughly to allow for intimate mixing. The mixed samples were left for 48  h to cure and subsequently remixed to achieve a homogenous mix prior to compaction at Modified AASHTO level of compaction. The Modified AASHTO compaction was desirable because it is usually achievable with conventional field equipment. Moreover as indicated by Mohamedzein et al. (2005), shale can withstand higher energy level without mechanical instability. Hence compaction at Modified AASHTO was achieved using air dried samples weighing 6  kg mixed thoroughly with 6  kg of water. The material was compacted into a pre-weighed mould in 5 layers with each layer subjected to 55 blows of a 4.5  kg rammer falling through a height of 0.45  m uniformly. The process was repeated for all the five portions and then repeated after the addition of the ashes at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20  %. In the determination of the UCS all the samples were cured for 7  days and were compacted at OMC to simulate field moisture compaction conditions. The samples compacted at OMC were taken in the form of cylinder which was later reduced to the required size of 76  mm long by 38  mm diameter and then loaded on the triaxial machine. The machine loads the cylindrical sample by moving the piston rod downward at a constant rate, after which the load that corresponds to the deformation were measured and read from a steel proving ring until the sample failed. Stress results were obtained through the applied force divided by cross sectional area of the sample while the strain was obtained through change in the original sample length. Calculations of stress and strain were plotted to determine the UCS. The consistency of the different mixtures was also determined to obtain the influence on plasticity index. Total abundances of the major oxides and several minor elements of the shale samples, rice husk ash (RHA) and coconut husk ash (CHA) were analysed by Induced Coupled Plasma-Emission Spectrometry (ICP-ES). The prepared samples were digested to complete dryness with an acid solution of (2 : 2 : 1 : 1) H 2 O-HF-HClO 4 -HNO 3. 50  % HCl was added to the residue and heated using a mixing hot block. After cooling the solutions were transferred to test-tubes and brought to volume using dilute HCl while sample splits of 0.25  g were analyzed. Furthermore the mineralogical composition of the soils was determined using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) at the Acme Laboratories, Vancouver, Canada. Powdered samples of the soil were pelletized and sieved to 0.074  mm. These were later mixed with acetone to produce a thin slurry and each sample mixture was applied to a glass was scanned through the Siemens D 500 Diffractometer (using MDI Data Scan and JADE 8 softwares) for the determination of XRD.|$|E
