40|$|Voters {{who believe}} that the nation's economy has been {{worsening}} are more inclined to vote against the incumbent president than are those who believe it has not been getting worse. This relationship could be present because voters condition their support for the <b>incumbents</b> <b>upon</b> their perceptions of the economy, or, alternatively, because they condition their perceptions of the economy upon their underlying, partisan-based support of the incumbents. If the latter, economic perceptions in mass publics would be more a function of partisan rationalization than of the actual performance of the economy. However, the analyses reported here, based upon a pooled sample of respondents interviewed by the American National Election Studies between 1968 and 2008, provide strong evidence of the former scenario, not the latter. Perceptions of economic trends clearly and accurately track actual changes in GDP and unemployment. Bias due to partisanship is minor. ...|$|R

Among other changes, it introduced a provision that would prove to be crucial in the Oyama case – namely, it stated that if a person purchased land in another person’s name, it would be presumed that this was done with intent to bypass the Alien Land Law. This was a significant shift in the rules regarding burden of proof in state escheat cases involving land. Whereas before the State would have to prove its case, this was no longer the situation – it was now <b>incumbent</b> <b>upon</b> the defendant to prove that the purchased land was a bona fide gift rather than an attempt at getting around the land ownership restrictions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Incumbent</b> inertia <b>upon</b> {{disruptive}} {{change in}} the airline industry: Causal factors for routine rigidity and top management moderators In the face of disruptive innovations, incumbent firms frequently encounter substantial rigidity in business routines. Our article investigates the role of top management teams to overcome this inertia. Based on a literature review including strategy, organizational and psychological research fields, we conducted four case studies in the European airline industry and collected data from qualitative interviews with senior executives. As a result, we find new causal factors for routine rigidity in four groups, namely knowledge insufficiencies, inadequate self-concept, inflexibilities and financial concerns. Further, we propose a comprehensive set of top management team characteristics along individual members, team structure and team process, which influence {{the impact of the}} identified causal factors to ultimately lower routine rigidity. Our findings uniquely link existing research streams and allow practitioners to better prepare incumbent firms for future disruptive change. ...|$|R
