5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. <b>Few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E

For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} starfish are gonochorous, there being {{separate}} {{male and female}} individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm {{at the same time}} and in a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> the same gonad, called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterina gibbosa start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as Nepanthia belcheri, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.|$|E
5|$|Oda (or Odo; died 958), {{called the}} Good or the Severe, was a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury in England. The {{son of a}} Danish invader, Oda became Bishop of Ramsbury before 928.

After being named to Canterbury in 941, Oda was instrumental in crafting royal legislation as well as involved in providing rules for his clergy. Oda was also involved in the efforts to reform religious life in England. He died in 958 and legendary tales afterwards were ascribed to him.

5|$|Each of Sweden's 21 {{counties}} (län), 25 provinces (landskap) and 290 municipalities (kommun) {{has its own}} coat of arms. The Instrument of Government (1634) {{introduced the}} modern counties of Sweden, superseding the 25 medieval provinces. Although many of these counties {{have been the subject}} of more recent reforms, many of them occupy broadly similar regions. (See comparative maps at Counties of Sweden.) Most of the counties that have remained largely intact (Dalarna, Gotland, Skåne, Södermanland, Uppsala, Värmland, etc.) retain the respective province's coat of arms, while the redistricting of other lands has been reflected heraldically (e.g. the newly created Gävleborgs län, occupying parts of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, bears their arms quarterly). By royal decree on 18 January 1884, King Oscar II granted all provinces the rights to the rank of duchy and to display their arms with a ducal coronet. While more exhaustive lists can be found elsewhere, this article only discusses the arms of a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> regions, selected for their heraldic notability. The arms of Gotland, Västerbotten, Uppland, Södermanland, Skåne and Lappland will be considered here in further detail.|$|E
5|$|Medieval England {{produced}} art in {{the form}} of paintings, carvings, books, fabrics and many functional but beautiful objects. A wide range of materials was used, including gold, glass and ivory, the art usually drawing overt attention to the materials utilised in the designs. Anglo-Saxon artists created carved ivories, illuminated manuscripts, embroidered cloths, crosses and stone sculpture, although relatively <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have survived to the modern period. They produced a wide range of metalwork, frequently using gold and garnets, with brooches, buckles, sword hilts and drinking horns particularly favoured designs. Early designs, such as those found at the Sutton Hoo burial, used a zoomorphic style, heavily influenced by German fashions, in which animal shapes were distorted into flowing shapes and positioned alongside geometric patterns. From the 7th century onwards more naturalistic designs became popular, showing a plasticity of form and incorporating both animals and people into the designs. In the 10th century, Carolingian styles, inspired by Classical imagery, began to enter from the continent, becoming widely used in the reformed Benedictine monasteries across the south and east of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.|$|E
