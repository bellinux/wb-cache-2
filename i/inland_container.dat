By doing so, {{the aim of the}} thesis was to highlight the parameters of the inland waterway system as well as cost parameters for <b>inland</b> ships carrying <b>containers.</b> The master thesis was compiled in order to answer the following questions properly: Can inland ships provide market-oriented and competitive solutions for the transportation of containers from sea ports to European markets and which cost parameters have {{to be taken into account}} for <b>inland</b> ships carrying <b>containers?</b> How does a river information system (RIS) support inland ships by making it more attractive for shippers and forwarders? Regarding transportation of containers from sea ports to inland, which parameters of the inland waterway system are of significance and determining? Applying intelligent information systems and planning techniques combined with a growing network of intermodal terminals, inland ships offer innovative and competitive solutions by being an integrated transport system, providing tailor-made and door-todoor logistics services. Considering that road and rail transport are already suffering from chronic congestion, inland waterways' key competitiveness lies in its congestionfree network. However, the infrastructure of the inland waterway network does only meet regionally the requirements for an efficient and seamless container transport and therefore hampers the potential of the inland waterway network as a whole.

Therefore, the problem studied here {{is closely related to}} the vehicle routing problem with backhauls (VRPB) that finds an optimal set of orders (or routes) visiting deliveries (linehauls) and pickups (backhauls).

This means that in one route two, three or four nodes, can be visited, which is equivalent to the problem of matching pickup and delivery nodes in single routes which provide a total travel distance shorter than in the case when nodes are visited separately. In this paper we formulate the problem of matching customer nodes in the container distribution and collecting processes as multiple matching IP, and for the problems of larger sizes we propose a heuristic approach based on matching utilities.

40|$|At present, {{less than}} 2 % of the {{hinterland}} traffic to the harbour of Zeebrugge is carried by inland navigation, {{due to the}} insufficient capacity of inland waterway connections. An alternative could be offered by estuary vessels, i. e. inland vessels strengthened and equipped for safe operation between the Belgian coastal harbours and the West Scheldt in favourable weather and wave conditions. However, the window determined by the present regulations of the Belgian Shipping Inspectorate is too restrictive, traffic being impossible for 60 days a year on average. Accordingly, the Belgian federal authorities have recently prepared new regulations, based on probabilistic design procedures, including a risk analysis with respect to criteria which take due account of the limitations inherent {{to the design of}} inland vessels.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{growth in the}} volume of international trade poses considerable economic and sustainability challenges, particularly as transport routes become more congested and concern grows {{about the role of}} transport movements in accelerating climate change. Rail freight {{plays a major role in}} the <b>inland</b> transport of <b>containers</b> passing through the main British container ports, and potentially could play a more significant role in the future. However, there is little detailed understanding of the nature of this particular rail market, especially in terms its current operating efficiency. This paper examines container train service provision to/from the four main ports, based on analysis of a representative survey of more than 500 container trains between February and August 2007. The extent to which the existing capacity is utilised is presented, and scenarios by which the number of containers carried could be increased without requiring additional train service provision are modelled, to identify the theoretical potential for greater rail volumes. Finally, the paper identifies the challenges involved in achieving higher load factors, emphasising the importance both of wider supply chain considerations and government policy decision-making. 1...|$|R
