Therefore researchers started to investigate modulations of the core structure to develop better agonists than melatonin; more potent, with better pharmacokinetics and longer half-life. TIK-301 (figure 1) is an agonist of the early classes. It is very similar to melatonin and has made it to clinical trials. This led to further research on the molecule, mainly substitution of the aromatic ring. Various modulations showed promising activity, especially the naphthalene ring which is present in agomelatine (figure 1). Other ring systems have also showed melatonin agonist activity. Amongst them are <b>indane</b> which is present in ramelteon (figure 1) and the ring system of tasimelteon (figure 1).|$|E
25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), <b>indane</b> (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this doctoral thesis include the following: 1) The development of multicatalytic systems that combines the complementary advantages of organocatalysis and transition metals {{within a single}} reaction pot. 2) The development of novel organocatalytic domino reactions that allow the generation of cascade products with multiple stereogenic centres. In {{the first part of}} the doctoral research, C 3, C 2 - unsubstituted indole substrates were chosen for the development of single pot annulation strategies since indole is well known to possess multiple positional reactivities. Tapping upon this unique property of indoles, o-alkyne nitroolefin substrates were synthesized and tested in a sequential organo-/ Au(I) catalyzed sequential reaction. Interestingly, tetracyclic seven membered ring containing indole derivatives could be successfully synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities with this sequential methodology. Moreover, our methodology also exploits the C 2 electrophilicity of the indole substrate, where a postulated Wagner-Meerwein type ring expansion methodology allowed the access of such medium ring products which are challenging if a pure organocatalytic methodology is used. In addition, biologically active tetrahydrocarbazoles could be accessed using an organocatalyzed/ Ag(I) mediated sequential one-pot strategy by the skillful selection of an iodo-nitroolefin substrate. In this protocol, a first organocatalyzed Friedel-Crafts type Michael addition of indoles allows the incorporation of stereogenic information into the product. The Ag(I) additive allows the thermodynamic abstraction of the iodide from the substrate, hence driving the Ciamician-Plancher rearrangement reaction which is rarely utilized in the literature. Furthermore, the first concise enantioselective three step total synthesis of a 5 -HT 6 receptor antagonist was accessed using this methodology. In the second part of the doctoral research, o-carbaldehyde nitroolefins were used to evoke a Michael/Henry domino reaction to access poly-functionalized <b>indanes</b> enantioselectively. One project required the use of C 3, C 2 -unsubstituted indoles as a nucleophilic trigger to start the domino reaction. It was discovered that our cascade product furnished a cis-vicinal relative configuration which is different from other base catalyzed domino reactions known in literature which forms the all trans-vicinal <b>indanes.</b> This was attributed to the fact that hydrogen bonding catalysts can direct the domino reaction to form a cis-oriented transition state which allows access to the cis-vicinal product in the Henry cyclization step. Moreover, the kinetic product formed in our methodology can be easily epimerized using a strong base to the thermodynamic product. The last project is the utility of N-Boc-oxindoles as a nucleophile in a Michael/Henry domino reaction which forms <b>indanes</b> bearing four contiguous stereogenic centres. The investigation showed that only 0. 5 mol% catalyst loading of a quinine-derived squaramide is required to generate such molecular complexity and most of the examples in the methodology only required 45 minutes towards completion. Hence the frontier of organocatalytic domino reactions were pushed to the limits comparable to transition metal catalysis...|$|R
