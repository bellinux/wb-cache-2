We focus on the integration of this process in flows leading to shallow emitters and screen printed front contacts and to deep, highly ohmic emitters in association with Cu contacts. The inherent advantage of this process, beside high throughput, is the external gettering performed by full emitter etch at the rear side. This is particularly relevant {{in the case of}} two-step emitter formation process, where removal of phosphorus diffused layers is most effective when performed prior to the high temperature drive-in step. Another effect that we make use of is the front-side emitter etch back performed by the etch bath vapors, which can be used to tune the phosphorus surface concentration and thus the emitter sheet resistance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In most {{industrial}} type {{solar cell}} processes the edge isolation {{is an important}} step. After most emitter diffusion techniques, especially the POCl 3 diffusion, the front contact is connected with the back contact through the <b>emitter</b> around the <b>edge</b> of the solar cell.

All these technologies are compared concerning their impact on the solar cell performance of industrial type screen printed solar cells. Using IV measurement (illuminated and dark), laser beam induce current (LBIC) and lock-in thermography it is shown that isolation by laser still suffers from too low fill factors and sawing, grinding, or plasma etching are preferable.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to producing VCSELs, {{in contrast to}} the production process of edge-emitting lasers. Edge-emitters cannot be tested {{until the end of the}} production process. If the edge-emitter does not function properly, whether due to bad contacts or poor material growth quality, the production time and the processing materials have been wasted. VCSELs however, can be tested at several stages throughout the process to check for material quality and processing issues. For instance, if the vias, the electrical connections between layers of a circuit, have not been completely cleared of dielectric material during the etch, an interim testing process will flag that the top metal layer is not making contact to the initial metal layer. Additionally, because VCSELs emit the beam perpendicular to the active region of the laser as opposed to parallel as with an <b>edge</b> <b>emitter,</b> tens of thousands of VCSELs can be processed simultaneously on a three-inch gallium arsenide wafer. Furthermore, even though the VCSEL production process is more labor and material intensive, the yield can be controlled to a more predictable outcome.|$|R

Quantum well (QW) saturable absorbers have been extensively studied for the mode-locking of solid state lasers, fully integrated semiconductor <b>edge</b> <b>emitter</b> lasers and Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VECSELs). Other researchers have shown the advantage of using the excitons in QWs to improve the performance in edge emitting mode-locked lasers [1].

CNT on porous alumina were synthesized using ferrocene as a single source precursor in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. In order to influence the number density of CNT emitters and their anchoring, the pore diameter of the alumina templates was varied between 20 and 200 nm. The field emission performance of such CNT cathodes of some ten mm 2 size was integrally measured in a spacer-free diode configuration with luminescent screen, and the current distribution has been derived by means of developed image analysis software, which utilizes a calibration of the light intensity as function of the current. A strong increase of the integral dc current density has been found for pore diameters below 60 nm. The current distribution and conversion results in maximum local values of 108 mA/cm 2 at 7 V/µm (dc). In pulsed mode, peak values of up to 0. 2 A/cm 2 at 11. 5 V/µm averaged over several mm 2 size have been achieved with much improved luminescence and homogeneity of the emission which is, as demonstrated, suitable for light source applications.      The high current carrying capability of the CNT emitters on porous alumina was confirmed by local measurements with a field emission scanning microscope (FESM), which provided Fowler-Nordheim-like (FN) currents of up to 19 µA from single emitters. FESM voltage scans show high emitter number densities of up to 60000 /cm 2 at E < 20 V/µm. It was found that both field enhancement factors (β) and emitter number densities are strongly dependent on the CVD growth conditions. Moreover, sparse emitters with comparably low average β ~ 300 are preferable for high current densities, rather than those which are densely grown with β ~ 1100. Single CNT emitters on porous alumina have shown fluctuations, long-term instabilities, and strong (~ 50 %) current drift over some hours. Resolved in a ms time scale the emission current reveal a switching between several electronic states, which {{is caused by the}} adsorbates. Cathode processing at different pressures and currents results in much improved current stability of ± 10 % as measured over 18 hours.      First experiments on copper NW with different geometrical properties, electrochemically grown in the etched ion-tracked pores of polymers, resulted in an emission site density of up to 1. 4 x 10 5 cm - 2 at 6 V/µm.
