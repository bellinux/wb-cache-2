5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability <b>for</b> <b>users</b> to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E

5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common <b>for</b> <b>users</b> to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code <b>for</b> <b>users</b> to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E

They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.|$|E

40|$|Using Beijing as an example, this {{research}} demonstrates that smartcard {{data can be}} used to (a) assemble the required data for excess commuting studies, and (b) visualise related results. Based on both smartcard and household travel survey data, we find that the theoretical minimum commute is considerably lower <b>for</b> bus <b>users</b> than <b>for</b> car <b>users</b> in Beijing. This suggests that there is a greater inter-mixing of jobs–housing functions (i. e., a better jobs–housing balance) associated with users of that mode compared to the corresponding land-use arrangement <b>for</b> car <b>users,</b> who locate further from the central area (Tian’anmen) than bus users. The commuting range <b>for</b> car <b>users</b> is 9. 4 km greater than <b>for</b> bus <b>users.</b> Excess commuting is slightly higher <b>for</b> bus <b>users</b> (69. 5 %) than <b>for</b> car <b>users</b> (68. 8 %). Commuting capacity values are slightly lower <b>for</b> car <b>users</b> than <b>for</b> bus <b>users,</b> implying that car users consume less of their available commuting resources overall than bus users, albeit only marginally...|$|R
