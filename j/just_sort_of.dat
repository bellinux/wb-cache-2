25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can <b>just,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|However, {{according}} to Jimmy Page, [...] "the track {{was done and}} then the producer, Simon Napier-Bell, just disappeared... <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> left me and Jeff to do it.

500|$|... "We {{needed someone}} to play {{keyboards}} for a song I did with Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben. Ben came to the session, and he can't really play keyboards very well-he's really more of a drummer-but after that day, we kept in touch, and we <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> clicked as writers.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote {{music to}} Age 13 slowed down to half its {{original}} playback speed. This {{allowed him to}} write an album's worth of music around the twenty-five minute film and [...] "made [...] flow better". Moore primarily worked alone in his home studio, recording short song ideas. [...] "I would place [...] inside a theme in the film, <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> audition things that might work, and something would click and I would develop the idea," [...] Moore said. In contrast to Moore's original plan to record an [...] "organic, and less digital" [...] album, all of the sounds on Graveyard Mountain Home are digital.|$|E

500|$|According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, the {{inspiration}} for [...] "Courageous" [...] came at the National Day of Prayer breakfast in 2008. Casting Crowns was performing at the event and Hall met with Alex Kendrick, {{who was also a}} part of the event. The two started talking about various topics until Hall told Kendrick about his church's Bible study program for fathers. Hall said that [...] "our hearts <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> joined on this passion to see men rise up and be the godly men of the house that God has called us to be". Kendrick mentioned that he wanted a song to be at the end credits of a movie and that [...] "lit [...] up".|$|E
500|$|The band {{then took}} a lengthy break to compose more tracks for Parachutes. A few months later, it was {{arranged}} that Allison and the band meet at a rehearsal room to finally begin production on the band's debut album. [...] "They started up playing in the rehearsal room and they really weren't together at all. And I was very honest with them, I <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> said 'Look, this simply isn't good enough'". Allison adds, [...] "The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out {{of the fact that}} we didn't end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written 'Yellow' by that time".|$|E
500|$|Mudhoney {{recorded}} the song at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, {{three months after}} the band's formation. Producer Jack Endino was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; [...] "for the most part, I <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stood back and let them go at it". Guitarist Steve Turner said that the band selected two of their [...] "grungiest" [...] songs for the single. [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] was to be the A-side of the single and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] the B-side before, in drummer Dan Peters's words, [...] "that all got flipped around".|$|E

500|$|American Pharoah's gentle {{demeanor}} is also distinctive, {{in that he}} is fond {{of people}} and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, [...] "Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet. They're <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> tough. If I brought Bayern out here, you can't get near him, he's too aggressive. 's just so different than any horse I've ever had." [...] He was not always so calm, described initially as [...] "a {{little bit of a}} headcase," [...] but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks, when [...] "all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for Barton Fink was smooth, they said, {{suggesting}} that the relief of being away from Miller's Crossing {{may have been a}} catalyst. They also felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story, which helped them move quickly through the composition. [...] "Certain films come entirely in one's head; we <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> burped out Barton Fink." [...] While writing, the Coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind: John Goodman, who had appeared in their 1987 comedy Raising Arizona. His new character, Charlie, was Barton's next-door neighbor in the cavernous hotel. Even before writing, the Coens knew how the story would end, and wrote Charlie's final speech {{at the start of the}} writing process.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning, two Ethiopian women, guests of Stevie Wonder, were brought into the {{recording}} studio—it had been decided that a portion of the proceeds raised would be used to bring aid to those affected by the recent famine in Ethiopia. They thanked the singers on behalf of their country, bringing several artists to tears, before being led from the room. Wonder attempted to lighten the mood, by joking that the recording session gave him a chance to [...] "see" [...] fellow blind musician Ray Charles. [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bumped into each other!" [...] The solo parts of the song were recorded without any problems. The final version of [...] "We Are the World" [...] was completed at 8am.|$|E

500|$|However, other songs contain {{subject matter}} and themes more typical of Green Day's {{previous}} work. Armstrong wrote [...] "Nice Guys Finish Last" [...] about the band's interactions with the band's lawyers and managers and how [...] "everybody thinks they know what's best for you." [...] "Jinx" [...] contains self-deprecating lyrics characteristic {{of many of the}} band's songs, while [...] "Prosthetic Head" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "typical ticked-off kiss-off". [...] "King for a Day" [...] {{tells the story of a}} cross-dresser. [...] "Uptight" [...] contains repeated mentions of suicide; Armstrong explained, [...] "I think the word 'suicide' just sounded really good. And the line, 'I'm a son of a gun'. It made sense, but I can't really explain why it made sense. It <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> does." ...|$|E
500|$|An Inconvenient Truth was {{scored by}} Michael Brook with an {{accompanying}} theme song played during the end credits by Melissa Etheridge. Brook {{explained that he}} wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: [...] "...in Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of give people a little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{of a lack}} of funding, Omar {{competed in}} {{equipment}} donated by the Sudanese team, lining up in a heat which included eventual gold medallist Veronica Campbell-Brown from Jamaica. Omar finished some nine seconds adrift of the other runners, with a time of 32.16. The crowd in the stadium gave a huge level of support to Omar, with journalist Charles Robinson saying [...] "I literally got goosebumps. They were <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> pushing her." [...] and The Guardian suggesting that she received a louder cheer than Campbell-Brown. The story of the Somali girl was picked up by the media prior to the race, but afterwards the interest died down due to the language barrier between Omar and the interviewers and because of her lack of interest in publicising herself.|$|E

500|$|She <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{sits there}} with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Between the Times and the Tides are {{composed}} in alternate guitar tunings, except [...] "Fire Island" [...] which is composed in standard tuning. Speaking {{of the use of}} tunings on the album, Ranaldo said [...] "they're all brand-new tunings on this album, none of them are from the Sonic Youth period. They're things that started happening, and you <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> roll with it." [...] He further explained that [...] "Fire Island" [...] was the first song he composed in standard tuning since Sonic Youth's debut EP, released in 1982. [...] "Waiting on a Dream", the album's opening track, contains a guitar riff that, according to Damian Fanelli, resembles The Rolling Stones' 1966song [...] "Paint It, Black" [...] and [...] "Tomorrow Never Comes", the album's closing track, references The Beatles' 1966song [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows." ...|$|E
