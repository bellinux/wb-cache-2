5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though {{the beginning of the}} annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December2012.|$|E

Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. The Stick of Truths production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, THQ, {{the rights to the}} game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|The Open Door is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. It was {{released}} on September 25, 2006, through Wind-up Records. The <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> for the record to be made available for purchase was in March 2006, but was changed {{as a result of}} guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, the loss of the band's former manager, and Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure from the group. The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by Dave Fortman.|$|E

25|$|Import {{substitution}} {{policies were}} adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s {{until the late}} 1980s. The <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> is largely attributed {{to the impact of}} the Great Depression of the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported primary products and imported almost all of the industrialized goods they consumed, were prevented from importing due to a sharp decline in their foreign sales.

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf.

Judge Akubzhanov then announced an <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest.

25|$|The harem wing {{was only}} added {{at the end}} of the 16th century. Many of the rooms and {{features}} in the Harem were designed by Mimar Sinan.

The structures expanded over time towards the Golden Horn side and evolved into a huge complex. The buildings added to this complex from its <b>initial</b> <b>date</b> of construction in the 15th century to the early 19th century capture the stylistic development of palace design and decoration. Parts of the harem were redecorated under the sultans Mahmud I and Osman III in an Italian-inspired Ottoman Baroque style. These decorations contrast with those of the Ottoman classical age.|$|E

After the explosion, Treblinka received only about 7,000 Jews from the capital for fear of similar incidents; the remaining 42,000 Warsaw Jews were deported to Majdanek, instead. The burning of unearthed corpses continued at full speed until the end of July.
