5|$|According to {{songwriter}} P. F. Sloan, Landy {{took advantage}} of Sloan's disappearance and claimed at one point {{to be the real}} P. F. Sloan. He explains that it was an attempt by Landy to gain credibility and appease members of the medical community who were questioning why Landy <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an appropriate songwriting collaborator for Wilson.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she {{was looking}} at him; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> equally <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not respond with a commonplace. He was silent.|$|R
60|$|Cadurcis' countenance fell; {{this was}} an {{obstacle}} which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> even <b>he</b> could not overcome.|$|R
60|$|Watty <b>felt</b> thankful <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{not quite}} slipped his cable, and said so.|$|R
5|$|Billy Homer (Andy Crowe) {{was also}} a {{recurring}} character. A tetraplegic, he is very competent with computer networks, sometimes hacking into the school's database. His storylines {{are some of the}} first representations of the Internet in British television. Moffat <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to sustain the character, and he appears only sporadically after the first series.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Loxton {{also became}} more disillusioned with cricket, as player {{behaviour}} deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder {{was known for}} his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his fellow administrators were losing control of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, then a Hauptmann (Captain), {{arrived at}} Wevelgem on 11 January 1943 {{to take over}} command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG26—26th Fighter Wing) from Major Josef Priller. Geißhardt's arrogance grated {{on some of the}} pilots, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> treated his fellow pilots who had not yet earned the Knight's Cross with too much disdain.|$|E
60|$|How splendidly this clear-headed, clear-eyed girl {{dominated}} the man! Lummox <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> REALLY <b>he</b> might renew her acquaintance! He did so.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a steady searching glance and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> had been insincere she would have found out.|$|R
60|$|All {{these things}} were against Stanley, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> {{did not make it}} quite clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was there he would soon not know where he was.|$|R
5|$|Graham Cole played PC Tony Stamp from 1987 to 2009. The {{character}} was written {{out of the}} series, taking up a driving instructor's post at Hendon, {{as part of the}} show's revamp, after producers <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't fit the style of the new show. Cole's last episode was shown on 5 November 2009 and his departure meant the end of a 22-year association with the programme.|$|E
5|$|In October 1864, delegates for {{confederation}} met in Quebec City for the Quebec Conference, {{where the}} Seventy-Two Resolutions were agreed to—they would {{form the basis}} of Canada's government. The Great Coalition was endangered by Taché's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
60|$|Davy was as yet {{far from}} repentance, {{but in his}} secret soul <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> perhaps, <b>he</b> had gone a little too far.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>he</b> {{remained}} longer, {{he would}} be unable to contain himself; and turning hastily away, walked off, accompanied by Surajah.|$|R
60|$|Did the {{instinct}} of love teach {{her how to}} mitigate his pain? Shefford <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the new-born strength in her.|$|R
5|$|In {{his final}} months, {{he sold his}} home in Poway, California, moving to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, some of his {{longtime}} friends <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in seclusion, embarrassed by what had happened with his life. In November 1990, Wiggins was hospitalized with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. After lapsing {{in and out of}} consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital on January 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac was {{developed}} following {{the release of}} Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When Super Meat Boy was released to both critical praise and strong sales, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{no longer had to}} worry about the consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered he could take further risk with the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing the Alps because he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's painting is relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon's clothes {{appear to have been}} researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.|$|E

5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was unable to}} resume regular teaching {{at that time and}} continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis {{felt that there was}} nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
60|$|They {{were great}} friends by this time. True, she {{knew little about}} him but she <b>felt</b> instinctively <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was manly and kind-hearted.|$|R
60|$|But the want {{of these}} things excused her. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> had not {{realised}} this he could never forgive her for the pain she caused him.|$|R
