Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't end up doing many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter that <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it. Things like that can bring me down. But it's not personal; some people just prefer to believe the worst about others at any given time." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains me most of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened to my sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> invention self-serving and sinister, and I take it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Cross Cafe in Mumbai was {{formerly}} Hitler's Cross cafe. The business sought {{to attract attention}} by using the Hitler theme, and was decorated with Nazi imagery. Actor Murli Sharma attended the opening party; when asked {{what he thought about}} the name, he said [...] "I am not really agitated as I have not read much about the man. However, from what I know about Hitler, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> name rather amusing." [...] Alternative names suggested included Stalin Samosa Shop, Ayatollah Khomeini's Falafels, and Kim Jong's Juicy Juice.|$|E
2500|$|Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss' {{contract}} when it {{expired in}} March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that [...] "No one, again, {{no one has}} called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley were going to start a new Kiss, and felt that he was getting too old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E
2500|$|With {{this new}} way of life, Bourguiba distanced from the other students, even with the Zouitens, {{supposed}} to be his future family-in-law and sightseeing in Paris. It was Habib, the brother of Chadlia Zouiten, who discovered his affair with Mathilde and wrote him a letter: [...] "I do not hide that <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> attitude a bit coward [...] you, {{who was supposed to}} marry my sister". But even in the neighbourhood, their relationship was very frowned and, to end gossips, Bourguiba elaborated a stratagem: He wore his costume and arrived in Mathilde's car, accompanied by Sfar and Guiga to simulate their wedding. All these changes seemed to have distanced him from his way of activism in Tunisia, despite the riots and uprising that started in the country, the resident-general ending up signing a decree to prohibit freedom of expression, but also censoring newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|... “A caste-ridden {{society and}} a bitter caste war {{is a very big}} {{inhibiting}} factor that has held the Left back. From the beginning, we never bothered about the caste factor. In the old days the Communists never bothered about this. We were all class-wallahs. Exploitation of one class by another class is okay. But exploitation of one caste by another caste was never a big factor in our minds. But in a Hindu society, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>this</b> [...] is the dominant thing – much more than class. We have a working class in the big industrial centres where we [...] were the dominant force among the workers, particularly at the trade union level. Big strikes were taking place. We were leading those strikes. But when it came to elections, the same worker who was carrying a red flag on his shoulders to get a higher salary or a bonus, would look towards his own caste.|$|E
