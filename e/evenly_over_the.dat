25|$|In the {{politics}} of the 1930s, Ryti was an important background figure. His social policy was two-minded. Ryti opposed work programmes for the unemployed and spending on assistance for poor. On the other hand, he thought that the benefits of the strong economics should be distributed <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole population, not just a few. Ryti played an important part in creating the social welfare of the late 1930s. In general, Ryti was opposed to state intervention in business and industry. He opposed Socialist economics and especially its Soviet forms. Furthermore, Ryti had experienced the Russification period and the Civil War, making him anti-Soviet. Ryti approved of neither German national socialism nor right-wing extremism, and he also opposed the Lapua movement. Ryti was an admirer of British civilisation and culture and of American free enterprise.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consisted of}} a modified Standard Class 7 boiler, with smaller steel cylinders and other modifications to save weight and hence increase route availability. [...] The wider firebox, designed for use with cheaper imported coal, was also utilised to spread its weight <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> axles, whilst the standard smokebox completed the boiler, which at 225lbf/in² was rated at a lower working pressure {{than that of the}} Britannias. [...] A single chimney was incorporated into the design, although this was to create problems later on, due to its small diameter, which reduced the choke area that allowed the fierce exhaust blast to escape, reducing the overall efficiency of the locomotive. Similarities with the Britannias rested with the frames, tenders and running gear, allowing easy standardisation of parts common with other classes. [...] The design was fitted with a standard set of two Walschaerts valve gear systems, and all members of the class were equipped with 4,200 gallon BR 1 tenders.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis of}} the Leader {{originated}} from a 1944 review of the Southern Railway's steam locomotive fleet, resulting in a Southern Railway design brief which called for a high-powered locomotive requiring little maintenance to replace the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines. The brief also stipulated that the locomotive would be used on both passenger and freight trains, requiring high route availability. Bulleid proposed an initial design [...] based on his SR Q1 class locomotive, which had proved easy to maintain in service. As the proposal progressed, Bulleid saw that certain tasks required with conventional steam locomotives could be eliminated by adopting some {{of the features of}} the contemporary Southern electric locomotives. However, one of the subsequent designs of a 0-4-4-0 wheel arrangement had an unacceptably high axle-loading of , which increased the risk of damaging the Southern Railway's track. By developing the proposal further, Bulleid settled for a 0-6-0+0-6-0 design of bogied tank locomotive, which spread the weight more <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rails and reduced the axle-loading.|$|E
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E

2500|$|To {{address this}} issue, CBAs {{since at least}} the 1990s have {{included}} what is now called the [...] "over-38 rule", under which certain contracts that extend past the player's 38th birthday are presumed to cover seasons following the player's expected retirement.

2500|$|In summer 1965, {{the first}} {{close-up}} pictures from Mars showed a cratered desert with {{no signs of}} water. However, over the decades, as more parts of the planet were imaged with better cameras on more sophisticated satellites, Mars showed evidence of past river valleys, lakes, and ice in glaciers and in the ground. It was discovered that the climate of Mars displays huge changes over geologic time because its axis is not stabilized by a large moon, as Earth's is. cycles: [...] A general circulation model study with simplified volatile schemes. J. Geophys. Res. 108. (E6). 5062. Also, some researchers maintain that water could exist for periods of time due to geothermal effects or asteroid impacts. One study found 205 possible closed-basin lakes in craters on Mars. The basins have an inlet valley that cuts the crater rim and flows into the basin, {{but they have no}} visible outlet valley. The total volume of the basins is equivalent to a depth of 1.2 meters spread <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Martian surface.

Some of these lakes had volumes similar to Earth's Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Lake Baikal.|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten pump stock and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|E
