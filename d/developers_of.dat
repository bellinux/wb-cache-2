5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the <b>developers</b> <b>of</b> an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
