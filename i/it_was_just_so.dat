500|$|Before the Clash began {{recording}} {{their second}} album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound {{than its predecessor}} {{in order to reach}} American audiences. Sandy Pearlman, known for his work with Blue Öyster Cult, was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, [...] "ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album... it ruined any spontaneity." [...] Strummer agreed that [...] "it wasn't our easiest session." [...] Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, Give 'Em Enough Rope received largely positive reviews upon its November release. It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the Billboard chart. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking [...] "Tommy Gun", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and the Innocents. The series of concerts—there were more than thirty, from Edinburgh to Portsmouth—was promoted as the Sort It Out Tour. The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] was {{originally}} meant {{to serve as}} the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by Robin Williams. Williams portrayed Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Several news sources indicated Williams took on the role as a favor to Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson, who directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). But Fontana said Williams agreed to take the part based on the actor's positive impression of both the show in general and the [...] "Bop Gun" [...] script in particular. Fontana said of Williams, [...] "He read the script, responded instantly and said, 'When do you want me there?'. He {{could not have been more}} prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone, and he worked his tail off. That whole experience was a joy." [...] Williams himself said of the show, [...] "Visually, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> different from anything else on television." [...] Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. Williams' scenes were filmed over three days, and the actors found the part emotionally draining. Fontana said, [...] " [...] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us.

Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up.

[...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E

Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream.

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour."

500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do we have to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> implausible and just an image that Black folks don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane!

[...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E

[...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality.

At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows.

[...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> heavy.
