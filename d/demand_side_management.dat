25|$|Fletcher {{argued that}} the PC party did not run on {{creating}} a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond what the government had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation {{at the cost of}} billions of dollars, with no where to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the <b>demand</b> <b>side</b> <b>management</b> of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine with the facts that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro fiscal position to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro {{has no choice but to}} raise rates. This in itself will reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.|$|E
500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or <b>demand</b> <b>side</b> <b>management.</b> Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases.

2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the supply of {{electricity}} consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as <b>demand</b> <b>side</b> <b>management</b> (DSM). [...] For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, {{in the same way that}} telephone companies do with individual customers. [...] Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time. [...] In an attempt to save more money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. <b>Demand</b> <b>side</b> <b>management</b> can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers. In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters, air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation, weatherstripping, and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating. Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like boilers, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS).|$|E

40|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>Side</b> Response <b>management</b> {{encourages}} elec- tricity demand reduction {{during peak}} hours. One avenue for achieving this is through <b>Demand</b> <b>Side</b> Units (DSUs). These are large electricity consumers {{who can afford}} to reduce their demand on the electricity grid when required. Issues with DSUs revolve around verification that the correct demand reduction takes place, with limited monitoring capabilities from the electrical grid operator Eir- Grid. This issue is studied here with the current methods thoroughly analysed and new methods proposed. In this report six different forecasting methods are presented, and their accuracy is compared using two different error metrics. Due to inherent stochasticity in demand it is found that there is no one fore- casting method which is unequivocally best, but the ‘Keep it simple’ weekly and the temperature dependent models are identified as the most promising models to pursue. Initial investigations suggest that a ‘proxy day’ mechanism may be preferable to the current method of verifying that the correct demand reduction takes place...|$|R
