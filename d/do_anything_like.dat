500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{admired the}} concerto {{and it may}} have {{influenced}} his Piano Concerto No. 3, also in C minor. After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked to a colleague that [...] "e shall never be able to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Johannes Brahms also admired the concerto, encouraging Clara Schumann to play it, and wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. Brahms referred to the work as a [...] "masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{tracks for}} her greatest hits compilation, Greatest Hits – Chapter One, Clarkson began discussing with her record label RCA Records about plans for her sixth studio album being a Christmas release in late 2012, {{during which she}} also began to write original Christmas material. Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with, was approached by Clarkson to produce the album; and together, they co-wrote the tracks [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] and [...] "4 Carats". [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] was produced by Kurstin, who also played most of the instruments, including a mellotron and a Chamberlin, to evoke a Phil Spector's Wall of Sound treatment—a sound that Billboard and HitFix noticed upon hearing the song. He also had Clarkson provide all the voices in it, including all its backing vocals. She recalled the experience as new, stating, [...] "I've never had to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E
5000|$|Musically, {{the album}} was notable for the 11 minute track [...] "Circle" [...] {{comprising}} several movements, [...] "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth" [...] that, according to Harper, was [...] "totally unlike anything anyone else was doing. The Beatles weren’t <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that at the time. The Stones weren’t <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, either. No-one was" ...|$|R

2500|$|It's {{this world}} where the Marvel heroines are leaders in their own civilization. I really didn't {{want to have some}} kind of validating reason... So I didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "all the men {{disappeared}} years ago" [...] or [...] "ever since all the menfolk were killed in that war" [...] or something like that. There are men—there are heroes there. You'll see familiar faces and favorites, but the heroines are in charge, by majority. It's just this is how their world evolved. They were competent. They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} for Yorkshire, he {{struggled}} for form and was {{left out of}} the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka. In the County Championship he managed 25wickets at an average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for scuffing the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined £750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining [...] "It's not the way I want to play my game. I don't {{want to be seen as}} a cheat, or a pitch-damager.... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely would never <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it again. It was just a random, stupid act." [...] Despite a trying year, Shahzad was selected in the England Performance Programme held over the English off-season.|$|E
2500|$|The Gators faced {{off against}} the Bulldogs {{in the annual}} rivalry taking place in Jacksonville, Florida. [...] Georgia led the series {{entering}} the game 45-38-2. [...] Florida had won 15 of the last 18 meetings {{dating back to the}} 1990 season, which was Steve Spurrier's first season as head coach. [...] Urban Meyer was 2-1 against Georgia before the game with his only loss coming the previous year in a 42-30 win over the Gators. [...] In that win, Knowshon Moreno's one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter sparked a [...] by the entire Bulldogs team in the end zone, known as the [...] "Gator Stomp." [...] Georgia head coach Mark Richt defended his actions in having his team intentionally celebrate. [...] He was quoted as saying [...] "I wanted to make sure we left this game with our hearts on the field." [...] He was later quoted in summer media presses: [...] "In hindsight, I shouldn't have done it. I won't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that again. It could have easily turned into a big, stupid brawl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foley said in {{his first}} book that his wife cried during a post-match phone {{conversation}} between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling. He also said that after the match, Vince McMahon thanked him for all he had done for the company, but made Foley promise to [...] "never <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that again." [...] He also made mention {{in the book of}} a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Petit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to The Undertaker and asked, [...] "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied, [...] "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm. On the 2011 DVD release OMG! - The Top 50 Incidents in WWE History, the match was ranked at number one.|$|E
2500|$|In today's society, {{abortion}} {{has become}} a common practice, defended by deceptive arguments. Latter-day prophets have denounced abortion, referring to the Lord's declaration, [...] "Thou shalt not ... kill, nor <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> unto it" [...] (Doctrine & Covenants Section 59, Verse 6). Their counsel on the matter is clear: Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints must not submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for an abortion. Church members who encourage an abortion in any way {{may be subject to}} Church discipline .... Church leaders have said that some exceptional circumstances may justify an abortion, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent medical authority to be in serious jeopardy, or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. But even these circumstances do not automatically justify an abortion. Those who face such circumstances should consider abortion only after consulting with their local Church leaders and receiving a confirmation through earnest prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haggard's {{immediate}} response was denial. He told a Denver television station, [...] "I {{did not have}} a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver... I am steady with my wife. I'm faithful to my wife." [...] Haggard also said, [...] "I have never done drugsever. Not even in high school. I didn't smoke pot. I didn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that. I'm not a drug man. We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't do that kind of thing." [...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Myra," [...] Nat agreed. [...] "We don't {{want to have}} {{to carry}} both you and your mother, and though you have walked a good deal more than most of the girls of your own class you have never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
