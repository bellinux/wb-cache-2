The film is about two teenage girls living in suburbia who accidentally exchange cell phones with a famous teen musician.

500|$|A {{supporter}} of the LGBT movement, Nelson published in 2006 through iTunes a version of Ned Sublette's [...] "Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other", that met instant success. During an interview with Texas Monthly in 2013, regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and Same-sex marriage in the United States, Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the Civil Rights Movement, stating: [...] "We'll {{look back and say}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> that we ever even argued about this". He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LBGT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became viral instantly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.|$|E
500|$|Webber {{said he was}} {{at fault}} for causing the {{accident}} between himself and Rosberg on lap nineteen; [...] "I thought I'd managed to catch it but I lost the car and made contact with the wall. Then Nico hit me, which wrecked his race as well. It was my mistake and it wasn't my day." [...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't hit the brakes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> to roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jayson Rodriguez for MTV News, da Don explained how he conceptualized the song, saying [...] "I came from a Jerry Bruckheimer meeting after seeing the movie, and they were telling us all the music they needed for all the scenes and the characters. So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself were in the room, it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Sebastian Vettel described the race {{as one of}} his best ever, calling it [...] "a great day; we had a really great weekend". He also revealed that his drink bottle had failed halfway into the race, causing him to become thirsty as drivers lose two to three litres in sweat during the Singapore race. Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that an undercut, overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible {{had it not been for}} the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it was a good one at least. I hope it was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> obviously [...]" [...] The intruder was later revealed to be 27-year-old British citizen Yogvitam Pravin Dhokia. He appeared in court on the Tuesday following the race and was offered a bail of , which he was unable to pay. He was later sentenced to serve six weeks in jail.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E

2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite of this, Young {{considered}} ending his career. In an article published by NFL.com Young {{was quoted as saying}} he thought about retiring from professional football after his first season stating [...] "I really thought long and hard about it. There was so much going on with my family. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> being an NFL quarterback. It wasn't fun anymore. All of the fun was out of it. All of the excitement was gone. All I was doing was worrying about things." [...] However, Young would later recant this stating he never considered quitting football and his remarks were blown out of proportion.|$|E

60|$|He came {{to himself}} a moment afterwards, {{seated in a}} border of small rose-bushes. His hands and knees were cut and bleeding, for the wall had been {{protected}} against such an escalade by a liberal provision of old bottles; and he was conscious of a general dislocation and a painful swimming in the head. Facing him across the garden, which was in admirable order, and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume, he beheld {{the back of a}} house. It was of considerable extent, and plainly habitable; but, in odd contrast to the grounds, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy,</b> ill-kept, and of a mean appearance. On all other sides the circuit of the garden wall appeared unbroken.|$|E

2500|$|Just as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crazy</b> to squander in a {{few decades}} much of the rich {{biological}} diversity that has evolved over billions of years, so <b>is</b> <b>it</b> equally <b>crazy</b> to permit the disappearance of much of human cultural diversity, which has evolved in a somewhat analogous way over many {{tens of thousands of}} years… The erosion of local cultural patterns around the world is not, however, entirely or even principally the result of contact with the universalizing effect of scientific enlightenment. Popular culture is in most cases far more effective at erasing distinctions between one place or society and another. Blue jeans, fast food, rock music, and American television serials have been sweeping the world for years. (1994: 338-343) ...|$|R

6000|$|Apparently Fillmore {{is still}} full of big schemes, for he talked airily about buying all sorts of English plays. He has come over, as I suppose you know, to arrange about putting on [...] "The Primrose Way" [...] over here. He is staying at the Savoy, and they took me off there to lunch, {{whooping}} joyfully as over a strayed lamb. It {{was the worst thing}} that could possibly have happened to me. Fillmore talked Broadway without a pause, till by the time he had worked his way past the French pastry and was lolling back, breathing a little stertorously, waiting for the coffee and liqueurs, he had got me so homesick that, if it hadn't been that I didn't want to make a public exhibition of myself, I should have broken down and howled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> of me ever to go near the Savoy. Of course, it's simply an annex to Broadway. There were Americans at every table as far as the eye could reach. I might just as well have been at the Astor.|$|E

An' to {{preserve}} that life is each man's first an' closest thought. Where would any man be on this border without guns? Where, especially, would Lassiter be? Well, I'd be under the sage with thousands of other men now livin' an' sure better men than me. Gun-packin' in the West since the Civil War has growed {{into a kind of}} moral law. An' out here on this border it's the difference between a man an' somethin' not a man. Look what your takin' Venters's guns from him all but made him! Why, your churchmen carry guns. Tull has killed a man an' drawed on others. Your Bishop has shot a half dozen men, an' it wasn't through prayers of his that they recovered. An' to-day he'd have shot me if he'd been quick enough on the draw. Could I walk or ride down into Cottonwoods without my guns?
