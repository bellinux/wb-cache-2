40|$|This review gives a very {{personal}} view {{of some of the}} work that has led up to the present state of knowledge about synapses and ion channels. It would take a whole book to do justice to this topic, and we can only apologise in advance for failing to mention by name {{most of the people who}} have played an important part. Many of the new ideas that are proclaimed daily are actually quite old, and it is perhaps appropriate to remind the present generation of neuroscientists of how current views have evolved. A surprising number of them can be found in the prescient work of Bernard Katz and his colleagues at University College London, to whom this article is a tribute. Katz made fundamental contributions to both presynaptic (transmitter release) and postsynaptic (ion channel) aspects of synaptic transmission. We shall concentrate on the latter, and Erwin Neher will discuss presynaptic events in the next review. We may, I think, without too much rashness, assume that there is some substance or substances in the nerve endings or [salivary] gland cells with which both atropine and pilocarpine are capable of forming compounds. On this assumption, then, the atropine or pilocarpine compounds are formed according to some law of which their relative mass and chemical affinity for the substance are factors. The first estimate of the time course of transmitter action was derived from measurements of the rise and decay time course of the extracellularly recorded endplate potential and from double pulse experiments (Eccles et al. 1941). It was correctly inferred that the permeability change following a nerve impulse lasted only a few milliseconds. Almost half a century passed after Hills astonishing paper was published before the next critical development took place. This development was the recognition that the binding of an agonist to a receptor, and the subsequent activation of the receptor, had to be treated as two separate steps if any sense were to be made of the experimental results (Stephenson 1956; Castillo and Katz 1957). Although this sounds like a small extension of what had already been done, it took a long time to come, and it proved extraordinarily fruitful (as discussed below). Indeed, the lessons of this development are still not universally appreciated. In the early 1970 s, the advent of noise analysis (Katz and Miledi 1970; Katz and Miledi 1971; Katz and Miledi 1972) allowed the first (indirect) inferences about the properties of single ion channels. In the 1970 paper, Katz and Miledi showed fluctuations of the response to acetylcholine that were so obvious that one wondered why nobody had noticed them before. Katz and Miledi suggested, correctly, that the fluctuations were caused by the random opening and shutting of individual ion channels, and used the amplitude of the fluctuations to estimate that the elementary depolarisation elicited by ACh was about 0. 3 &# 956;V in amplitude. For the first time, there was a <b>firm</b> <b>estimate</b> of the number of channels opened by a single quantum of ACh. Katz and Miledi 1971; Katz and Miledi 1972 went on to exploit the temporal characteristics of the noise to estimate the duration of elementary events, as well as their amplitude. By plotting the distribution of frequencies in the fluctuations as a power spectrum, they were able to conclude, for example, that the channel that appeared after denervation had a longer mean open time than the adult channel, and that carbachol produced briefer openings than ACh. They were also able to estimate the single channel conductance as being of the order of 100 pS, within a factor of 3 of the value subsequently found by single channel channel measurements. This was far bigger than some previous biochemical estimates had suggested, and it finally settled the long-running discussion about whether the receptor was a pore or a carrier. The development of noise analysis had made it natural to think in terms of single ion channels, which had been observed in artificial bilayers, but in the early 1970 s nobody had seen one in a biological membrane. There was quite a large range of estimates for the size of the current that a single channel might pass and no knowledge of the shape of the elementary current event. It was these problems that guided the quest to measure single channel currents directly. These questions were frequently discussed in Katzs Department at University College London, and they seemed to me (B. S.) to be central questions in synaptic physiology. Although estimates of channel conductance from noise analysis turned out to be reasonably accurate, there were many other estimates (e. g., from biochemical measurements) that were wildly inaccurate. When they met again in Göttingen, Erwin Neher (who was recording single channels from doped bilayers) and B. S. decided to attempt measurements of elementary synaptic currents with patch pipettes. Earlier work with noise analysis had suggested that the elementary events in chronically denervated muscle fibres were somewhat smaller and had a severalfold longer duration than those in the subsynaptic membrane (Katz and Miledi 1971; Neher and Sakmann 1976 a). It was therefore decided that this was a suitable preparation for an attempt to see single channels. Restriction of the measurement to a small patch of membrane 1  2 &# 956;m in diameter, with a seal resistance of about 100 M&# 937;, was sufficient to reduce the background noise to less than 1 pA at the necessary bandwidth. One of our very first attempts in Göttingen in spring 1975 showed square pulse-like events in patch pipette recordings from denervated frog muscle and assured us that we were on the right path. The results were published in the following year (Neher and Sakmann 1976 b). The next few years were spent in controlling possible artefacts, developing new and more convenient preparations, and increasing the seal resistance to several G&# 937;, making patches mechanically stable. These improvements allowed measurements at a higher time resolution, and in conditions where it was possible to control both voltage and the ion concentrations on both faces of the membrane (Hamill et al. 1981). The significance of this work on ion channels extended far beyond the description of the acetylcholine receptor; it also impinged on a much older pharmacological problem. Stephenson 1956 had pointed out the very important fact that the action of an agonist could not be described by an affinity constant alone. In addition, some measure of the ability of the agonist to activate the receptor (i. e., in our case, to open the channel) was essential too (he termed the latter the efficacy of the agonist). This postulate was, very rightly, enormously influential (though widely misunderstood, as may be seen by the inaccurate accounts that are found in most textbooks to this day). Stephenson had formulated his theory in a black box manner, but unfortunately it turned out subsequently that the box was too black, and it was not possible to measure the postulated quantities without knowing something about mechanism (Colquhoun 1987). This stood in strong contrast to Schilds method for estimating the equilibrium constant for an antagonist, which is remarkably independent of the contents of the black box. Just after Stephensons paper, del Castillo and Katz 1957, quite independently, addressed essentially the same problem. They, however, took the opposite approach, and discussed the problem in terms of a simple but specific mechanism, an agonist-binding step followed by a conformation change step. Their motive was very similar to Stephensons, which was to explain the action of partial agonists. In their mechanism, the equilibrium constant for the second step provided a physical embodiment of Stephensons efficacy. The analysis of single channels had allowed efficacy to be defined in a concrete way, and to be measured. Although the ideas of Stephenson and Katz are now quite old, they have assumed a new importance in the age of molecular biology. It is now commonplace for mutations to be made in a receptor protein with the aim of locating the position of the agonist binding site. But these old ideas make it obvious that the interpretation of such experiments may be far from obvious. Clearly the EC 50 for the agonist (often, but unhelpfully, referred to as apparent affinity) is affected by both steps in the reaction, the initial binding step and the conformation change step. Even now it is not uncommon to read that the properties of the binding site can be inferred by doing a ligand-binding experiment, whereas a glance at the simple model of del Castillo and Katz 1957 shows that this is obviously not true (for any ligand that causes a conformation change) : the affinity for agonist as measured in a radioligand-binding experiment also depends on both steps in the mechanism. There is, of course, no reason to think that the mutated amino acid is in the binding site unless it is the first (binding) step that is affected rather than the second, and it is not at all easy to obtain evidence that this is the case. This problem, often referred to in the ion channel context as the bindinggating problem, has been widely ignored, and it will be very interesting to see, when full structures become available, just how many mutation experiments have led to incorrect conclusions as a result. It will be equally interesting to see how much sense can be made of the relationship between protein structure and mechanism when the analysis is done properly. A more sophisticated version of the analysis used by Colquhoun and Sakmann has been used by Sine and Auerbach to interpret mutations of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that cause myasthenic syndromes (e. g.,Sine et al. 1995). Their analysis provides a good illustration of the fact that the importance of considering mechanism extends far beyond an esoteric interest in kineticsindeed, it is critically important for the sort of problems that recombinant DNA methods are now being used so widely to elucidate. By the mid 1980 s, it had become obvious that molecular biology was going to become enormously important in investigation of the structure and mechanism of ion channels. Shosaku Numas laboratory in rapid succession cloned the genes of the ACh channel (seeNuma 1989), and a rather intense and enjoyable collaboration began to develop between physiology and molecular biology. Green, Heinemann, and Guisella review this enormous field elsewhere in this issue of Neuron. The earliest studies on the acetylcholine receptor channel concentrated on structure and ion permeation. For example, it had been demonstrated that the receptor that is present in the membrane of denervated muscle fibres is different from that in normal adult endplate (Katz and Miledi 1971). This type of receptor is also present in the endplate of neonatal muscles and is replaced by the adult receptor during postnatal development (Sakmann and Brenner 1978; Fischbach and Schuetze 1980). An early success for molecular biology was the demonstration that the difference between them resulted from replacement of the foetal &# 947; subunit by the adult &# 949; subunit, which was coded by a different gene (Mishina et al. 1986). A new line of research at the neuromuscular junction was triggered by the discovery that certain human diseases, the congenital myasthenic syndromes (seeVincent et al. 1997), are caused by mutations in the muscle nicotinic receptor. Some sophisticated analysis has been done on such mutants (e. g.,Sine et al. 1995), and they have had a good deal of success in distinguishing between mutations that affect binding and those that affect gating. For every other sort of channel, apart from the muscle endplate, there is not enough knowledge of the kinetic mechanism for firm conclusions to be drawn, though this does not usually prevent them from being drawn anyway, and some of the conclusions will, no doubt, turn out to be right. One of the shocks of molecular biology was the revelation that many receptors are far more complex than had previously been assumed. The muscle nicotinic receptor is the simplest, but there are 11 different subunits for neuronal nicotinic receptors, at least 14 for the GABAA channel, and 8 for the non-NMDA (AMPA and kainate) channels, though glycine and NMDA channels seem to be a bit simpler. On top of this, there are many more variants that result from alternative splicing and RNA editing. The number of possible subunit combinations is, for many receptors, astronomical. It immediately became a major problem to discover (1) which subunits assemble together to form native receptors, and (2) whether the wide diversity of structures is useful to the organism. Progress has been slow on these two central problems. In many cases, we do not know the native composition with any accuracy, and even when we have a good idea about that, we often do not know whether that particular composition is essential for function or whether another would do just as well. In some cases, there are receptors present whose function is not yet known at all (seeSivilotti and Colquhoun 1995). The problem of subtype specificity is, of course, not limited to ion channels. Similar questions have arisen about almost every protein that has been cloned. The answers are not only of intellectual interest, but they are also of vital importance for therapeutics. If a particular subtype has a well-defined function, then a drug that is selective for that subtype may be useful. This approach has been exploited successfully in the periphery (e. g., selective blockers for adrenoreceptor subtypes or histamine receptor subtypes), but has yet to come to fruition in the brain. The development of methods to record from cells expressing recombinant receptors, and to record from brain slices, triggered a new industry of investigations into synapses and ion channels. Many of these investigations basically followed the pattern that was developed at the neuromuscular junction. The aims have been to explain the time course of synaptic currents in terms of the underlying channel events and to investigate the function of the channels by making mutations. One aspect that is quite different from anything that was done at the neuromuscular junction has been the investigation of the very complex behaviour of two or more connected neurons. The ability to observe one (macro) molecule doing its business and the ability to change any chosen amino acid in that molecule are indeed exciting. But we are faced with thousands of possible channels and a million and one potential regulators of them. The observation of phenomena has far outstripped the knowledge of which of them are actually important for the animal. This is, perhaps, the biggest challenge for the future. The main hope for addressing the central question of the physiological role of receptors, and of their subtypes, has for some time been the use of genetically manipulated animals. The outcome of much effort has, up to now, been somewhat disappointing. In many cases the animal dies, so it is concluded that the gene in question is important (but we still do not know for what). In many more cases the effects of knockout are quite small (in which case the conclusion is often the samethe gene must be important because mechanisms must exist to compensate for its loss). Let us hope that switchable, and region-specific, knock-in of mutant receptors will be more informative...|$|E
