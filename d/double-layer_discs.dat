50|$|Blu-ray Disc Recordable (or BD-R) {{refers to}} two direct to disc optical disc {{recording}} technologies {{that can be}} recorded on to an optical disc with an optical disc recorder. BD-R discs can be written to once, whereas BD-RE (Blu-ray Disc Recordable Erasable) can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. Disc capacities are 25 GB for single-layer discs, 50 GB for <b>double-layer</b> <b>discs,</b> 100 GB for triple-layer, and 128 GB for quadruple-layer (in BD-R only).|$|E
50|$|The Wii Optical Disc (RVL-006) is the {{physical}} game medium for the Wii, created by Panasonic. Nintendo extended their proprietary technology {{to use a}} full size 12 cm, 4.7/8.54 GB DVD-based disc, enabling it to have {{the benefits of the}} Nintendo GameCube Game Disc, while having the standard capacity of a double-layer DVD-ROM. Although the Wii can use <b>double-layer</b> <b>discs,</b> all titles were single-layer prior to the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. With the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Nintendo admitted that some Wii systems may have trouble reading dual-layer discs due to a dirty laser lens. Nintendo repaired systems with dual-layer problems, and later released a disc cleaning kit for users to purchase.|$|E
50|$|Déjà Vrooom is a live DVD by {{the band}} King Crimson, {{released}} in 1999 as a double-sided disc and reissued in 2007 as a <b>double-layer</b> <b>disc.</b> It was recorded at Nakano Sun Plaza, Nakano, Tokyo, Japan, 5-6 October 1995. Video recordings from these performances were first released as the Japanese LaserDisc Live in Japan, in 1996, and the audio soundtrack {{was released on}} CD as The Collectible King Crimson Volume 5.|$|R
50|$|DVD-R DL: a {{derivative}} of DVD-R that uses <b>double-layer</b> recordable <b>discs</b> to store up to 8.5 GB of data.|$|R
50|$|The film had {{a special}} limited box set edition, that {{provided}} the DVD of the film, a <b>double-layered</b> Blu-Ray <b>Disc</b> and a model of one of Senna's racing cars.|$|R
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the film were released, one in cinemas, DVD, Netflix, iTunes, and Blu-ray Disc. The other is only available in the United Kingdom in <b>double-layered</b> Blu-ray <b>Disc,</b> extending {{the length of the}} film with more interviews and insider information.|$|R
5000|$|Before the Dreamcast was released, Sega [...] "confirmed that Dreamcast {{owners will}} one day be able to upgrade the GD-ROM drive to DVD," [...] as {{information}} indicated Sony's anticipated successor to the PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, would use the DVD format with its much larger capacity 4.7 GB single-layered up to 8.5 GB <b>double-layered</b> <b>discs</b> compared to the 1.2 GB capacity of the GD-ROM. Despite displaying a Dreamcast DVD display unit at E3 2000, the plans for a DVD add-on or fully separate unit never materialized during the significantly shorter production run of the Dreamcast. The GD-ROM format {{is considered one of the}} causes that led to the failure of the Dreamcast, since the PlayStation 2 initially sold well for providing DVD video playback at much lower cost than dedicated DVD players of the time, even though the PlayStation 2 launch games were lacking compared to the Dreamcast's. Sony was able to provide a larger install base due to DVD, despite the costs being higher to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in optical data storage {{have led to}} the development of a five-dimensional device that could hold up to 2, 000 times more data than a conventional DVD. Bit-by-bit optical data storage uses photons to introduce a localized physical or chemical property change such as photoinduced fluorescence or reflectance modulation as information storing processes. When an optical disc is scanned, pre-stored information can be retrieved back by detecting the intensity variation of the reading beam. Researchers have pursued further research to explore the feasibility of three-dimensional (3 -D) optical data storage, such as double-layer DVDs and <b>double-layer</b> Blu-ray <b>discs.</b> They have also introduced the 2 P excitation technique into 3 -D optical data storage with two orthogonal beams intersecting inside the focuses of two objectives. Since 2 P absorption is a highly nonlinear process, a high-power pulsed laser is generally required to facilitate the 2 P process. The urgent demand for more capacity compels the development of ultra-high-density storage devices...|$|R
