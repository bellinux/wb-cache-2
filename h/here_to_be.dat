Raj's arrest ignited violence by his supporters in {{large parts of the}} city forcing it to shut down. Irate supporters went on the rampage torching public transport and telling office goers to return home. Many shops and commercial establishments, especially those run or managed by non-Maharashtrians, chose not to open at all to avoid trouble. Raj, whose MNS workers Sunday attacked non-Maharashtrians appearing for the railway board examination, was brought from Ratnagiri, about 250km from <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced at the Bandra court, where he was summoned for.|$|E

25|$|During the Mexican War of Independence, {{the city}} was taken by Miguel Serrano and Vicente Beristain de Souza in 1812, which caused the mines <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{abandoned}} by owners loyal to Spain. The war left the Pachuca area {{in a state of}} chaos, both politically and economically. The third Count of Regla brought the first Cornish miners and technology around 1824. The Cornish took over mines abandoned by the Spanish, bringing 1,500 tones of more modern equipment from Cornwall. Cornish companies eventually dominated mining here until 1848, when the Mexican American War forced them to sell out to a Mexican company by the name of Mackintosh, Escondón, Beistegui and John Rule. Mining operations resumed in 1850, especially in the Rosario mine.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, Štúr wrote {{a letter}} to Czech {{historian}} František Palacký, in which he stated that the Czech language used by the Protestants in Upper Hungary had become incomprehensible for ordinary Slovaks, and proposed the creation of a unified Czechoslovak language, provided that the Czechs would be willing to use some Slovak words – just like Slovaks would officially accept some Czech words. But the Czechs were unwilling to accept this, and so Štúr and his friends decided to introduce a completely new Slovak language standard instead. On 24 April 1836, a trip to Devín Castle (Dévény, now part of Bratislava) by the members of the Slovak national movement took place, led by Štúr as the vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society. The beginning of his group's extensive efforts on behalf of national awareness are linked to this visit to the ruins of Devín Castle, woven together with legends and reminders of Great Moravia. The members of the Czech-Slav Society swore <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true to the national cause, deciding to travel around Upper Hungary to drum up support for their ideas. At the castle, they also adopted additional Slavic names (e.g., Jozef Hurban became Jozef Miloslav Hurban, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Kwanusila the Thunderbird, is an {{authentic}} Kwagu'ł totem pole, carved in Red Cedar by Tony Hunt of Fort Rupert, British Columbia. The crests carved upon the totem pole represent Kwanusila the Thunderbird, a whale {{with a man}} on its back, and a sea monster. Many people do not realize that totem poles were only regionally used by First Nations along the coastal areas of British Columbia. Kwanusila is an exact replica of the original Kraft Lincoln Park totem pole, which was donated to the City of Chicago by James L. Kraft on June 20, 1929, and which stood on the spot until October 9, 1985. It was discovered some years before the pole was moved, that a pole of this type {{did not exist in}} the types at the Provincial British Columbia Museum located in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Arrangements were made for a duplicate of the Chicago original to be made by the same Amerindian tribe that made the original. A request was made and approved by the Chicago Park District for the original totem pole which existed <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented back to British Columbia. Kwanusila is dedicated to the school children of Chicago, and was presented to the City of Chicago by Kraft, Inc. on May 21, 1986.|$|E

Immediately afterwards guards burst into the room and inject Mulder with a syringe. When Mulder awakens he is in a large room bound with chicken wire along with many other prisoners.

500|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2003 remastered {{version of the}} album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he {{constantly}} had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song [...] "What Goes On" [...] {{in the back of}} his mind. He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} Sonic 3 had innovated too little from {{previous}} Sonic games. Humphreys of Hyper saw only [...] "a few new features" [...] while Sega Power {{thought it was}} [...] "not all that different" [...] and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that [...] "there's {{not a lot of}} new elements <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brutally frank". Frank Provo of GameSpot stated that the game's most significant addition was its save system. However, he and Electronic Gaming Monthly also both enjoyed the new power-ups. Many aspects of the game's level design were praised; Electronic Gaming Monthly and Sega Power enjoyed the game's expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty. Mean Machines agreed, describing the game as [...] "a rollercoater ride from start to finish" [...] and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as [...] "probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history". Humphreys and Mean Machines felt that the game was too short, but they and Sega Magazine felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the title's replay value. On the other hand, Whitehead said that the stages' large sizes would keep players sufficiently engrossed. Sega Magazine also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.|$|E
500|$|Along with Blue Lines, Maxinquaye {{was hailed}} by journalists as the pivotal release {{in what they}} were calling [...] "trip hop" [...] music; Jon Pareles, the chief critic at The New York Times, called it the genre's [...] "first album-length masterpiece". Tricky disliked the term, saying [...] "I was {{supposed}} to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that [...] "there's too much <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sequestered to any genre, let alone that one... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is so much better than that." [...] In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye [...] "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was dubbed [...] "the British postmodern album of the 90s" [...] by Jason Draper of Record Collector and [...] "a visionary post-rock statement" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remained [...] "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" [...] because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of [...] "noise and experimental music". In The Village Voice, Christgau believed its significance lied in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: ...|$|E

Mrs Fletcher said: [...] "I know he is ill and I think he should be returned to a prison in Libya so his family can visit him.
