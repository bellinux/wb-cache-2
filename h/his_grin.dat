25|$|Chapter Six â€“ Pig and Pepper: A Fish-Footman has an {{invitation}} for the Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a Frog-Footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's Cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and to her surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears, but <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> remains behind to float on its own in the air, prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.|$|E
6000|$|... "You... {{you have}} no fear, Nicholas...." [...] He did not add of what. But the servant understood, and <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> grew broader still.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yis, dat's de word," [...] {{said the}} negro, {{increasing}} <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> {{for a moment}} and then collapsing into sudden solemnity; [...] "we nebber fights 'cep' in self-defence--oh no--nebber!" ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, and pausing for {{an instant}} {{at the door to}} turn <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> face towards <b>his</b> friend, he departed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Coward clown!" [...] burst forth Gaston at once. [...] "Would that I {{could send}} all <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> teeth down the false throat of him!" ...|$|R
60|$|The chief's assumed dignity {{vanished}} at this. With that childlike hilarity {{peculiar to}} the Eskimo race, he laughed outright, and then, seizing the cap from Merkut's head, put it above {{his own to}} the amusement of <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> followers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Dad," [...] he said, [...] "tonight's the night! Tonight's some night, Dad.--You {{can sleep}} any time--" [...] <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> widened--"but there aren't many nights to sit here--like this--Eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|Boardman was one {{of those}} who seldom laugh; but <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> {{expressed}} all the malicious enjoyment he felt. He said nothing in the impressive silence which Mavering let follow at this point.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} afraid to speak my mind," [...] went on Smith. Here he lost <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> and his coarse mouth grew hard. [...] "Gulden {{will have to be}} killed if we're goin' to last!" ...|$|E
60|$|The individual, who was {{in perfect}} good-humour, {{did not appear to}} bear one word which Policeman X uttered, but nodded and waggled <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> head at Strong, until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And take care,' {{returned}} his patron, bending forward to advance <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> face {{closer to the}} boy's, and pat {{him on the shoulder}} with the handle of his whip: 'take care you talk about affairs of mine to nobody but me.' ...|$|R
60|$|His thin arms swung aimlessly, and his roaring {{voice had}} no more heart in it than the blare of a tin horn. His eyes wandered from face to face {{in the circle of}} <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> companions who egged him on.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a way, he did not," [...] said Marston. [...] "He was a dirty, ragged old impostor--and yet I don't know. Perhaps it was <b>his</b> <b>grin,</b> {{but you got}} a {{hint that}} he was a bigger man than he looked. There was {{something}} about him----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{caught up}} with me on the road home, and grinned as cheerfully as usual. But <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> could never deceive me again. I had seen the REAL Jonas. I {{wondered}} if he could ever see the REAL PHIL--whom NOBODY, not even you, Anne, has ever seen yet.|$|E
60|$|Spennie {{hesitated for}} an instant when he saw {{who was in the}} room. He was not over-anxious for a tete-a-tete with Molly's father just then. But, re-fleeting that, after all, he was not to blame for any {{disappointment}} that might be troubling the other, he switched on <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> again, and walked in.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean, sir? I am {{young enough}} for you, sir. Just {{let me get}} ahold o' you, sir, and I'll show you, you young rascal! you dem jackanapes!" [...] he ended, almost shrieking with rage, as he shook his fist {{in the face of}} <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> tormentors.|$|R
60|$|Peter withdrew with <b>his</b> stereotyped <b>grin</b> to make <b>his</b> preparations.|$|R
60|$|As for Spennie, the {{brilliance}} of <b>his</b> happy <b>grin</b> dazzled all beholders.|$|R
6000|$|The {{official}} {{behind the}} desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to his perfunctory question, [...] "Sign off and on again?" [...] my Captain answered, [...] "No! Signing off for good." [...] And then <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> vanished in sudden solemnity. He {{did not look at}} me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful expression, {{as if they had been}} my passports for Hades.|$|E
60|$|Rasmunsen {{grinned and}} {{tightened}} his aching {{grip on the}} sweep. Scores of times had the send of the sea caught the big square stern of the Alma and thrown her off from dead before it till the after leach of the spritsail fluttered hollowly, and each time, and only with all his strength, had he forced her back. <b>His</b> <b>grin</b> by then had become fixed, and it disturbed the correspondents to look at him.|$|E
6000|$|Yet when dear Carson had jauntily departed, {{leaving the}} room still loud with the smack of <b>his</b> <b>grin,</b> Istra {{seemed to have}} {{forgotten}} that Mr. Wrenn was alive. She was scowling at {{a book on the}} bed as though it had said things to her. So he sat quiet and crushed the magazine covers more closely till the silence choked him, and he dared, [...] "Mr. Carson is an awful well-educated man." ...|$|E
60|$|Thou silly thing, off to thy daisies go. Mine was not {{news for}} child to know, And Death--no ears hath. He hath supped where creep Eyeless worms in hush of sleep; Yet, when he smiles, the hand he draws Athwart <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> jaws-- Faintly the thin bones rattle, and--There, there; Hearken how my bells {{in the air}} Drive away care!...|$|R
60|$|The old steward, {{at work in}} <b>his</b> pantry, <b>grinned</b> at me when I {{mentioned}} the matter.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, on December 9, 1935. Walter Liggett {{was murdered}} by a Thompson submachine gun in a drive by {{shooting}} outside his apartment. His wife and children were in a car only inches away and witnessed his death. Weeping and saying {{that she would never}} forget <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> face, Mrs. Liggett picked Blumenfeld out of a police lineup as her husband's killer. Three other witnesses identified Blumenfeld as the shooter, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pulled it off," [...] said Chunk with Elysium in <b>his</b> <b>grin.</b> [...] "Rosy hit the fire-escape on {{time to a}} second, and we {{was under}} the wire at the Reverend's at 9.3O 1/4. She's up at the flat--she cooked eggs this mornin' in a blue kimono--Lord! how lucky I am! You must pace up some day, Ikey, and feed with us. I've got a job down near the bridge, and that's where I'm heading for now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy {{sat down}} and looked at Unc' Billy with {{twinkling}} eyes. <b>His</b> <b>grin</b> grew broader and became a chuckle. [...] "Unc' Billy," [...] said he, [...] "have you ever in your life combed your hair or brushed your coat?" [...] You know Unc' Billy usually looks as if every hair was trying to point {{in a different direction}} from every other hair, while Jimmy Skunk always appears as neat as if he spent half his time brushing and smoothing his handsome black and white coat.|$|E
6000|$|Perceiving her nervousness, Neill Ballard raised loud outcry over {{a mistake}} she made in {{returning}} change, and this so confused and angered {{her that her}} eyes misted with tears, and she blundered sadly with the next customer. His delight in her discomfiture, his words, <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> became unendurable, and in a flush of rage and despair she sprang {{to her feet and}} left them to make triumphant exit. [...] "I got her rattled!" [...] he roared, as he went out. [...] "She'll remember me." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Flyte {{family is}} widely found to symbolise the English nobility. One reads {{in the book}} that Brideshead has [...] "the {{atmosphere}} of a better age", and (referring to the deaths of Lady Marchmain's brothers in the Great War) [...] "these men must die to make a world for Hooper ... so that things might be safe for the travelling salesman, with his polygonal pince-nez, his fat, wet handshake, <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> dentures".|$|R
60|$|Here Babo, {{changing}} <b>his</b> previous <b>grin</b> of mere animal humor into {{an intelligent}} smile, not ungratefully eyed his master.|$|R
60|$|He gave <b>his</b> malevolent <b>grin</b> {{round the}} company, then went out. He did not {{reappear}} {{for the next}} scene.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure he has!' cried Gilbert. 'I am {{sure there}} was spite in <b>his</b> <b>grin</b> when he pulled out that horrid old parchment, with the lines a yard long, and read us out the abominable old crabbed writing, all about the houses, messuages, and tenements thereupon, {{and a lot of}} lawyer's jargon. I'm sure I thought it was left to Peter Pettilove himself. And when I came to {{understand}} it, one would have thought it took my father to be the worst enemy we had in the world, bent on cheating us!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt as if}} {{the whole}} man were a moral and {{physical}} humbug; his wonderful beauty of face, for aught I knew, might be removable like a mask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a wizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him save the wicked expression of <b>his</b> <b>grin.</b> The fantasy of his spectral character so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his strange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as himself.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{astonishing}} {{to himself}} {{to find his}} thoughts flowing out to her upon paper with the greatest ease. He was stricken with fear after he had mailed his letter, it was so bulky. He was appalled at {{the length of time}} which must pass before he might reasonably expect to hear from her. He counted the days, the hours that intervened. Her note came at last, and it made his blood leap as the clerk flung it out with a grin. [...] "She's blessed yeh this time!" [...] It was a red-headed clerk, and <b>his</b> <b>grin,</b> by reason of a quid of tobacco in his thin cheek, was particularly offensive. Bradley felt an impulse to call him out of his box and whip him.|$|E
60|$|His companion, a {{short man}} with a black {{mustache}} that almost made a circle about <b>his</b> mouth, <b>grinned</b> in silence.|$|R
40|$|A man {{stands on}} a chair beneath a large, {{spreading}} tree on which a tri-corn hat hangs from a limb, <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> face framed by a horse-collar, {{a woman and a}} man look on in the foreground, the man applauds, while a crowd of countrymen on the left, in the rear, encourage him with laughter and applause; with building on the right, in the background.

6000|$|... 'Here, {{here is a}} business!' soliloquized {{the young}} Duke. 'May Dacre! What a fool I have been! Shall I shoot myself through the head, or embrace her on the spot? Lord St. Jerome, too! He seems mightily pleased. And my family have been voting for two centuries to emancipate this fellow! Curse <b>his</b> <b>grinning</b> face! I am decidedly anti-Catholic. But then she is a Catholic! I will turn Papist. Ah! there is Lucy. I want a counsellor.' ...|$|R
