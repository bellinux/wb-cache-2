2500|$|A late entry by amateur {{architect}} William Thornton {{was submitted}} on January 31, 1793, to much praise for its [...] "Grandeur, Simplicity, and Beauty" [...] by Washington, along with praise from Thomas Jefferson. Thornton {{was inspired by}} the east front of the Louvre, as well as the Paris Pantheon for the center portion of the design. Thornton's design was officially approved in a letter dated April 5, 1793, from Washington, and Thornton served as the first Architect of the Capitol (and later first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office). In an effort to console Hallet, the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton's plans, <b>develop</b> <b>cost</b> estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton's design, which he saw as costly to build and problematic. In July 1793, Jefferson convened a five-member commission, bringing Hallet and Thornton together, along with James Hoban (winning architect of the [...] "President's Palace") to address problems with and revise Thornton's plan. Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan, which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton.

5000|$|In the Preface of [...] "Cost Accounting to Aid Production" [...] by Leon P. Alford, Alford {{summarized}} {{that many}} of the early efforts at industrial management were inspired by the needs of the accounting function of a manufacturing business. It was realized that a knowledge of costs was essential in meeting competition and in making sure that the business was stable. So, many of the attempts at bettering industrial organization and management sprang out of an effort to secure accurate costs. But generally speaking, professional accountants seem to have failed to fit their own work into the broad scheme of productive industry. And this has been permitted in spite of the teachings of many of the engineers who first entered the industrial field and who were compelled to <b>develop</b> <b>cost</b> accounting as one branch of their own work.|$|E

50|$|Project cost {{management}} is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge {{the importance of}} {{cost management}} and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management {{to be effective in}} managing project cost. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk cost, and learning curve theory.Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.Estimating costs is {{a very important part of}} project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive. Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tool and techniques can help you <b>develop</b> <b>cost</b> estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools.Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to cost. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to cost project management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organization to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.Several software products can assists with project cost management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of composites {{has been increasing}} dramatically in aerospace structures recently, for example, composites have contributed over 50 percent of the structure mass of large transport airplanes Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 XWB. However, the further usage has been restricted {{because of the high}} material and manufacturing costs. Hence, it is essential to utilize cost estimation tools for accurate cost estimation in the early design stages, and then efficient decisions and design optimizations could be made to reduce the cost of composite products. This research project aims to <b>develop</b> a <b>cost</b> model for aerospace carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites, which will help designers and cost engineers with the cost estimation for composites manufacturing in the early development stages. The main objectives of the research are to: (i) recognise the standard manufacturing stages and activities of CFRP components; (ii) identify the cost drivers of composites manufacturing; (iii) identify the cost estimation relationships; (iv) <b>develop</b> a <b>cost</b> model that can assist designers and engineers with manufacturing cost estimation for CFRP components; (v) validate the <b>developed</b> <b>cost</b> model through case studies and expert judgements. The process of model development was carried out through four main steps: firstly, conducting an integrated understanding of cost modelling for composites manufacturing; secondly, collecting data for cost modelling from industry and existing literature and databases; thirdly, <b>developing</b> the <b>cost</b> model with several function modules and databases; and finally, taking a validation of the developed model. The <b>developed</b> <b>cost</b> model consists of several modules: material selection, process planning, cost estimation, cost reporting and a user friendly interface. Moreover, the selection and planning modules are combined with databases including material and process. The developed model enables the user to estimate the manufacturing cost and process time of CFRP composites, and it can also help designers realize the impact of design changes on the manufacturing cost. The process planning can efficiently help estimators with manufacturing process understanding and accurate time estimation. Quality control activities are time consuming and investment sensitive in composites manufacturing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
