5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp,</b> increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
25|$|Syncaris pacifica is an {{endangered}} species of <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the family Atyidae that occurs only in a limited range within the northern San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA. Specifically, this species occurs only in 17 stream segments within Sonoma, Napa and Marin Counties. This species is often translucent to transparent, with both sexes capable of considerable coloration altering, as a sophisticated form of camouflage. This decapod {{is commonly known as}} California <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and is the only decapod shrimp in California that occurs in non-saline waters.|$|E

25|$|California <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp</b> prefer streams {{that have}} water flowing year round with predominately low {{gradient}} flows. In {{the summer months}} with little precipitation and surface runoff the flow rates can be very low with larger pools but they characteristically transport heavy runoff during the rainy winter season.|$|E
25|$|All Atyidae {{family members}} can be {{distinguished}} from other shrimp by their overall length {{as well as the}} extent length of their pincer-like claws and manifestation of terminal bristles (setae) at the tips of the first and second chelae. A short spine above the eye and the angled articulation of the second chelae with the carpus differentiate the California <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp</b> from other shrimp that occur California. A carapace length (reckoned from eye socket to tail-tip) of slightly more than five centimeters can be attained.|$|E
25|$|Syncaris pacifica is a ten-legged {{crustacean}} {{that employs}} a two-pronged approach to camouflage: {{it uses a}} technique of translucency coupled with strategically placed chromatophores, which occur internally {{as well as on}} the surface. As a result, the clustered color-producing cells combined with translucency masks the body outline and blends the organism to its subsurface environment. Consequently, an illusion is presented that S. pacifica are submerged, decaying vegetation. California <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp</b> move quite torpidly and are practically invisible among water column leaf and twig substrates, and among the slender, exposed, living roots of riparian vegetation along undercut stream banks.|$|E
40|$|Many <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Decapoda, Caridea) have amphidromous life histories, with {{extended}} planktonic larval {{development in}} the sea. Larvae either are hatched upstream to drift down to the sea or are carried and released there by females. After development, postlarvae (juveniles) must migrate back up to their adult freshwater habitat. An amphidromous life cycle thus involves long distance migrations between marine and fresh waters. Other <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimps</b> have abbreviated (or direct) larval development (ALD) with a completely freshwater life cycle and without such migrations. The question of which life history pattern (amphidromy versus ALD) is ancestral in <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimps</b> is {{discussed in terms of}} costs, benefits, and phylogeny. Competing hypotheses are presented to explain the unusual distribution of Macrobrachium ohione, an amphidromous shrimp with recently abundant populations located very far (> 1500 km) from the sea...|$|R

2500|$|As a {{slow moving}} species S. pacifica feeds on decomposing {{vegetation}} and other detritus, consuming minute diverse particles conveyed by currents to downstream pools. As the water slows, the particles are filtered by the fine network of exposed roots from trees, such as from willows and alders. The California <b>freshwater</b> <b>shrimp</b> merely brush {{up the food}} with tufts at the tips of their small claws, and lift to their mouths the collected morsels. [...] Colonized by algae, bacteria, fungi, and microscopic animals, the particle agglomerates are quite nutritious. Although most species of shrimp walk slowly about the roots as they feed, S. pacitica will undertake short swimming bursts to obtain particularly desirable items.|$|E
