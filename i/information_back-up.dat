Regarding the Durga Vahini's role in the riots, VHP {{spokesman}} Kaushikbahi Mehta said, [...] "We in the VHP {{had nothing to do with}} the violence except to take care of widows and victims of the Godhra mayhem. So was the case with the Durga Vahini". But many people claimed that white-churidar clad girls were involved in the violence. A senior police official said, [...] "They were found providing healing touch to the male activists, <b>information</b> <b>back-up</b> and if the ethnic cleansing theory is true, I have a feeling they played a significant role in intelligence network as well.

40|$|Mortality {{attributable}} to major {{causes of death}} around 1980 has been estimated for different regions in the world. The World Health Organization's mortality data bank has been employed to derive the rates for the developed areas in the world whereas for the developing areas, cause-specific mortality has been estimated {{on the basis of}} total mortality using a linear regression method. For the cause grouping chosen, infectious and parasitic diseases claim one third of all deaths in the world. Although diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms are the two most common causes of death in the developed countries, more than 50 % of all deaths in the world due to these causes occur in the developing world. Mortality due to injury and poisoning is—contrary to that due to the other main causes of death—almost independent of the level of development of the area. The results are aimed to assist the <b>information</b> <b>back-up</b> for health policies concerning the developing world. Statistics on causes of death are important and widely used for a number of purposes.

Although the investments made under the scheme, contributed to the significant reorganization of the farms as well as to employment creation, serious deficiencies were detected in the way the scheme has been designed and implemented: lack of programming logic serving specific targets and of suitable mechanisms for <b>information</b> and <b>back-up</b> of farmers on technico-organizational matters, as well as non-incorporation of the principles of programming, monitoring and assessment. The way the scheme was implemented, exemplifies the subventionist logic of income assistance, and underlines some standing characteristics in Greek agricultural policy.

40|$|The goal of {{our work}} {{is to develop a}} {{scalable}} methodology to a variety of applications requiring data fusion support for decision-making, which has direct applicability to a disaster or homeland security situation. In this work we have considered a dynamic disaster environment where an earthquake has struck and thousands of casualties are to be attended to. The fusion center outputs both L 1 fusion and L 2 fusion constructs. Using this information ambulances need to be dispatched to casualty pick-up locations and then deliver patients to an appropriate hospital. The key factors that affect the dispatching of ambulances to patient locations include patient priority, cluster information, and distance. Similarly, those affecting the dispatching of ambulances from patient locations to hospitals include waiting time estimates at hospital emergency rooms, hospital capacities, injury type, and distance. Routes also need to be generated for these ambulances. Route generation needs to take into account road damage <b>information</b> and have <b>back-up</b> routes ready whenever needed...|$|R

40|$|Massive {{improvements}} of {{the services}} in the public cloud provide many opportunities for online users. One {{of the most valuable}} services of this virtual place is the infrastructure to store data in distributed storages. The public cloud storages let different organizations and enterprises to use the high availability of data, in a cost efficient way, with lowered maintenance burden. However, utilizing the large scale capacity of (public) cloud storages is not mature trend yet among the individual customers, businesses, and organizations. The cloud storages are still unreliable places for the sensitive and confidential <b>information</b> or <b>back-up</b> copies from trust and privacy perspective. Hence, some public and private organizations, universities, as well as ordinary citizens avoid uploading their critical files to the cloud. The thesis suggests the idea of customer-oriented data storages as a solution to the shortcomings of public cloud storages. This idea would be a new way to customize the cloud storages which bears more involvement of the customer in managing aspects, as a solution to the current distrust issue on the cloudbased storages and would be a great courage to different type of customers. Furthermore, the thesis evaluates feasibility of the proposed customer-oriented cloud storage architecture based on scenarios inspired from the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) evaluation approach. Results of the evaluating discussion on the proposed solution in boosting trust in cloud storages and providing more control for cloud storage customers are presented. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|In {{his study}} - File Control: The Heart Of Business Computer Management - William G. O 2 ̆ 7 Brien, Assistant Professor, The School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University, {{initially}} informs you: “Even though computers are an everyday {{part of the}} hospitality industry, many managers lack the knowledge and experience to control and protect the files in these systems. The author offers guidelines which can minimize or prevent damage to the business as a whole. ” Our author initially opens this study with some anecdotal instances illustrating the failure of hospitality managers to exercise due caution with regard to computer supported information systems inside their restaurants and hotels. “Of the three components that make up any business computer system (data files, programs, and hard-ware), it is files that are most important, perhaps irreplaceable, to the business,” O’Brien informs you. O’Brien breaks down the noun, files, into two distinct categories. They are, the files of extrinsic value, and its counterpart the files of intrinsic value. An example of extrinsic value files would be a restaurant’s wine inventory. “As sales are made and new shipments are received, the computer updates the file,” says O’Brien. “This information might come directly from a point-of-sale terminal or might be entered manually by an employee,” he further explains. On the intrinsic side of the equation, O’Brien wants {{you to know that}} the information itself is the valuable part of this type of file. Its value is over and above the file’s informational purpose as a pragmatic business tool, as it is in inventory control. “The information is money in the legal sense For instance, figures moved about in banking system computers do not represent dollars; they are dollars,” O’Brien explains. “If the record of a dollar amount is erased from all computer files, then that money ceases to exist,” he warns. This type of information can also be bought and sold, such as it is in customer lists to advertisers. Files must be protected O’Brien stresses. “File security requires a systematic approach,” he discloses. O’Brien goes on to explain important elements to consider when evaluating file <b>information.</b> File <b>back-up</b> is also an important factor to think about, along with file storage/safety concerns. “Sooner or later, every property will have its fire, flood, careless mistake, or disgruntled employee,” O’Brien closes. “…good file control can minimize or prevent damage to the business as a whole. ...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{damage is}} on the {{increase}} due {{to a combination of}} growing vulnerability and a changing climate. This trend can be mitigated only through significantly improved flood risk management which, alongside the efforts of public authorities, will include improvements in the mitigation measures adopted by private households. Economically "reasonable" efforts to self-insure and self-protect should be expected from households before the government steps in with publicly-funded relief programmes. To gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} benefits of households' precautionary measures, telephone interviews with private home owners were conducted in the Elbe and Danube catchments in Germany after the floods of 2002 and again after the floods in 2005 and 2006. Only detached, solid single-family houses were included in this study, which is based on 759 interviews. In addition, market-based cost assessments were solicited based on a "model building". Expert interviews and a literature review – including catalogues and price lists for building materials and household appliances – were used as <b>back-up</b> <b>information</b> for the cost assessments. The comparison of costs and benefits shows that large investments, such as building a sealed cellar, are only economically efficient if the building is flooded very frequently, that is, if it is located in a high flood risk area. In such areas it would be preferable in economic terms not to build a new house at all – or else to build a house without a cellar. Small investments, however, such as oil tank protection, can prevent serious damage at low cost. Such investments are still profitable even if the building is flooded every 50 years or less on average. It could be argued that these low-cost measures should be made mandatory through the enforcement of building codes. Financial incentives built into insurance contracts coupled with limits set on governmental relief programmes would provide an economic motivation for people to invest in precautionary measures...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the level of}} success Unicef in Paraguay had in {{communicating}} its message concerning child street-workers to the press in Asunción. We also examined how the communication works between Unicef and the journalists, and how child street-workers appear in the press according to our sources. We based our study on the theoretical understanding of media logic and planned communication. These theories were useful to explain the possibilities and obstacles Unicef faces in its communication with the press. Our study builds on qualitative research interviews with journalists, communication staff at Unicef and the coordinator of the Global Agency of News, an organization that monitors how children appear in the Paraguayan press.   We found that the communication between Unicef and the journalists is very important and highly valued by both Unicef and the Paraguayan newspapers. The relationship builds on constant trade, where both parts depend on each other. Unicef needs attention from the press in order to spread its message to the general public. The journalists need Unicef because the organization works as a trustable <b>information</b> source to <b>back-up</b> their articles regarding childhood.   No one in our study was satisfied with the way child street-workers appear in the press. The children are often showed as victims or criminals and children’s rights are not always considered. A central problem is that awareness about children’s rights is low, both in the Paraguayan society and among many journalists. Unicef succeeds quite well in their communication with the journalists that are already aware of children’s rights. But the organization does not succeed in communicating with {{a big part of the}} press, as a lot of articles are still discriminative towards child street-workers...|$|R
40|$|Status {{of thermal}} cycle test results for a {{nonfunctional}} daisy-chained peripheral ceramic column grid array (CCGA) and its plastic {{ball grid array}} (PBGA) version, both having 560 I/Os, were presented {{in the last year}} conference. Test results included environmental data for three different thermal cycle regimes (- 55 / 125 °C,- 55 / 100 °C, and- 50 / 75 °C). The updated findings for these test vehicles with two different package types will be presented. In a recent reliability investigation a fully populated CCGA with 717 I/Os was also considered for assembly reliability evaluation. The functional package is a field programmable gate array that has much higher processing power than its previous version. This new package is smaller in dimension, has no interposer, and has a thinner column wrapped with copper for reliability improvement. This paper will also present thermal cycle test results for this package assembly and its plastic version with 728 I/Os, which were exposed to two different cycle regimes. The cycle profiles were those specified by IPC- 9701 A for tin-lead, i. e. - 55 to 100 °C and- 55 to 125 °C. Per IPC- 9701 A, test vehicles were built using daisy chain package and were continuously monitored. The effects of many process and assembly variables including corner staking, commonly used for improving resistance to mechanical loading such as drop and vibration loads, were also considered as part of the test matrix. Optical photomicrographs were taken at various thermal cycle intervals to document damage progress and behavior. Representative samples of these along with cross-sectional photomicrographs at higher magnification taken by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine crack propagation and failure analyses for packages are also presented. Appendix A was added to provide <b>back-up</b> <b>information</b> for IPC- 9701 A and discuss the effects of key thermal cycle parameters and projection for lead-free versus lead-based solder joints.
