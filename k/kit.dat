50|$|Originally garage <b>kits</b> were amateur-produced, and {{the term}} {{originated}} with dedicated hobbyists using their garages as workshops.

5000|$|Just {{like the}} 1:144 scale model <b>kits,</b> these 1:100 scale <b>kits</b> started {{about the same}} time, again {{starting}} from RX-78-2 Gundam. [...] "Generic" [...] 1:100 <b>kits</b> may also be called No-Grade (NG 1:100) to differentiate from other specific 1:100 <b>kits.</b> Later <b>kits</b> (from Gundam SEED onwards) are clearly inspired from the post-HG 1:100 <b>kits</b> and feature a similar or greater level of quality and detail.

5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the <b>kit</b> should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first <b>kit</b> used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a <b>kit</b> comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the <b>kit</b> of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This <b>kit</b> has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the <b>kit</b> a classic in Swedish football. The most common away <b>kit</b> has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away <b>kit</b> introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third <b>kit</b> with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black <b>kit</b> with light-grey details, the more traditional red <b>kit</b> with white trimmings, and a purple <b>kit</b> with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Until 2014, the away <b>kit</b> {{was changed}} every season, and the {{outgoing}} away <b>kit</b> became the third-choice <b>kit</b> {{if a new}} home <b>kit</b> was being introduced in the same year.

5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling <b>kit,</b> which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off <b>kit</b> can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype <b>kit</b> was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E

50|$|Trumpeter's early armor <b>kits</b> were {{reviewed}} negatively in publications such as AMPS' Boresight. Their series of T-55 <b>kits</b> were criticized {{for lack of}} accuracy and buildability issues. However, in recent years, Trumpeter's armor and artillery <b>kits</b> {{have been the subject}} of increasingly favourable comparisons with those of other manufacturers. In particular, their 1/35th scale <b>kits</b> of the KV tank series, SA-2 Guideline missile, and Karl Morser have been well received. The KV, K-5 Leopold and Karl Morser <b>kits</b> have been reviewed and are considered far better than competing <b>kits</b> of these subjects from Tamiya, Eastern Express, and DML. Their <b>kits</b> of the Pz.Kpfw. IV-based Karl Morser ammunition carriers and the German 150 mm SFH 18 have been reviewed less favorably than competing <b>kits</b> from DML on the Perth Military Modeling web site.

5|$|Bolton Wanderers had a {{long-established}} {{partnership with}} sporting goods firm Reebok, which {{was formed in}} the town.
