25|$|Due to {{the federal}} mandate to add passive restraints, <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> seat belts were added for 1987.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the XM93, the XM94 {{substitutes}} the M129 40mm grenade launcher for {{one or both of}} the <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> M134 7.62×51mm Miniguns.|$|E
25|$|In May 1993 six Black Hawks and 109 {{personnel}} from 'B' Squadron were deployed to Battambang airport in north-west Cambodia, forming the Army Aviation Group deployed {{in support of}} the United Nations peacekeeping mission in that country. The aircraft were painted in UN white and fitted with armour plating and <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> machine-guns for the operation due to the threat of ground fire. They were subsequently used to resupply UN positions along the Thai-Laos border, as well as the transportation of electoral officials and ballot boxes, and for aeromedical evacuation. The helicopters were fired on at least three times, with one receiving minor damage from small arms fire. They returned to Townsville in July 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Seat belts redesigned; {{attachment}} {{moved from}} <b>door</b> <b>mounts</b> to pillar mounts ...|$|R
60|$|The coachman {{observes that}} these are his parcels, shuts the <b>door,</b> <b>mounts</b> the box, and drives away, with the {{outsides}} grinning and the insides stretching their heads out, leaving Mr Sudberry transfixed and staring.|$|R
25|$|This {{armament}} subsystem provides <b>door</b> <b>mounts</b> {{for long}} fuselage UH-1s (UH-1D/H/N) for two M134 7.62×51mm Miniguns. The USAF also used this system on their short fuselage UH-1F/P helicopters. These weapons {{are equipped with}} chutes connected to their ejection ports that directs spent cases and links away from the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|SA-2 Samson is a twin-ducted fan VTOL utility aircraft, {{similar in}} role and {{appearance}} to the real-world UH-60 Black Hawk, Mi-8 or UH-1 Huey utility helicopters. It is armed with two <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> {{machine guns and}} two pylons near the cockpit with missile pods mounted on them. The pair of ducted-fan assemblies, each with two coaxial propellers, enable the Samson of 6,000 kilograms lifting capability by manufacturers specifications, but lifting performance is rated at 150% of that on Pandora due to the thicker atmosphere. Both ducted-fan assemblies are capable of changing blade pitch independently. From the pilot perspective, forward and aft, lift, yaw and roll authority are accomplished by similar sets of controls found in conventional helicopters. Propulsion is twin Goetz-Korman turbine generators.|$|E
25|$|Further {{upgraded}} version for the Army Air Corps, with Gem 41-1 engines and uprated gearbox of AH.5 and new, larger, composite tail rotor. Later refitted with BERP type rotor blades. Twelve new build, with 107 Lynx AH.1s converted. A small number also {{used by the}} Fleet Air Arm {{in support of the}} Royal Marines. The Lynx AH.7 can also be outfitted for the anti-armour role, with the attachment of 2 pylons, each carrying four BGM-71 TOW anti-tank guided missiles. In the light-lift role, it can carry an aircrewman armed with a cabin <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG), as well as troops for fast-rope or abseiling insertions, or regular landings. It can also transport cargo. Now replaced in the attack role by the AgustaWestland Apache attack helicopter.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> beneath the main cabin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Door</b> <b>Mounting.</b> For both face-frame and {{frameless}} kitchen cabinets, it is conventional for cabinet {{doors to}} overlay the cabinet carcase. Face-frame cabinets allow for various <b>door</b> <b>mounting</b> options. Traditional overlay doors do not abut, allowing a partial {{view of the}} face frames when the doors are closed. Full overlay cabinet doors fit closely so that they obscure the face frame when closed. A third and less conventional option for face-frame cabinets is to inset doors into, and flush with, the face frame (see below). Since frameless (see below) cabinet doors also fully overlay their carcases, the two types (frameless and full-overlay face-frame cabinets) have a similar installed appearance (when doors are closed), both may use European cup hinges, and both tend to use decorative door and drawer pulls (since {{there is no room}} for fingers at the door or drawer edge when installed).|$|R
60|$|The marshal was {{too deeply}} engrossed in {{steering}} his protected battleship {{to be aware}} of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform. The train was coming up on the other side of it. It stopped only one minute at Quicksand. What an opportunity it would offer to Calliope! He had only to step out the other <b>door,</b> <b>mount</b> the train, and away.|$|R
50|$|Nameplates {{are usually}} sold as two {{separate}} components: the manufactured nameplate insert and the nameplate holder. This setup allows the nameplate insert {{to be used}} {{in a variety of settings}} depending on the specific holder—the same plastic, wood, or metal nameplate insert can usually be removed and reinserted into another holder style with minimal effort; thereby creating a new nameplate application. Various nameplate holders range from wall and <b>door</b> <b>mounts,</b> desk holders, to cubicle hangers.|$|R
2500|$|A {{version of}} the TAT-102 (Tactical Armament Turret-102) {{designed}} specifically for use on the HH-3A helicopter, the TAT-102C mounted a single M134 Minigun in a fully traversable turret (for specifics see the information for the TAT-102A in the AH-1 Cobra entry). [...] Two such turrets were mounted on sponsons, {{one on each side}} of the aircraft. The complexity and questionable performance in the environment led to them being removed in favor of more conventional <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> weaponry.|$|E
2500|$|Two Eurocopter EC135P2 light utility {{helicopters}} {{were delivered}} to the Air Corps in November 2005. The first of four AgustaWestland AW139s were {{handed over to the}} Air Corps at Agusta's facility in Milan in November 2006. Two of the AW139 remained in Milan to provide training for Irish pilots before being flown to Ireland in December 2006. [...] These helicopters are another first for the Air Corps as they are delivered with the capability to carry <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> 7.62mm General Purpose Machine Guns.|$|E
2500|$|... 1990 {{was another}} {{carry-over}} {{year for the}} 9C1 Caprice with the only major change being <b>door</b> <b>mounted</b> seatbelts. In Michigan State Police tests, the only competition was from the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, as production of the Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury had ended during 1989. The Caprice won all six categories for 1990, having the quickest 0–100 times, the fastest road course times, the best brakes, highest top speed, the best fuel economy and the best interior ergonomics. This {{was the first time}} any car had won all six categories in Michigan State Police tests.|$|E

60|$|And seizing Mr. Lavender as if collaring him at football, {{he knocked}} off his hat, {{propelled}} {{him into the}} car, banged the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted,</b> and started at full speed, with Blink leaping and barking in front of them.|$|E
60|$|She {{was ready}} before Green, and urged on that factotum so wildly as {{to leave him}} no time to change his corduroys and 'skitty-boots' {{in which he had}} been gardening; he {{therefore}} turned himself into a coachman as far down as his waist merely--clapping on his proper coat, hat, and waistcoat, and wrapping a rug over his horticultural half below. In this compromise he appeared at the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted,</b> and reins in hand.|$|E
50|$|The small 2-seat car had {{a length}} of 2650 mm and a width of 1520 mm. The Zoom was powered by a 45 kW (61.2 hp) {{electric}} motor. It was unique in having fold up rear wheels resulting in a shorter length 2300 mm when parked. Width remains constant at 1.52m, which means Zoom is 230 mm higher in retracted wheelbase configuration. 2 scissor <b>doors</b> <b>mounted</b> on inclined axes reduce lateral bodywork clearance to a minimum and make Zoom easy {{to use in the}} tightest of spots.|$|R
50|$|The Nimbus-4DM {{is powered}} by a liquid-cooled 44 kW Bombardier Rotax 535C engine with a 3:1 belt {{reduction}} drive. The powerplant is housed in the fuselage immediately aft of the wing. An electrically driven spindle drive (jackscrew) extends the propeller pylon upwards and forward from the engine bay. When stowed, two <b>doors</b> <b>mounted</b> to the rear fuselage conceal the powerplant. The jackscrew is attached between the airframe and the upper forward end of the pylon such that when the jackscrew is retracted (shortened) the pylon is pulled upwards and forward into its flight position.|$|R
40|$|D. Tech. Mechanical Engineering. The {{level and}} quality of {{vibration}} experienced by motor vehicle occupants are issues of increasing concern and will probably be among the major challenges of the automotive industry in the twenty-first century. The vibration behaviour of door panels that enclose the passenger cabin can affect low-frequency noise in the cabin. This thesis presents the theory necessary for the development and simulation of a vibroacoustic <b>door</b> <b>mount</b> system and, thereafter, investigates its potential. Compared to the existing design, a perceivable noise reduction of 6. 15 dB(A) was achieved by using the proposed sensitivity analysis procedure...|$|R
60|$|His landlord, who {{had listened}} to these words with breathless attention, started that moment to his feet; and, without a word, drew Solomon Daisy to the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted</b> his horse, took him up behind again, and flew rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins, which that day's sun had shone upon, a stately house. Mr Willet stared after them, listened, looked down upon himself to make quite {{sure that he was}} still unbound, and, without any manifestation of impatience, disappointment, or surprise, gently relapsed into the {{condition}} from which he had so imperfectly recovered.|$|E
60|$|So saying, Mr. George went away. A moment {{afterward}} {{the children}} saw him {{going down the}} plank to the pier. As soon {{as he reached the}} pier he forced {{his way through the crowd}} to the other side of it, where the carriage was standing. The children watched him all the time. When he reached the carriage, they saw that he stopped a moment to say a few words to the driver, and then hastily got into the carriage. The driver shut the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted</b> upon the box, and then drove out through the great gate and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} {{the driver of the}} stage had {{finished}} strapping on the trunk, and had opened the door and was waiting for Stuyvesant to get in. Beechnut handed Stuyvesant a small note. He said that the Traveling Rule was inside of it, but that Stuyvesant must not open the note until he got into the car on the railroad. So Stuyvesant took the note and put it in his pocket, and then shaking hands with Beechnut and Phonny, and putting his carpet-bag in before him, he climbed up the steps and got into the stage. The driver shut the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted</b> upon the box, and drove away.|$|E

60|$|A FORTNIGHT later, and Christie was off. Mrs. Flint had briefly {{answered}} {{that she had}} a room, and that work was always {{to be found in the}} city. So the girl packed her one trunk, folding away splendid hopes among her plain gowns, and filling every corner with happy fancies, utterly impossible plans, and tender little dreams, so lovely at the time, so pathetic to remember, when contact with the hard realities of life has collapsed our bright bubbles, and the frost of disappointment nipped all our morning glories in their prime. The old red stage stopped at Enos Devon's door, and his niece crossed the threshold after a cool handshake with the master of the house, and a close embrace with the mistress, who stood pouring out last words with spectacles too dim for seeing. Fat Ben swung up the trunk, slammed the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted</b> his perch, and the ancient vehicle swayed with premonitory symptoms of departure.|$|E
60|$|But Poker Jack of Shasta had hurriedly {{declared}} {{that he wanted to}} speak to a man who was passing, and had disappeared. The doctor walked to the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted</b> his horse, and rode away. I noticed, however, that there was a slight smile on his bronzed, impassive face. This led me to wonder if he was entirely ignorant of the purpose for which he had been questioned, and the effect of his information. I was confirmed in the belief by the remarkable circumstances that nothing more was said of it; the incident seemed to have terminated there, and the victims made no attempt to revenge themselves on See Yup. That they had one and all, secretly and unknown to one another, patronized him, there was no doubt; but, at the same time, as they evidently were not sure that Dr. Duchesne had not hoaxed them in regard to the quality of See Yup's medicines, they knew that an attack on the unfortunate Chinaman would in either case reveal their secret and expose them to the ridicule of their brother miners. So the matter dropped, and See Yup remained master of the situation.|$|E
6000|$|Luxury and extravagance {{kept pace}} with this sudden {{inflation}} of fancied wealth. The hereditary palaces of nobles were pulled down, and rebuilt {{on a scale of}} augmented splendor. Entertainments were given of incredible cost and magnificence. Never before had been such display in houses, furniture, equipages, and amusements. This was particularly the case among persons of the lower ranks, who had suddenly become possessed of millions. Ludicrous anecdotes are related of some of these upstarts. One, who had just launched a splendid carriage, when about to use it for the first time, instead of getting in at the <b>door,</b> <b>mounted,</b> through habitude, to his accustomed place behind. Some ladies of quality, seeing a well-dressed woman covered with diamonds, but whom nobody knew, alight from a very handsome carriage, inquired who she was of the footman. He replied, with a sneer: [...] "It is a lady who has recently tumbled from a garret into this carriage." [...] Mr. Law's domestics were said to become in like manner suddenly enriched by the crumbs that fell from his table. His coachman, having made his fortune, retired from his service. Mr. Law requested him to procure a coachman in his place. He appeared the next day with two, whom he pronounced equally good, and told Mr. Law: [...] "Take which of them you choose, and I will take the other!" ...|$|E
5000|$|As the Type 1 Ho-Ki {{had been}} {{designed}} to carry supplies, pull artillery {{as well as to}} carry infantry, it had no rear exit hatch, it was felt that the towed weapon might interfere with the rapid exit of any onboard riflemen. Entry and exit of troops was thus accomplished from the left (driver's) side via three <b>doors</b> <b>mounted</b> side by side. The hull was welded construction and it was [...] "open-topped", akin to the Type 1 Ho-Ha. The engine, which was located at the right front of the body, was a 6-cylinder, in-line, valve-in-head, air-cooled diesel. The transmission was located in the rear.|$|R
