500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class action suits he said: [...] "It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> for very little money, but I don't {{want to do it}} out of principle." [...] Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the confessional}} song talks plainly and plaintively about the {{detachment}} and loneliness that [...] Madonna feels {{in the face}} of the press, with the singer lamenting: [...] "Each time they write a hateful word / dragging my soul into the dirt / I wanna die." [...] John Marrs of Gay Times compared the lyrical content of the song to Madonna's [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] (1998) explaining that the lyrics are essentially autobiographical as well as talks about how her outspokenness had led to the media trying to [...] "hurt her". It also talks about how although Madonna is tough at heart, she still feels the [...] "negativity"of the media. The chorus, which features skittering drums and strings, has Madonna simply saying: [...] "I don't wanna talk about <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> / even hearts made out of steel can break down." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Madonna explained the lyrics that she did not have the conviction of Joan of Arc, and is still hurt by any negative words. She further elaborated for a Rolling Stone interview: ...|$|E

500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with.

2500|$|On {{the day of}} its premiere, James Montgomery of MTV News {{gave the}} video a very {{positive}} review and breakdown, stating, [...] "So it's not exactly a stretch to call 'Moment 4 Life' the most Nicki Minaj video of all time. It takes basically every aspect of her personality — the fashionista, the glamazon, the princess, the badass, the cartoon character, the girly girl — and crams them together into one very shiny package. And then it wraps that package with nods to her past (the British accent, the mention of her Roman Zolanski alter-ego, the consummation of her Twit-lationship with Drake) for good measure. The end result {{is perhaps the most}} complete portrait of Minaj to date... There are very few silly wigs and nary a stitch of Spandex to be seen anywhere. It is basically our first glimpse at the real Nicki: a young woman who is more than just the sum of her parts, even if those parts are pretty interesting." [...] Chris Robinson of Idolator compared and contrasted the [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] wedding with other wedding music video's stating, [...] "We’re going to call <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Several {{producers}} {{were revealed}} {{to be working with}} Drake on Take Care other than Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib (who is the main producer of the album), including T-Minus, The xx Jamie Smith and Boi-1da (who is a long-time Drake collaborator). He had initially recruited 9th Wonder for the album. He even appeared on 9th's documentary The Wonder Year and expressed his desire to make a number one hit with him, however, in an interview about a month prior to the slated release date, 9th said that he was not on the album. 9th states that {{was a part of the}} reason, because he was going through an A and playing beats for them as opposed to the artist himself, which he is opposed to. Drake had also been planning on having Q-Tip, DJ Premier, and The Neptunes as producers on the album, but those projects fell through as well. Several artists were confirmed as collaborators with Drake on Take Care consist of Stevie Wonder, Kendrick Lamar, Chantal Kreviazuk, André 3000, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. He had initially reached out to Phonte of the former group Little Brother (who is a major influence on his career). The track was made for Take Care, but did not make it for the album, due to an issue he had with the producer. Drake admits in an interview to [...] "dropping the ball" [...] on the project and is optimistic about a future collaboration with Phonte. He also wanted to collaborate with Justin Timberlake stating, [...] "The song was gonna be dope," [...] it was produced by Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib. [...] "It was solid, a solid little look. But he's so immersed in the acting thing, and I don't blame him, he's doing great at it. He was just like, 'I really want to work.
