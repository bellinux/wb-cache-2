5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

In accordance with the Monroe Doctrine the United States actively opposed Canadian involvement as Canada’s foreign relations were subject to the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European power, Britain. Nevertheless, Canada remained outside of the union for reasons of economic disinterest.|$|E

25|$|First and foremost, it {{is crucial}} to realize that Iranian {{authorities}} insist on a long-term commitment and a transfer of technology as a requisite for getting a share in the market.

Iran will almost never honor the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company that does not show long-term commitment. Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects. These are rarely competitive. Breaking up contracts into smaller parts is a common practice to try to incorporate at least 30% of the contract's value in local capability and also to negotiate on specific prices.|$|E

Construction for the building began symbolically on March 17, 1930, St. Patrick's Day, per Smith's instructions. Smith's grandchildren cut the ribbon when the world's tallest skyscraper opened on May 1, 1931, which was May Day, an international labor celebration. It had been completed in a record 13 months for such a large project. As with the Brooklyn Bridge, which Smith had seen being built from his Lower East Side boyhood home, the Empire State Building was a vision and an achievement constructed by combining the interests of all, rather than being divided by <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few.|$|E

40|$|When we {{talk about}} {{withholding}} and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments {{at the end of}} life, ‘treatment duty’, ‘medical futility’, ‘self-determination’, and ‘best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patient’ are four key concepts. They are inter-correlated in a very complex way, and therefore without some clarifications, arguments tend to be entangled. This paper will examine three concepts; treatment duty, self-determination, and best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patient. A point at issue is ‘the possibility of cancellation of treatment duty’. Medial and objective standard can be established for this concept, at least in principle. That is, identifying the range that possibility of cancellation of treatment duty covers would allow discussions about patient’s self-determination and best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patient. These would, in turn, justify withholding and withdrawal of medical treatments...|$|R

He returned during 1901 and gave an account of his explorations in Im Goldland des Altertums (The Eldorado of the Ancients) (1902). During 1905 he again visited the region between the rivers Zambezi and Save.|$|E
25|$|Critical race theory {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by the language of critical legal studies, which challenged concepts such as objective truth, rationality and judicial neutrality, and by critical theory. Academics and activists disillusioned with the outcomes of the civil African-American Civil Rights Movement pointed out that though African Americans supposedly enjoyed legal equality, white Americans continued to hold disproportionate power and still had superior living standards. Liberal ideas such as meritocracy and equal opportunity, they argued, hid and reinforced deep structural inequalities and thus serves the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white elite. Critical race theorists see racism as embedded in public attitudes and institutions, and highlight institutional racism and unconscious biases. Legal scholar Derrick Bell advanced the interest convergence principle, which suggests that whites support minority rights only when doing so is also in their self-interest.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the spirit and intent of the Convention as {{conveyed}} by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors {{as a vehicle to}} litigate the child's best interests or custody. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships. These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The best <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.|$|E

25|$|It is this {{difference}} in spirit and general outlook which is the significant thing about industrial unionism. Including as it does all types of workers, from the common laborer to the most highly skilled craftsman, the industrial union {{is based on the}} conception of the solidarity of labor, or at least of that portion of it which is in one particular industry. Instead of emphasizing the divisions among the workers and fostering a narrow interest in the affairs of the craft regardless of those of the industry as a whole, it lays stress on the mutual dependence of the skilled and the unskilled and the necessity of subordinating the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small group to those of the whole body of workers. Not only is loyalty to fellow-workers in the same industry emphasized, but also loyalty to the whole working class in its struggle against the capitalist system.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|However, Edward {{may have}} entertained other plans when {{his second wife}} Ælfflaed had borne him sons. While his {{intentions}} are unknown, {{it appears to have}} been Ælfweard, Edward's eldest son by Ælfflæd, who on 17 July 924 succeeded his late father in Wessex, while the Mercians chose Æthelstan for their king. By some mishap, Ælfweard died within a month and Wessex was ceded to Æthelstan, who thereby obtained his father's entire kingdom. His accession in Wessex, however, met with considerable resistance. One indication of this is that his coronation at Kingston upon Thames was delayed until 4 December the following year (925). William notes explicitly that “a certain Ælfred” at Winchester opposed the succession on grounds that Æthelstan was a concubine's son and hence an illegitimate son. Such allegations seem to have served the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> royal contender, especially Edwin, Ælfflæd's eldest surviving son. In a royal charter for a thegn (minister) called Ælfred, Edwin subscribes as cliton “ætheling”, witnessing after Æthelstan, which implies that he was recognised as his heir to the throne. The circumstances of his death in 933 suggest that any peaceful understanding which may have existed between the half-brothers had come to an end. The Annals of St. Bertin compiled by Folcuin the Deacon note laconically that Edwin, “driven by some disturbance in his kingdom”, attempted to sail to the continent, but was caught in a storm and drowned.|$|E
