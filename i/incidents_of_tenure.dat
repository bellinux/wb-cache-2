50|$|One of {{the oldest}} actions in the royal courts was {{replevin}} which had {{its roots in the}} law of customary courts. Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (distractio). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as damage feasant. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock damage feasant, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving “gage and pledge” - a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay {{in the fact that the}} distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to put {{the medieval}} {{feoffment}} to uses into its broad historical context, portraying its origin as {{an outgrowth of the}} landholding "nobility's" desire to evade the burdens of post-Conquest Norman feudalism. Those burdens were, so far as they related to freehold lands and tenements, chiefly, the rule against devises, the prohibition (until 1290) of alienation by substitution, the <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> and the prohibition of gifts of freehold into mortmain (usually to ecclesiastical institutions). The Church's involvement with the feoffment to uses occurred in various ways: Its theologians provided a Christianized epieikeia which the Chancellor appropriated to aid disappointed cestuis - who generally had no common-law rights in the freehold realty held to their use; its canonists enunciated theories of third party enjoyment-without- ownership of freehold realty especially suited {{to the needs of the}} Franciscan Friars Minor, who were also cestuis of feoffments to uses; it registered and had jurisdiction over administration of probate of wills, which often contained instructions to feoffees. There is, indeed, evidence that ecclesiastical courts were the first to enforce feoffees' obligations, and therefore to protect cestuis, relinquishing this jurisdiction as the Chancellors of England (nearly all of whom were high-ranking ecclesiastics), began to order specific performance of the "use's" purposes. This study. concludes, therefore, that ecclesiastical contributions to the development and enforcement of the feoffment to uses up to 1535 (the year of the Statute of Uses), were pervasive, if, from the standpoint of the institutional Church, largely indirect, and occurred on both theoretical and administrative planes...|$|E

5000|$|At {{common law}} a {{feoffment}} in fee did not originally pass an {{estate in the}} sense in which the term is now understood. The purchaser took only a usufructary interest, without the power of alienation in prejudice of the lord. In default <b>of</b> heirs, the <b>tenure</b> became extinct and the land reverted to the lord. Under the system <b>of</b> English feudal <b>tenures,</b> all lands in the Kingdom, were supposed to be holden mediately or immediately of the King who was styled the [...] "lord paramount", or above all. Such tenants as held under the King immediately, when they granted out portions of their lands to inferior persons, also became lords with respect to those inferior persons, since they were still tenants with respect to the King, and thus partaking of a middle nature were called [...] "mesne" [...] or [...] "middle lords". So, if the King granted a manor to A and A granted a portion of the land to B, now B was said to hold of A, and A of the King; or in other words, B held his lands immediately of A and mediately of the King. The King was therefore styled [...] "Lord Paramount"; A was both tenant and lord, or a mesne lord, and B was called [...] "tenant paravail", or the lowest tenant. Out <b>of</b> the feudal <b>tenures</b> or holdings sprung certain rights and incidents, among those which were fealty and escheat. Both these were <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> socage <b>tenure.</b> Fealty is the obligation of fidelty which the tenant owed to the lord. Escheat was the reversion of the estate on a grant in fee simple upon a failure of the heirs of the owner. Fealty was annexed to and attendant on the reversion. They were inseparable. These <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> feudal <b>tenure</b> belonged to the lord of whome the lands were immediately holden, that is to say, to him of whom the owner for the time being purchased. These grants were called subinfeudations.|$|R

However, Oakland Athletics manager Billy Martin noticed something was amiss and asked plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate. Under questioning from Kunkel, the Mariners' head groundskeeper admitted Wills had ordered the change. Wills claimed he was trying to help his players stay in the box. However, Martin suspected that given the large number of breaking-ball pitchers on the A's staff, Wills wanted to give his players an advantage. The American League suspended Wills for two games and fined him $500. American League umpiring supervisor Dick Butler likened Wills' actions to setting the bases 88 feet apart instead of 90 feet.|$|R
60|$|Among the absurdities {{that have}} been {{circulated}} on this subject of feudality, it has been pretended that the well-known English statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation; or that the quarter-sales, fifth-sales, sixth-sales, etc., of our own leases were contrary {{to the law of}} the realm, when made. Under the common law, in certain cases <b>of</b> feudal <b>tenures,</b> the fines for alienation were an <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tenure.</b> The statute <b>of</b> quia emptores abolished that general principle, but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quarter-sales, did they see fit.

It might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son, under our statute, as to say that the law of Edward I. prevents parties from bargaining for quarter-sales. Altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions.|$|R
50|$|The {{disintegration}} of the system was carried further {{in the latter half}} of the 13th century as a consequence of changes in warfare, which were increasing the importance of foot soldiers and making the service of a knight for forty days of less value to the king. The barons, instead of paying scutage, compounded for their service by the payment of lump sums, and, by a process which is still obscure, the nominal quotas of knight-service due from each had, by the time of Edward I, been largely reduced. The knight's fee, however, remained a knight's fee, and the pecuniary <b>incidents</b> <b>of</b> military <b>tenure,</b> especially wardship, marriage, and fines on alienation, long continued to be a source of revenue to the crown. But at the Restoration (1660) tenure by knight-service was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, and with it these vexatious exactions were abolished.|$|R

40|$|Sovereignty, the plenitude of {{political}} and legal power that a modern state wields {{in relation to a}} defined territory and people and things within it, would appear fragmented in the case of Papua New Guinea. Granted that even with regard to the older and established nations the idea of an illimitable, indivisible and inalienable sovereignty cannot stand careful scrutiny, in the case of Papua New Guinea the determination of the attributes and content of sovereignty becomes even more problematic due to many factors. The most important of these is the status of customary law and its appurtenant <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> customary <b>tenure.</b> Sovereignty belonging to the nation-state paradigm of 18 th-century European traditions was imposed on Papua New Guinea at Independence. A concomitant of this type of sovereignty is a legal system comprised of the received common law and customary law. In this paper it is argued that sovereignty therefore appears fragmented, especially where land proprietorship is in issue. Mismatch between the imposed form and indigenous forms of sovereignty tends to weaken the ability of the state to maximise good and effective governance. Fragmentation of sovereignty is the consequence of divided allegiance among the populace of the state at the centre and the community at the local level, invariably the situs of particular clan or tribe land, where clan membership determines rights to the use and enjoyment of such land and its resources. The imposed sovereignty merely fractured but did not obliterate local allegiance to, and the primacy of, community solidarity. The Constitution of Papua New Guinea exacerbates the problem in its prohibition of the taking of property without 'just compensation on just terms'...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies how {{higher education}} {{policies and practices}} can affect faculty retention and proposes changes that higher education institutions need to make to retain their faculty. Faculty assessment <b>of</b> reasonableness <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations is explored in the first manuscript and faculty perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations are explored {{in the second and}} third manuscripts. Job satisfaction data from a sample of 2438 tenure-track assistant professors at research universities is used. The first manuscript investigates the reasonableness <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations as it relates to work-life balance. The focus is on whether women’s and men’s appraisal of departmental and institutional support for family-work balance and satisfaction with family-friendly policies influence their perceptions <b>of</b> reasonableness <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations. Bivariate results reveal that women are less likely than men to report that tenure expectations are reasonable. Multivariate results show that for both women and men assessment of departmental and institutional support for family-work balance and satisfaction with family-friendly policies have a positive influence on their perceptions <b>of</b> reasonableness <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations. The second manuscript explores whether women’s and men’s assessment <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> related departmental practices influence their perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations. Findings reveal that women are less likely than men to perceive the expectations for getting tenure as clear. Other results show that for both men and women assessment <b>of</b> fairness in <b>tenure</b> decision- making and in tenure evaluation, and assessment of received messages about the requirements for tenure have a significant and positive effect on their perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations. The third manuscript looks at how the intersection of gender and race influences faculty perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations. The study also seeks to identify predictors of perceptions of clarity for the intersectionality defined groups (minority women, minority men, white women, and white men). Bivariate results reveal no significant differences in minority women’s perceptions of clarity compared to all other faculty. The multivariate results show that the model does not explain minority women’s perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations as well as it explains white women’s and white men’s perceptions <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> expectations...|$|R
40|$|Until the {{decision}} of the High Court in Mabo, the universal acceptance and application of the English doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> in Australia led to the view that all titles, rights and interests in land had to be the direct consequence of some grant of the Crown. In Mabo, however, six justices of the High Court agreed that the common law, as it had been previously understood, should be changed to recognise native title rights to land; rights which do not derive from a Crown grant. The common law device adopted by the High Court to effect this change, and thereby reconcile the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> and native title when the Crown acquired sovereignty of Australia, was ‘radical title’. This two-part article examines how the Mabo High Court redefined the English doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> or, more accurately, defined the Australian doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> by developing the concept of radical title. It will be seen that in order to achieve this redefinition, the court had to clarify two interrelated aspects of the common law: the applicability of the English (feudal) doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> in Australia and the legal effect of the classification of Australia as settled. Part 1 lays the foundation for this analysis by examining the genesis of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> in pre-Conquest England and the pre-Mabo effect of the colonisation of Australia and the reception of English land. The question posed in Part 2 is twofold: first, how and why the Australian doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> with radical title as its postulate, diverges from the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> in English land law. Secondly, what are the implications, beyond recognition of native title, of the redefined doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> for Australian real property law? Crucially, it will be seen that the implications of the Australian doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> are suggested by either pre-feudal forms of landholding or the traditional exceptions to the feudal doctrine <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> which both include allodial landholding. In particular, it will be seen that the High Court’s restatement of the common law provides a basis upon which ‘Aboriginal customary law title’ can be a valid source of non-derivative common law title to land and thus an alternative to native title...|$|R
