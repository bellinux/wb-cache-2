5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations.

5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption.

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 <b>individuals</b> <b>from</b> several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years.

5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness.

5|$|Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School {{expanded}} its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots.
