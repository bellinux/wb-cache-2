5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> becomes even more dominant.|$|E

Roget and his allies journey to the Mirage Castle to confront Anise, only for her to finish pulling the <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> from the mirrors before they can stop her.

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to <b>dark</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before {{observations}} of <b>dark</b> <b>energy,</b> cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe.

5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools.
