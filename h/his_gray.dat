The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area.

500|$|Mendes called American Beauty a rite {{of passage}} film about {{imprisonment}} and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through <b>his</b> <b>gray,</b> nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, [...] "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, [...] "confined [...] nearly crossed out". The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to [...] " [...] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise". After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. Changed by Ricky's [...] "attractive, profound confidence", Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his [...] "banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could [...] "see his whole life ahead of him".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2002, Schröder {{sued the}} DDP press agency for {{publishing}} an opinion {{of public relations}} consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he [...] "would be more credible if he didn't dye <b>his</b> <b>gray</b> hair". The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair. [...] The Chancellor's spokesman said: [...] "This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesn't dye his hair, but is a serious issue regarding his word." [...] The agency's lawyer said {{that they could not}} accept a verdict which [...] "does not coincide with freedom of the press." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{would tell}} stories to {{children}} and spread The New Church gospel to the adults, receiving a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper, in return. [...] "We can hear him read now, {{just as he did}} that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay near the door, his voice rising denunciatory and thrillin—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about <b>his</b> <b>gray</b> beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius," [...] reported a lady who knew him in his later years.|$|E

On its dizzy top stands the bronze figure {{of one of the}} world's greatest captains. He is alone. Not one of his mighty lieutenants stand behind, beside or below him. His arms are folded on that breast that never knew fear, and his calm, dauntless gaze meets the morning sun as it rises, like the new prosperity of the land he loved and served so masterly, above the far distant battle fields where so many thousands of <b>his</b> <b>gray</b> veterans lie in the sleep of fallen heroes.

2500|$|The {{being who}} would later be called Apocalypse was born {{thousands}} of years ago in Aqaba. He was born with the mutant X-gene, and possibly the first living being on Earth to express it. Because of <b>his</b> <b>gray</b> skin and blue lips, his people abandoned him as an infant. He was rescued by Baal of the Sandstormers who saw the child's potential power and will to survive. Baal named him En Sabah Nur, which Marvel translates as [...] "The First One". The Sandstormers lived by the credo of survival of the fittest, believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life. It is also revealed during the Apocalypse Wars that, while still a young boy, En Sabah Nur was very generous and selfless, to the chagrin of Baal. A time-displaced Evan Sabah Nur and All-New X-Men Beast tried to save En Sabah Nur, but he allowed himself to be captured to help them escape.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Judah {{approached}} Joseph, whom he likened to Pharaoh, and recounted how Joseph {{had asked the}} 10 brothers whether they had a father or brother, and they {{had told him that}} they had a father who was an old man (Jacob), and a child of his old age who was a little one (Benjamin), whose brother was dead, who alone was left of his mother (Rachel), and whose father loved him. Judah recalled how Joseph had told the brothers to bring their younger brother down to Egypt, they had told Joseph that the lad's leaving would kill his father, but Joseph had insisted. Judah recalled how the brothers had told their father Joseph's words, and when their father had told them to go again to buy a little food, they had reminded him that they could not go down without their youngest brother. Judah recounted how their father had told them that his wife had born him two sons, one had gone out and was torn in pieces, and if they took the youngest and harm befell him, it would bring down <b>his</b> <b>gray</b> hairs with sorrow to the grave. Judah began to explain to Joseph what would happen if Judah were to come to his father without the lad, seeing that his father's soul was bound up with the lad's.
