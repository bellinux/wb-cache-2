Previous work has shown that adult males produce a number of chemicals, and these have been implicated in attraction between the sexes. Volatiles were collected from insects by air aeration and trapping on Porapak resin and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers. Males produced large amounts of homo-γ-bisabolene identified previously and smaller amounts of bisabolene and <b>vanillin.</b> <b>Ethyl</b> acrylate could not be detected, although reported previously. Females did not produce any of these compounds. These compounds were produced by males only during the light period and only after reaching sexual maturity. When disturbed, {{both males and females}} produced (E) - 2 -hexenal, tridecane, (E) - 2 -octenal and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal, compounds shown to be produced from glands in the thorax and thought {{to play a role in}} defense against predators. In analyses of volatiles from male or female bugs by gas chromatography linked to electroantennographic (EAG) recording, no significant responses were obtained from male antennae. In most analyses, no EAG responses were obtained from the antennae of female bugs, but in a very few cases a response to the homo-γ-bisabolene in collections from male bugs was observed.

The pyrolysis of the black wattle wood used for obtaining charcoal is performed in brick ovens, with the gas fraction being sent directly into the environment. The present study examines the condensable compounds present in the liquor produced from black wattle wood at different thermal degradation conditions, using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Branches of black wattle were thermally degraded at controlled ambient and temperature conditions. Overall, a higher variety of compounds were obtained under atmospheric air pressure than under synthetic air pressure.

40|$|Iodine is a {{well known}} {{antimicrobial}} compound. Laccase, an oxidoreductase which couples the one electron oxidation of diverse phenolic and non-phenolic substrates to the reduction of oxygen to water, is capable of oxidizing unreactive iodide to reactive iodine. We have shown previously that laccase-iodide treatment of spruce wood results in a wash-out resistant antimicrobial surface. In this study, we investigated whether phenolic compounds such as vanillin, which resembles sub-structures of softwood lignin, can be directly iodinated by reacting with laccase and iodide, resulting in compounds with antifungal activity. HPLC-MS analysis showed that vanillin was converted to iodovanillin by laccase catalysis at an excess of potassium iodide. No conversion of vanillin occurred {{in the absence of}} enzyme. The addition of redox mediators in catalytic concentrations increased the rate of iodide oxidation ten-fold and the yield of iodovanillin by 50 %. Iodinated phenolic products were also detected when o-vanillin, <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin,</b> acetovanillone and methyl vanillate were incubated with laccase and iodide. At an increased educt concentration of 0. 1 M an almost one to one molar ratio of iodide to vanillin could be used without compromising conversion rate, and the insoluble iodovanillin product could be recovered by simple centrifugation.

40|$|Background Electronic {{cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) are advertised {{to tobacco}} users {{as a tool}} to decrease cigarette consumption and to reduce toxic exposure associated with conventional tobacco smoking. Little is known about the compounds contained in such products, their exposure and long-term health effects. Methods NMR spectroscopy was used to ascertain the content of several constituents of e-cigarette liquids including nicotine, solvents and some bioactive flavour compounds. Risk assessment was based on probabilistic exposure estimation and comparison with toxicological thresholds using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach. Results In 54 samples of e-cigarette liquids, the average nicotine content was 11 mg/ml. Only 18 from 23 samples were confirmed as nicotine-free samples and in one e-cigarette liquid nicotine was not detected while being declared on the labelling. Major compounds of e-cigarette liquids include glycerol (average 37 g/ 100 g), propylene glycol (average 57 g/ 100 g) and ethylene glycol (average 10 g/ 100 g). Furthermore, 1, 3 -propanediol, thujone and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin</b> were detected in some samples. The average exposure for daily users was estimated as 0. 38 mg/kg bw/day for nicotine, 8. 9 mg/kg bw/day for glycerol, 14. 5 mg/kg bw/day for 1, 2 -propanediol, 2. 1 mg/kg bw/day for ethylene glycol, and below 0. 2 mg/kg bw/day for the other compounds. The MOE was below 0. 1 for nicotine, but all other compounds did not reach MOE values below 100 except ethylene glycol and 1, 2 -propanediol. Conclusions NMR spectroscopy is a useful and rapid method to simultaneously detect several ingredients in e-cigarette liquids. From all compounds tested, only nicotine may reach exposures that fall into a high risk category with MOE < 1. Therefore, e-cigarette liquid products should be subjected to regulatory control to ensure consistent nicotine delivery.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A {{pilot scale}} {{demonstration}} of a biological permeable barrier {{was conducted in}} a pentachlorophenol-contaminated aquifer at a wood preserving facility. A permeable reactor was constructed to fit within a large diameter well. Arranged in series, a cylindrical reactor 24 " x 36 " (0. 61 x 0. 91 m) (diameter x height) was partitioned to provide three biological treatment zones. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) biodegradation was evaluated under several environmental conditions using a mixed microbial consortium supported on ceramic saddles. Imitation vanilla flavoring (IVF), a mixture of propylene glycol, guaiacol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin</b> and sodium benzoate, served as the electron donor. In the absence of exogenous substrate, PCP was not degraded in the inoculated permeable barrier. Substrate addition under oxidizing conditions also failed to initiate PCP removal. Anaerobic conditions however, promoted in-situ PCP degradation. PCP reductive dechlorination resulted in the transient production of 3, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol through sequential ortho dechlorinations. Continued carbon reduction at the meta and para positions resulted in 3, 4 -dichlorophenol and 3, 5 -dichlorophenol production. Complete removal of all intermediate degradation products was observed. Reactor operation was characterized through two independent laboratory and field companion studies. Experiments were conducted to evaluate (1) the effect of supplemental electron donor concentration (IVF) and (2) the effect of sulfate, a competitive electron acceptor on PCP reductive dechlorination. Results from laboratory and field conditions were consistent. (1) In {{the presence of an}} exogenous electron donor, PCP degradation was independent of supplemental donor concentration (10, 25, 50, 100 mg COD/L). However, a comparatively slower rate of PCP degradation was observed in the absence of electron donor. (2) The presence of sulfate was not inhibitory to PCP degradation. However, compared to systems evaluated in the absence of sulfate, slower rates of PCP transformation were observed.

40|$|Moths use {{chemical}} signals {{emanating from}} food to find sites for oviposition and subsequent larval feeding. By identifying these odours, novel approaches to pest management can be developed, such as monitoring of females in pest populations. The pyralid moths studied in this thesis, the almond moth (Ephestia cautella), the Mediterranean flour moth (E. kuehniella) and the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) are severe worldwide pests {{of a variety}} of stored products. The aim was to find food-derived chemical signals that are attractive to and mediate oviposition behaviour in females. Both sexes of E. cautella and P. interpunctella were attracted to and landed on three chocolate products in a flight tunnel. Chocolate is mainly infested by E. cautella, but the chocolate products were also suitable food for P. interpunctella in our laboratory. Behavioural activity was also observed when testing extracts of the chocolate products. Three compounds were identified by mass spectrometry after electrophysiological investigation of the moths' antennae, i. e. <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin,</b> nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde. A blend of the three compounds evoked the whole behavioural sequence including landing rates corresponding to that of the chocolate products. Chocolate extracts were active on antennae of both sexes of E. kuehniella as well. This species is specialised on cereal products, making the responses to chocolate compounds unexpected, but the identified compounds, namely benzyl alcohol, nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde, might also be found in cereal products. The chemicals stimulated oviposition in E. kuehniella females when presented one by one. A blend of the three compounds trapped males in a small-scale trapping experiment in tents. The results from these two behavioural studies indicate that chocolate-derived volatiles might have a future in pest management of the moths. Water was attractive to E. cautella in a trapping experiment in a chocolate factory. The water did not trap any E. kuehniella when tested in a flour mill. Water is attractive to E. cautella since it is probably a limited resource for this species, whereas E. kuehniella is more adapted to dry habitats. Experience was shown {{to play a role in}} the search for food in E. cautella and P. interpunctella. The influence of exposure during adult emergence was most pronounced on the most crucial behaviour for larval viability, i. e. the oviposition. Flight behaviour, in response to food odours, was also enhanced by prior exposure during adult emergence and larval feeding experience had some enhancing effect on E. cautella flight behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Neuroscience, Washington State UniversityVagal afferent neurons relay meal-related {{signals from}} the gut to the {{hindbrain}} nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) providing key controls of feeding and gastrointestinal reflexes. Centrally, vagal afferents form strong excitatory synapses with NTS neurons and release glutamate via three distinct processes; synchronous, asynchronous, and spontaneous. Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels expressed on vagal afferent terminals control specific forms of glutamate release and determine the nature of information transfer. This dissertation further explores the contributions of TRP channels to vagal afferent signaling. Results from previous work and in Chapter One, reveal that while TRPV 1 contributes to control of quantal forms of glutamate release, the absence of TRPV 1 only incompletely diminishes asynchronous release, while temperature sensitive spontaneous release is preserved. From these findings we concluded that additional TRP channels contribute to these forms of glutamate release and established criteria to identify additional TRP channel contributions. In Chapter Two, we identify and characterize the contribution of TRPV 3 vagal afferent signaling. We determined that TRPV 3 was present in vagal afferent neurons in very low abundance. Furthermore, we showed that FPP was a selective agonist for TRPV 3 in primary nodose neurons compared to <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin</b> (EVA) and Eugenol, both of which we showed to be non-selective TRPV 3 agonists. While low in abundance, TRPV 3 appeared to enhance sensitivity to other TRP agonists. In Chapter Three, we focused on TRPA 1 and observed that TRPA 1 is expressed in high abundance and makes strong contributions to glutamate release from vagal afferent neurons. Furthermore, we discovered that EVA, a reported TRPV 3 agonist, is actually a selective TRPA 1 agonist. These observations are reported in Chapter Four in which we compare and contrast channel activation by EVA and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a common and selective agonist for TRPA 1. In Chapters Three and Four we also show that TRPA 1 not only co-expresses with TRPV 1 but interacts with TRPV 1 within native tissues. Collectively, these findings describe contributions of TRPV 3 and TRPA 1 in vagal afferent signaling and suggest their importance in the satiety control and other autonomic reflex pathways.

40|$|The Vanillin {{project was}} {{undertaken}} by AECI {{as it was}} believed that with the raw materials available from SASOL i. e. cresols, {{it would be possible to}} develop a process that would be globally competitive. A process for preparing both vanillin and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillin</b> was developed by AECI’s Research and Development Department using a mixed m- and p-cresol stream as feed. The displacement of bromide by methoxide is very successful when using a dimethyl formamide (DMF) /alcohol solvent system and excellent conversions (> 95 %) and selectivities (> 95 %) may be obtained. However, the use of DMF, which poses a serious chronic health risk, is unacceptable in this process since the products are intended for use as food and flavouring chemicals. In view of the above the main objectives of this study were: · To find a suitable alternative solvent system, which could produce comparable results while still being economically viable; · To develop an appropriate experimental protocol in the laboratory based on the alternative solvent system; · To determine the important reaction variables by conducting statistically designed experiments; · To optimise the reaction to produce a reproducible and robust experimental protocol; and · To test the reaction thoroughly at bench-scale level and to obtain experimental data for scale-up to pilot plant The most promising alternative solvent system was a methanol/methyl acetate mixture, which produced satisfactory results in the preliminary assessment (conversion of 98. 3 % and selectivity of 92. 0 %). DMA and acetonitrile also produced promising results but were not considered for further investigation because of toxicity and cost issues. A set of statistically designed experiments was carried out on the methanol/methyl acetate solvent system where four variables were tested i. e., substrate concentration, temperature, catalyst loading, and methanol to methyl acetate volume ratio. The experimentally determined response surface model showed that the most important variable was catalyst loading (63. 2 %) for conversion. With respect to selectivity, the most important variables were catalyst loading (31. 9 %) and methanol to methyl acetate ratio (33. 1 %). The optimum reaction conditions were as follows: · Temperature: 120 °C · Methanol:methyl acetate: 15 : 1 vol/vol · Catalyst loading: 8 mol % to substrate · Substrate concentration: 22 %m/m on solvent · Catalyst: Copper(I) bromide · Sodium Equivalents: 2. 7 wrt substrate · Time: 3 hours The optimum conditions were tested for reproducibility in a 1 Labmax pressure reactor. Replicated reactions, two at a 10 % and two at a 20 % substrate concentration gave conversions and selectivities all greater than 90 %. Although the reaction mixture was a slurry at these concentrations, the reactions were very fast and virtually complete within the first hour (~ 95 % conversion). Initial scale-up studies were conducted in an 8 Parr reactor where five reactions were carried out using the optimum conditions described above. The conversion of substrate and vanillin selectivity was consistently high and compared favourably to the Labmax reactions. The average conversion was 97. 3 % (96. 3 to 98. 5 %) at an average selectivity of 98. 2 % (97. 4 to 99. 1 %). A study of the reaction kinetics confirmed that the reaction was first order with respect to the substrate as a plot of substrate concentration versus reaction rate gave a straight line. The rate constant was calculated as 1. 1096 k(h- 1). The reaction mechanism proposed for the copper assisted nucleophilic aromatic substitution involves the formation of an adduct between sodium methoxide, methyl acetate and copper(I) bromide. The formation of a transient intermediate with the substrate allows intramolecular delivery of the methoxide ion to the aryl moiety through a CuI – CuIII type cycle...|$|E
