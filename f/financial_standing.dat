After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their <b>financial</b> <b>standing</b> by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good <b>financial</b> <b>standing.</b> In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E

5|$|When Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886 by munition workers' from Woolwich, the club {{resisted}} the lure of professionalism and remained an amateur side. Success in local cup competitions soon followed, and a tie against Derby County in the FA Cup on 17 January 1891 led to the opposition approaching two of Arsenal's players, in view of offering them professional contracts. Later that year the club resigned its membership of the Kent County and London Football Associationsboth amateur governing bodiesand voted to turn professional, a move which attracted criticism from many southern clubs. In 1893, the club received an invitation to join the Football League, which the board accepted. Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, while also participating in regional competitions, the Southern Combination and United League. The club won promotion in 1904, and enjoyed strong FA Cup campaigns in the mid-1900s, but the increase of football clubs in the capital and falling attendances at the Manor Ground pushed Arsenal close to bankruptcy by 1910. Sir Henry Norris and William Hall in that year took over Arsenal, and planned to relocate the team to Highbury {{in order to improve}} their <b>financial</b> <b>standing.</b> Arsenal were relegated back to the Second Division in 1913, but the move to North London brought about larger attendances than ever before.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the use of {{accounting}} disclosure in equity crowdfunding to understand how accounting and financial reporting facilitates start-up financing. Results find no relation between historical accounting disclosure and start-up capital obtained from crowdfunding investors, on average.

This study also examines investors’ demand for the financial health of crowdfunding campaigns that disclose financial statements, through the use of traditional accounting ratios, and finds that investors may not take in to consideration the current <b>financial</b> <b>standings</b> of the companies they choose to invest in. Finally, this study finds a negative relation between the number of investors a campaign attracts and the entrepreneur’s long-term forecasts of expected future profits. The results provide insight into the demand for financial reporting in an unregulated market, and informs the debate on proposed crowdfunding regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{overview}} {{of this paper}} is about municipal solid waste management in Cameroon and suggested methods for improvement. Garbage bins for sorting has been mentioned in this paper as one of the major infrastructure needed in all the areas, particularly in the low standards areas. The installation of garbage bins for source separation, building of transfer stations next to paved roads have been mentioned as one of the primary solution for both the waste vehicles and households. This will increase the waste collection system and will reduce illegal dumping of waste. Population, urbanisation and industrial growth has also been mentioned in this paper as one of the main causes of increase waste generation that has lead to illegal dumping of waste in unwanted areas. Low level of education, inadequate <b>financial</b> <b>standings</b> or resources, poor enforcement of waste management regulations and governance has often led to major waste management problems in Cameroon. This paper also presents a vital analysis of the distance between garbage bins and households as well as possible solutions.
