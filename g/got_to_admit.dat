6000|$|There was {{no change}} of tone, at least, with the elder gentlemen. They plainly showed me an added respect. And so I {{fell into the}} habit, after my work was over, of joining them in their suppers rather than the sons and daughters. There I was made right welcome. The serious {{conversation}} spiced with the wit of trained barristers and men of affairs better suited my changed condition of life. The times were sober, {{and for those who}} could see, a black cloud was on each horizon. 'Twas only a matter of months when the thunder-clap was to come-indeed, enough was going on within our own province to forebode a revolution. The Assembly to which many of these gentlemen belonged was in a righteous state of opposition to the Proprietary and the Council concerning the emoluments of colonial officers and of clergymen. Honest Governor Eden had the misfortune to see the justice of our side, and was driven into a seventh state by his attempts to square his conscience. Bitter controversies were waging in the Gazette, and names were called and duels fought weekly. For our cause [...] "The First Citizen" [...] led the van, and the able arguments and moderate language of his letters soon identified him as Mr. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the greatest men Maryland has ever known.

However, in the modern day, learning Marian is actually Zelena almost made up for it. They shouldn't get in the habit of bringing back blasts from the past, but Zelena has the potential to shake things up so much that her return is worth it. Since she's also searching for the Author though, {{it would have been better}} to tie him more into the story considering what happened in the previous episode." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.2 rating out of 10.

(Jones) has looked at me and said, 'Maybe next year,' but who knows.

But here I am 25 years down the line considering the thing." [...] Besides a Big Audio Dynamite reunion, Letts said he was also hopeful for more Legacy Editions of the group's albums after finding more unreleased material—including live recordings—in the vaults. [...] "There's definitely more stuff; whether Sony thinks it's worthwhile, that's another matter. But there seems to be a lot of respect for Big Audio Dynamite. Time has shown that a lot of the things we were dabbling in back then have come to manifest themselves today...so hopefully we'll get to do some more." ...|$|E

6000|$|We four always spread {{our common}} stock of {{blankets}} {{together on the}} frozen ground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish, long-legged hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> him <b>to</b> the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the dog's warm back to his breast and finding great comfort in it. But in the night the pup would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man's back and shove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then, being warm and snug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man's back simply in excess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and in his sleep tug at the old man's back hair and bark in his ear. The old gentleman complained mildly about these familiarities, at last, {{and when he got}} through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not a proper animal <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> bed with tired men, because he was [...] "so meretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions."

5000|$|Three {{weeks to}} the day after Kennedy's assassination, the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee gave Dylan their annual Tom Paine award for his {{contribution}} to the civil rights movement. Dylan gave an acceptance speech at the awards ceremony held at Hotel Americana in New York. In his closing remarks, he stated the following: [...] "I want to accept this award, the Tom Paine Award, from the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee. I want to accept it in my name but I'm not really accepting it in my name and I'm not accepting it in any kind of group's name, any Negro group or any other kind of group. There are Negroes - I was on the march on Washington up on the platform and I looked around at all the Negroes there and I didn't see any Negroes that looked like none of my friends. My friends don't wear suits. My friends don't have to wear suits. My friends don't have to wear any kind of thing to prove that they're respectable Negroes. My friends are my friends, and they're kind, gentle people if they're my friends. And I'm {{not going to try to}} push nothing over. So, I accept this reward - not reward, (Laughter) award in behalf of Phillip Luce who led the group to Cuba which all people should go down to Cuba. I don't see why anybody can't go to Cuba. I don't see what's going to hurt by going any place. I don't know what's going to hurt anybody's eyes to see anything. On the other hand, Phillip is a friend of mine who went to Cuba. I'll stand up and to get uncompromisable about it, which I have to be to be honest, I just got to be, as I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the man who shot President Kennedy, Lee Oswald, I don't know exactly where … what he thought he was doing, but I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> honestly that I too - I saw some of myself in him. I don't think it would have gone - I don't think it could go that far. But I got to stand up and say I saw things that he felt, in me - not to go that far and shoot. (Boos and hisses) You can boo but booing's got nothing to do with it. It's a - I just a - I've got to tell you, man, it's Bill of Rights is free speech and I just want to admit that I accept this Tom Paine Award in behalf of James Forman of the Students Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and on behalf of the people who went to Cuba. (Boos and Applause)" [...] After the ceremony, a number of eyewitnesses reported that Dylan seemed very nervous and was drinking quite heavily before giving his speech.|$|E
5000|$|The newly {{reformed}} Allman Brothers began touring heavily, {{which helped}} {{build a new}} fan base: [...] "We had to build a fan base all over again, but as word of mouth spread about how good the music was, {{more and more people}} took notice. It felt great, man, and that really helped the music", Allman recalled. Neel left the group and the band added percussionist Marc Quiñones, formerly of Spyro Gyra, the following year. They recorded two more studio albums—Shades of Two Worlds (1992) and Where It All Begins (1994). Allman's daughter, Island, came to live with him in Los Angeles, and despite early struggles, they eventually grew very close. [...] "Island is the love of my life, she really is", he would later write. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could barely make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. He hired two in-home nurses that switched twelve-hour shifts to help him through the process. He was immensely happy to finally quit alcohol, writing later in his autobiography: [...] "Did I get any positive anything out of all that? And you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to yourself, no, I didn’t. You can see what happened and that by the grace of God, you finally quit before it killed you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reaction to {{the album}} upon its release in the UK in July 1977 was largely negative: the British music press, more {{interested}} in the developing UK punk scene, was oriented towards guitar-based music and hostile to most electronic music. The NME derided Oxygène as [...] "just another interminable cosmic cruise. The German spacers (Dream, Schulze et al) mapped this part of the electronic galaxy aeons ago... The album's ... infuriatingly derivative. Explore its prime influences instead." [...] Likening the album to a French version of Mike Oldfield's work, Music Week said: [...] "Unfortunately Jarre has produced a work that is ponderous in its self-conscious musicality - he definitely wears his art on his sleeve. Unlike Oldfield he never stands back and laughs at his own creation. It is heavy throughout, and his influences continually jog the elbow - particularly the lugubrious touches of Mahler and the almost continuous Bach underpinning... some interest will be generated but the album is not really suited to our insular and musically anti-intellectual Anglo-Saxon island." [...] Melody Maker was kinder towards the album, saying: [...] "The first time I heard this album I hated it. It seemed so bland, so undemanding, so uneventful... I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it repays further listening, and that it is not quite the electronic Muzak I had written it off as initially." [...] The review noted that the album was composed {{in the same manner as}} classical music, rather than rock music, and concluded: [...] "On the other hand, Oxygène is not classical music. Though the track the discos are playing to [...] "Oxygène Part IV" [...] is, as you might expect, actually its least effective section musically, it has the same relationship to popular music as Tangerine Dream, say, or Oldfield. Personally, it still does not impress me as much as either, except at a technical level. It seems to lack heart, the sense of passionate involvement in the act of music-making which makes Edgar Froese's work almost a musical equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting. It is almost too accomplished, too formally precise." [...] A retrospective review by AllMusic's Jim Brenholts gave the album a top rating, writing that it was [...] "one of the original e-music albums" [...] and had [...] "withstood the test of time and the evolution of digital electronica".|$|E
