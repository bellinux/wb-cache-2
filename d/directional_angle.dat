The initial conditions of flow and temperature are those of a free convection flow without the cylinder oscillations.

The velocity field is computed with a two-dimensional laminar flow code, and the temperature distribution is calculated simultaneously by iteration. For numerical convenience, the coordinate is chosen to be fixed with the circular cylinder. Thus the problem is also regarded as the free convection from the heated circular cylinder enhanced by oscillating flows.

40|$|Reflected solar {{radiative}} fluxes emerging for the Earth's top of {{the atmosphere}} are inferred from satellite broadband radiance measurements by applying bidirectional reflectance functions (BDRFs) {{to account for the}} anisotropy of the radiation field. BDRF's are dependent upon the viewing geometry (i. e. solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle), the amount and type of cloud cover, the condition of the intervening atmosphere, and the reflectance characteristics of the underlying surface. A set of operational Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) BDRFs is available which was developed from the Nimbus 7 ERB (Earth Radiation Budget) scanner data for a three-angle grid system, An improved set of bidirectional reflectance is required for mission planning and data analysis of future earth radiation budget instruments, such as the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and for the enhancement of existing radiation budget data products. This study presents an analytic expression for BDRFs formulated by applying a fit to the ERBE operational model tabulations. A set of model coefficients applicable to any viewing condition is computed for an overcast and a clear sky scene over four geographical surface types: ocean, land, snow, and desert, and partly cloudy scenes over ocean and land. The models are smooth in terms of the <b>directional</b> <b>angles</b> and adhere to the principle of reciprocity, i. e., they are invariant with respect to the interchange of the incoming and outgoing <b>directional</b> <b>angles.</b> The analytic BDRFs and the radiance standard deviations are compared with the operational ERBE models and validated with ERBE data. The clear ocean model is validated with Dlhopolsky's clear ocean model. Dlhopolsky developed a BDRF of higher angular resolution for clear sky ocean from ERBE radiances. Additionally, the effectiveness of the models accounting for anisotropy for various viewing directions is tested with the ERBE along tract data. An area viewed from nadir and from the side give two different radiance measurements but should yield the same flux when converted by the BDRF. The analytic BDRFs are in very good qualitative agreement with the ERBE models.

The volume of the mercury in the container is equal to half of the container’s. When the detected surface is horizontal, the shape of mercury in the image captured by the camera is a black disc since the mercury is lightproof. When the detected surface tilts, the mercury flows and the mercury surface always maintains horizontally due to the gravity force of the earth. At this time, some area of the transparent cone-shaped closed container is not shaded by mercury and {{the border of the}} mercury’s shape in the captured image is a half circle and a half ellipse.

We also explore quantum statistical properties of photons in the superradiance and subradiance by addressing the second-order correlation function. In particular, when the initial state of the two separated atoms is the Werner state with non-zero QD, we find that radiation photons in the superradiant region exhibit the nonclassical sub-Poissonian statistics and the degree of the sub-Poissonian statistics increases with increasing of the QD amount, while radiation photons in the subradiant region have either the sub-Poissonian or super-Poissonian statistics depending on the amount of QD and the <b>directional</b> <b>angle.</b> In the subradiant regime we predict the QD-induced photon statistics transition from the super-Poissonian to sub-Poissonian statistics.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{investigated}} about {{the relation between}} a directional audibility and a lateral line shape of fish. He assumed geometrically the seven types of lateral line shape on account of easiness for calculation; ①･･･linear type, ②･･･interrupted linear type, ③･･･semicircular and linear type, ④･･･stepped linear type, ⑤･･･parallel type, ⑥･･･horse-mackerel's (Trachurus') type, ⑦･･･general type. He assumed, furthermore, the values of biophysical conditions as follows; propagating velocity of under-water sound V (= 150000 cm/s), transmitting velocity of sensation by sound stimuli on a lateral nurve υ (= 2600 cm/s), attenuation constant of under-water sound α^{+ 1 } (= 10 ^{-δ/ 10000 }), space distance from 1 st receptor to 2 nd one δ (cm), length along a lateral line between the two receptors l (cm), the most suitable (sensible) frequency ν (cycle/sec). Then, he got the values in the Table 1 from the equations - (by physical condition); ν=(V/ 2 πδ) ×cos^{- 1 }(α^{± 1 }), (by biological condition); l≧υ/ν. By means of the diagramatic method, shown in Fig. 2, he got the audible directions in various types of lateral line as Fig. 3, ①~⑦. In these figures, the ranged length of equi-frequency arcline in dotted zone means the <b>directional</b> <b>angle</b> of audibility for the frequency sound against the original point (sensorium of fish). As a result of judging these figures, he concluded as follows: a) The maximum value of the most sensible frequency is 5200 ~ 8700 c/s, in the virtical direction. b) The minimum value of the one is 112 ~ 130 c/s {{in the direction of}} body axis (a bit of upward frontally in some types). The stronger sound, however, shall not be equall to this frequency (, may be lower). c) The <b>directional</b> <b>angle</b> of audibility for 200 ~ 300 c/s sound is very broad. This means that this (200 ~ 300 c/s) sound may be serious for fish in these coditions. d) Among these seven types of lateral line, the directional audibility of semic-ircular & linear type is the most splendid and broadest; on the other hand, the one of simple linear type is very poor and narrow. The author expected that his conclusion might be recognized with biophsical experiments, and he pointed that it was needed to use many knowledges; for examples, the actual values of nurvous conditions (refractory period and transmitting velocity of sensation and etc. in control fish), its influences by water temperature or salinity, the utility of echoless aquarium, and the methods to pick up an active potential of lateral nurve under the natural stimulus of sound in water...|$|E

Beam width is commonly defined to be the <b>directional</b> <b>angle</b> spread within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold.

A set of temperature, salinity and current profile records was acquired. The characteristics of these observations are analyzed in this paper. Some main results are achieved as below. (1) Temperature generally decreases while salinity generally increases with increasing depth. The average values of all records are 2. 98 degrees C and 32. 21 psu. (2) Salinity and temperature are well negatively correlated, and the correlation coefficient between them is - 0. 84. However, they did not always vary synchronously. Their co-variation featured different characters during different significant periods. (3) The average velocity for the whole water column is 141 mm/s with <b>directional</b> <b>angle</b> of 347. 1 degrees. The statistical distribution curve of velocity record number gets narrower with increasing depth. More than 85 % of the recorded velocities are northward, and the mean magnitudes of dominated northward velocities are 100 - 150 mm/s.

We used the pixel-level burned area from LANDSAT images, {{as well as two}} global products: MODIS MCD 45 A 1 and the European Space Agency (ESA) fire Climate Change Initiative (FIRE_CCI) product for the 2002 – 2009 time period. Individual fire patches were compared by linear regressions to test the consistency of global products as a source of burned patch shape information. Despite commission and omission errors respectively reaching 0. 74 and 0. 81 for ESA FIRE_CCI and 0. 64 and 0. 62 for MCD 45 A 1 when compared to LANDSAT due to missing small fires, correlations between patch areas showed R 2 > 0. 6 for all comparisons, with a slope of 0. 99 between ESA FIRE_CCI and MCD 45 A 1 but a lower slope (0. 6 – 0. 8) when compared to the LANDSAT data. Shape complexity between global products was less correlated (R 2 = 0. 5) with lower values (R 2 = 0. 2) between global products and LANDSAT data, due to their coarser resolution. For the morphological features of the ellipse fitted over fire patches, R 2 reached 0. 6 for the ellipse’s eccentricity and varied from 0. 4 to 0. 8 for its azimuthal <b>directional</b> <b>angle.</b> We conclude that global BA products underestimate total BA as they miss small fires, but they also underestimate burned patch areas.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{interactions between}} long surface waves and interfacial waves in a two-layer fluid are studied theoretically. The fluid is density-stratified and the thicknesses {{of the top}} and bottom layers are both assumed to be shallow relative to the length of a typical surface wave and interfacial wave, respectively. A set of Boussinesq-type equations are derived for potential flow in this system. The equations are then analyzed for the dynamics of the nonlinear resonant interactions between a monochromatic surface wave and two oblique interfacial waves. The analysis uses a second order perturbation approach. Consequently, a set of coupled transient evolution equations of wave amplitudes is derived. Moreover, the effect of weak viscosity of the lower layer is incorporated in the problem and the influences of important parameters on surface and interfacial wave evolution (namely the <b>directional</b> <b>angle</b> of interfacial waves, density ratio of the layers, thickness of the fluid layers, surface wave frequency, surface wave amplitude, and lower layer viscosity) are investigated. The results of the parametric study are discussed and are generally in qualitative agreement with previous studies. In shallow water, a triad formed of surface waves (or interfacial waves) can be considered in near-resonant interaction. In contrast to the previous studies which limited the study to a triad (one surface wave and two interfacial waves or one interfacial and two surface waves), the problem is generalized by considering the nonlinear interactions between a triad of surface waves and three oblique pairs of interfacial waves. In this system, each surface wave is in near-resonance interaction with other surface waves and in exact resonance with a pair of oblique interfacial waves. Similarly, each interfacial wave is in near-resonance interaction with other interfacial waves which are propagating in the same direction. Inclusion of all the interactions considerably changes the pattern of evolution of waves and highlights the necessity of accounting for several wave harmonics. Effects of density ratio, depth ratio, and surface wave frequency on the evolution of waves are discussed. Finally, a formulation is derived for spatial evolution of one surface wave spectrum in nonlinear interaction with two oblique interfacial wave spectra. The two-layer Boussinesq-type equations are treated in frequency domain to study the nonlinear interactions of time-harmonic waves. Based on weakly two-dimensional propagation of each wave train, a parabolic approximation is applied to derive the formulation...|$|E

The lumbar motion angles were estimated using simple linear regression analysis based on the stretch sensor outputs and compared with those obtained by the optical motion capture system. Results The estimated lumbar motion angles showed a good correlation with the actual angles, with correlation values of r = 0. 68 (SD = 0. 35), r = 0. 60 (SD = 0. 19), and r = 0. 72 (SD = 0. 18) for the flexion-extension, side bending, and rotation movements, respectively (all P < 0. 05). The estimation errors in all three directions were less than 3 °. Conclusion The stretch sensors mounted on the back provided reasonable estimates of the lumbar motion angles. The novel motion capture system provided three <b>directional</b> <b>angles</b> without capture space limits.

40|$|Body movements, such as trunk flexion and rotation, are {{risk factors}} for low back pain in {{occupational}} settings, especially in healthcare workers. Wearable motion capture systems are potentially useful to monitor lower back movement in healthcare workers to help avoid the risk factors. In this study, we propose a novel system using sheet stretch sensors and investigate the system validity for estimating lower back movement. Six volunteers (female:male = 1 : 1, mean age: 24. 8 ± 4. 0 years, height 166. 7 ± 5. 6 cm, weight 56. 3 ± 7. 6 kg) participated in test protocols that involved executing seven types of movements. The movements were three uniaxial trunk movements (i. e., trunk flexion-extension, trunk side-bending, and trunk rotation) and four multiaxial trunk movements (i. e., flexion + rotation, flexion + side-bending, side-bending + rotation, and moving around the cranial-caudal axis).
