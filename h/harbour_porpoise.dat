5|$|Porpoises, {{divided into}} seven species, live in all oceans, mostly near the shore. Probably best known is the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> {{which can be}} found across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Harbour</b> <b>{{porpoise}},</b> spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> {{is covered by}} the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and {{are very difficult to}} maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Information on {{the life}} {{functions}} and ecology of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> is still scarce. Only {{a limited number of}} animals are available for research in controlled situations. Satellite tracking allows to gather information on individual movements of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises,</b> hence providing direct insight into the individual lifestyle of a free-ranging animal. Moreover, satellite telemetry is a powerful method for directly identifying the cause-effect relationship between anthropogenic activities and the animal’s behaviour. <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> have been tagged with satellite transmitters already for almost two decades. This document is intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant aspects of telemetry studies in <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> in Dutch waters and also give an overview of the latest technical developments in this field. Based on this information the strategy for further development and use of telemetry in <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> can be shaped...|$|R
25|$|<b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> {{are killed}} with shotguns, and numbers taken must be {{reported}} to the relevant district sheriff. According to statistics, the number of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> shot is very low — from 0 to 10 animals each year.|$|R
40|$|In September 2011, two <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) {{presenting}} extensive traumatic lesions washed ashore in Belgium. Similar lesions, {{with large}} parts of skin and blubber missing, had not been recorded before on <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> in Belgium but were recently observed {{in a number of}} cases in neighbouring countries. We compared the lesions with the mouth and teeth structure of possible predators. The circumstances of the strandings, the observations during the necropsies, and the results of seal skull investigations pointed towards seals, presumably grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), as the prime suspects for having caused the death of both <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises.</b> Although purely aggressive behaviour cannot be completely excluded, predation is considered most likely as part of the skin and blubber tissue of the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> was missing. The grey seal is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of fish and cephalopods, and occasionally even on crustaceans and seabirds, but predation on <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises,</b> or any other marine mammal, had to our knowledge never been described. This finding might shed a new light on the cause of death of some of the other mutilated <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> recently stranded on southern North Sea beaches, and it presents a case of a change in the feeding strategy of a top predator...|$|R
5|$|Porpoises are {{not very}} widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much {{like the rest of}} the odontocetes. Males {{typically}} mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> {{tend to be}} solitary foragers, {{but they}} do {{sometimes}} hunt in packs and herd fish together. [...] Young porpoises need to consume about 7% to 8% of their body weight each day to survive, which is approximately 15 pounds or 7 kilograms of fish. Significant predators of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> include white sharks and killer whales (orcas). Researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland have also discovered that the local bottlenose dolphins attack and kill <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> without eating them due to competition for a decreasing food supply. An alternative {{explanation is that the}} adult dolphins exhibit infanticidal behaviour and mistake the porpoises for juvenile dolphins which they are believed to kill. Also grey seals attack <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> by biting off chucks of fat as a high energy source.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
25|$|There is {{substantial}} incidental catches in fishing operations. Often, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Porpoise</b> (Phocoena phocoena) is killed by incidental by-catch (10, 11, 12). Gillnets pose {{a serious threat}} to the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> as they are extremely susceptible to entanglement. A study by Caswell et al. in the western North Atlantic combined the mean annual rate of increase of the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and population size. It was found that the incidental mortality exceeds critical values and therefore by-catch is a significant threat to the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise.</b> Harbour porpoises become entangled in nets due to their inability to detect the nets before collision. In 2001, 80 harbour porpoises were killed in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia, Canada.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{was written}} to acquire more {{information}} about the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena L.) of Skjálfandi Bay and of whole Iceland. Not much is known about the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> in Iceland because it is very challenging to study them in the wild due to their small size and shy behavior. The baleen whales and bigger toothed whales are very important for tourism and it is also much easier to study them in the wild because of their bigger size and curious behaviour. Therefore, much more is known about them than their smaller cousins, the porpoises. This is the case also at Skjálfandi Bay in Húsavík where whale watching tourism is constantly increasing while professional fishing continues to stay viable. Every year thousands of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> are drown in fishing nets all over their distribution area. The <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> also drown in fishing nets in Iceland and Skjálfandi Bay. This is unfortunate {{but at the same time}} gives a great chance to study these animals and gain more knowledge about the species. The <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> dissected in this study were by-caught in lump sucker (Cyclopterus lumpus) gillnets by professional fishermen at Skjálfandi Bay during spring 2011 and 2012.

40|$|<b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) {{stranding}} {{in large}} numbers around the southern North Sea with fatal, sharp-edged mutilations have spurred controversy among scientists, the fishing industry and conservationists, whose views about the likely cause differ. The recent detection of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) DNA in bite marks on three mutilated <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises,</b> as well as direct observations of grey seal attacks on porpoises, have identified this seal species as a probable cause. Bite mark characteristics were assessed in a retrospective analysis of photographs of dead <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> that stranded between 2003 and 2013 (n = 1081) on the Dutch coastline. There were 271 animals that were sufficiently fresh to allow macroscopic assessment of grey seal-associated wounds with certainty. In 25 % of these, bite and claw marks were identified that {{were consistent with the}} marks found on animals that had tested positive for grey seal DNA. Affected animals were mostly healthy juveniles that had a thick blubber layer and had recently fed. We conclude {{that the majority of the}} mutilated <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> were victims of grey seal attacks and that predation by this species is one of the main causes of death in <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> in The Netherlands. We provide a decision tree that will help in the identification of future cases of grey seal predation on porpoises...|$|R

40|$|DNA was {{analysed}} {{from external}} wounds on 3 dead <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> Phocoena phocoena that were {{stranded in the}} Netherlands. Puncture wounds {{as well as the}} edges of large open wounds were sampled with sterile cotton swabs. With specific primers that target the mtDNA control region of grey seal Halichoerus grypus, a 196 bp DNA fragment was amplified from 4 puncture wounds.

As 8 control swabs from intact skin and the transport bag as well as 6 swabs from open wounds on the same <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> were all negative, contamination with environmental DNA is considered unlikely. The results provide a link between strandings of mutilated <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> and recent observations of grey seals attacking <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises.</b> Ours is the first study to use forensic techniques to identify DNA in bite marks from carcasses recovered from the marine environment.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are two {{representative}} top predator {{species of}} the North Sea ecosystem. The median values of sum of 21 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and sum of 10 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were 23. 1 ìg/g lipid weight (lw) and 0. 33 ìg/g lw in blubber of harbour seals (n = 28) and 12. 4 ìg/g lw and 0. 76 ìg/g lw in blubber of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (n = 35), respectively. For both species, the highest PCB concentrations were observed in adult males indicating bioaccumulation. On the contrary, the highest PBDE concentrations were measured in juveniles, likely due to better-developed metabolic capacities with age in adults. A higher contribution of lower chlorinated and non-persistent congeners, such as CB 52, CB 95, CB 101, and CB 149, together with higher contributions of other PBDE congeners than BDE 47, indicated that <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> are unable to metabolize these compounds. Harbour seals showed a higher ability to metabolize PCBs and PBDEs. <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> and <b>harbour</b> seals present differences in the accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers...|$|R

25|$|Throughout the {{two days}} that the whale was in the Thames waters, there were {{unconfirmed}} sightings of a second whale near the Thames Barrier and in Southend-on-Sea. On 21 January, whale song was reported around the Thames Estuary. The body of a small marine mammal - later confirmed as a porpoise - was discovered upstream at Putney the same day. There {{is no indication that}} this incident had any connection with that of the Thames whale. There had been reports of a <b>Harbour</b> <b>Porpoise</b> in the Thames near Chiswick/Kew on the Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the Thames whale. BDMLR Medics did several watches to no avail; the body of this porpoise washed up nearby on the same day as the Whale rescue.|$|E
40|$|Harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (Phocoena phocoena) are top predators in the North Sea and {{consequently}} accumulate {{a variety of}} pollutants in their tissues. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (HO-PCBs and HO-PBDEs) were measured in serum of wild harbour seals (n = 47) and captive <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> (n = 21). Both species exhibit long life spans {{and do not have}} extreme situations, such as complete fasting during periods of lactation, in their annual cycles. For PCBs, concentrations in adult males were slightly higher than in juveniles and lowest in juvenile females. For PBDEs, juveniles have higher levels than adult males and females, probably as a consequence of lactational transfer. However, differences between these age–gender groups were not statistical significant, indicating that individual variation was limited within each species, even without knowing the feeding status of the animals. Body condition, particularly emaciation, has a major influence on the levels of chlorinated and brominated contaminants in serum. Profiles of PCBs were CB 153 > CB 138 > CB 187 > CB 180 and CB 153 > CB 138 > CB 149 > CB 187 > CB 180 for <b>harbour</b> seals and <b>porpoises</b> respectively. For PBDEs, BDE 47 was the predominant congener followed by BDE 100 and 99 in both species. In harbour seals, concentrations of sum PCBs (median: 39, 200 pg/ml) were more than 200 times higher than levels of sum PBDEs (median: 130 pg/ml) and almost 10 times higher than concentrations of sum HO-PCBs (4350 pg/ml). In <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises,</b> concentrations of sum PCBs (median: 24, 300 pg/ml) were about 20 times higher than concentrations of PBDEs (median: 1300 pg/ml). HO-PCBs were detected in only 4 <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> and this at very low concentrations. Naturally-produced MeO-PBDEs were only found in <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> at concentrations ranging from 120 to 810 pg/ml. HO-PBDEs were not found in any species.
