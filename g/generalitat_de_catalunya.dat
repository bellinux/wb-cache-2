40|$|There is {{significant}} research in robotic navigation using methods based on animal navigation techniques. For example, some work has drawn inspiration from biological {{studies of the}} navigation techniques of the ant species Cataglyphis. The main advantage of such techniques is that they use simple sensors and are also computationally simple, which makes them applicable to inexpensive robots. The Average Landmark Vector (ALV) has been suggested {{as a way to}} model animal navigation techniques. This model assumes that the animal stores an average landmark vector of a place, where landmarks can be (simple) features like edges. The direction to the destination is then the difference of the ALV at the destination and the ALV at the current location. This approach has been investigated in robot homing research, but mainly using artificial landmarks as features. This is a strong limitation, as it requires setting up the environment beforehand. Instead, in our work the goal is to create a simple homing method that can be used without having to rely on artificial landmarks. For this we propose the combination of the ALV homing technique with visual invariant feature detectors.

40|$|Fertility has {{unanimously}} declined {{across the}} entire post-communist /nregion. This study explores the variation in fertility trends over time among these countries and assesses to what degree three explanations are applicable: second demographic transition (SDT), postponement transition (PPT) or reaction to the economic crisis. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} SDT and PPT theoretical tenets, as well as descriptive evidence, the economic context is hypothesized to be linked to two processes of fertility decline conversely. The results show that no one theoretical explanation is sufficient to explain the complex fertility declines {{across the entire}} post-communist region from 1990 to 2003. In some countries, a great part of the decline in fertility occurred before significant postponement of childbearing began, which indicates that the dramatic decline was due to stopping behavior or postponement of higher order births. Postponement of first births, either through PPT or SDT processes, greatly contributed to fertility decline in a small number of countries. Pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses of age-specific birthrates confirm that these two distinct processes are present and show that the economic crisis /nexplanation has explanatory power for declining birth rates. In contrast, logistic regressions show that the likelihood of postponing childbirth increases with improved economic conditions. These results confirm the importance of taking the economic context into account when discussing explanations for fertility decline. More specifically, the results indicate that the severity and duration of economic crisis, or absence thereof, influenced the extent and manner in which fertility declined.

40|$|Grape-derived {{polyphenols}} {{are considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising ingredients for functional foods due to their health-promoting activities. We applied a HPLC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic approach in order to evaluate the impact of a functional food based on grape skin polyphenols on the urinary metabolome of healthy subjects. Thirty-one volunteers participated in two dietary crossover randomized intervention studies: with a single-dose intake (187 mL) and with a 15 -day sustained consumption (twice per day, 187 mL per day in total) of a functional beverage (FB). Postprandial (4 -hour) and 24 -hour urine samples collected after acute consumption and on the last day of sustained FB consumption, respectively, were analysed using an untargeted HPLC-qTOF-MS approach. Multivariate modelling with subsequent application of an S-plot revealed differential mass features related to acute and prolonged consumption of FB. More than half of the mass features were shared between the two types of samples, among which several phase II metabolites of grape-derived polyphenols were identified at confidence level II. Prolonged consumption of FB was specifically reflected in urine metabolome by the presence of first-stage microbial metabolites of flavanols: hydroxyvaleric acid and hydroxyvalerolactone derivatives. Overall, several epicatechin and phenolic acid metabolites both of tissular and microbiota origin were the most representative markers of FB consumption. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies where an untargeted LC-MS metabolomic approach has been applied in nutrition research on a grape-derived FB.

25|$|The {{origins of}} the line date from 1863, when a privately owned railway from Barcelona to the then-separated town of Sarrià was opened. In 1912, Catalan {{engineer}} Carles Emili Montañès created the company Ferrocarriles de Cataluña (FCC) {{in order to take}} control of the line and extend it northwards. After successive extensions, the line reached Terrassa and Sabadell in 1919 and 1922, respectively. In 1977, FCC announced that the whole line was to be closed due to the company's bad economic results. Nevertheless, the Spanish government prevented that from happening by taking control of it. The line was transferred to the Catalan government in 1979, and has been operated by Ferrocarrils de la <b>Generalitat</b> <b>de</b> <b>Catalunya</b> (FGC) ever since. Currently, the most prominent intervention on the line is the extension of the Terrassa and Sabadell branches through the construction of a route underneath the two cities; the former was completed in 2015, whilst the latter will do so in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the subway}} line was due to start in 2008 and the date of {{completion}} {{was estimated to be}} in 2010. The proposed line will link the already existing FGC station Terrassa - Rambla with the Renfe rail line in the city, and will cover a larger portion of the city area, including the Polytechnic University of Catalonia schools located in Terrassa. Construction of the tunnel in Can Roca started in April 2007. <b>Generalitat</b> <b>de</b> <b>Catalunya</b> stated a budget of 178.8 million euros will be available for the construction of the Terrassa Metro, which will be made up of an addition to the Terrassa train stations belonging to the FGC line S1. FGC and Renfe budgets combined sum will sum 321 million euros. Renfe itself is going to build another station in the city: Terrassa Est - Passeig del Camp Parts of the Vallès line operated by FGC are actually already known under the collective name of Metro del Vallès, which will include the Terrassa service and the extension of S2 which will become Sabadell Metro in the almost adjacent municipality of Sabadell, which is already under construction.|$|E
