5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and <b>dipyridamole</b> followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E
25|$|Several radiopharmaceuticals and {{radionuclides}} may be {{used for}} this, each giving different information. In the myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview, GE Healthcare) or 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) are used. Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with adenosine, dobutamine or dipyridamole(Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by regadenoson(Lexiscan), a vasodilator. (Aminophylline can be used to reverse the effects of <b>dipyridamole</b> and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants and anti-platelet {{agents are}} amongst the most {{commonly}} used medications. Anti-platelet agents include aspirin, <b>dipyridamole,</b> ticlopidine, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; the parenteral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used during angioplasty. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are {{the most commonly}} used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on thrombin and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the direct thrombin inhibitors, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as lepirudin). Also under development are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban).|$|E
25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In {{people who have had}} a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and <b>dipyridamole</b> may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{anticoagulants}} such as warfarin {{have been}} the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several {{studies have shown that}} aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75â€“150mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive. Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine. <b>Dipyridamole</b> can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.|$|E
500|$|A {{thallium}} {{stress test}} {{is a form}} of scintigraphy, where the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal Na+/K+ ion exchange pumps. The Tl+ cation binds the K+ pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or <b>dipyridamole</b> induces widening (vasodilation) of normal coronary arteries. This produces coronary steal from areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain [...] "cold". Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas which will benefit from myocardial revascularization. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease.|$|E
50|$|It is {{associated}} with <b>dipyridamole.</b> Hence, <b>dipyridamole</b> is a pharmacological success diagnostically, but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipyridamole</b> {{overdose}} can {{be treated}} with aminophylline which reverses its dilating effect on the blood vessels. Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of <b>dipyridamole</b> overdose. Since <b>dipyridamole</b> is highly protein bound, dialysis {{is not likely to}} be of benefit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipyridamole</b> {{inhibits}} reuptake of adenosine, {{resulting in}} greater extracellular concentrations of adenosine. <b>Dipyridamole</b> also inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase, the enzyme that catalyzes {{the breakdown of}} adenosine.|$|E

Following this, {{the heart}} rate is raised to induce myocardial stress, either by exercise or pharmacologically with adenosine, dobutamine or <b>dipyridamole</b> (aminophylline {{can be used to}} reverse the effects of <b>dipyridamole).</b>|$|E

50|$|Antiplatelet {{medications}} such as aspirin {{are generally}} recommended. They reduce the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on. The initial treatment is aspirin, second-line is clopidogrel (Plavix), third-line is ticlopidine. If TIAs recur after aspirin treatment, {{the combination of}} aspirin and <b>dipyridamole</b> may be recommended. Some people may also be given modified-release <b>dipyridamole</b> or clopidogrel.|$|E
