40|$|At present, most {{aggregation}} routing algorithms for WSNs {{assume that}} aggregation <b>expends</b> are so little {{as to be}} neglected. But with the growing demand for the collection of multimedia data, the aggregation <b>expends</b> are much larger and can’t be neglect. In view of this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive aggregation routing algorithm with the minimal energy consumption (RMEAAT). Firstly, it constructs an -balancing spanning tree {{on the basis of}} SPT and MST as the initial communication path. And then it defines the aggregation benefit with consideration of aggregation <b>expend</b> and transmission <b>expend,</b> and data are adaptively judged whether to aggregate at every node of -balancing spanning tree according to aggregation benefit in the process of transmission. Correspondingly, the initial transmission path is gradually improved in terms of the aggregation judgment. The simulation results show that RMEAAT algorithm has better performance in WSNs with different aggregation <b>expends</b> and fusion degrees. </p...|$|R

50|$|It {{also created}} an {{international}} body {{to monitor the}} Coalition's expenditures from Iraq's oil revenue, the IAMB. The Coalition's authority to <b>expend</b> Iraq's oil revenue was conditional. The Coalition was only authorized to <b>expend</b> those funds {{for the benefit of}} the Iraqi people. Those expenditures were only authorized if they were made in an open and transparent manner. The Coalition was only authorized to <b>expend</b> funds so long as they cooperatived in the IAMB's oversight of those expenditures. The Coalition was charged with the obligation to make those expenditures with meaningful Iraqi input.|$|R

5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was <b>expended</b> and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E
5|$|By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750Japanese {{dead were}} counted {{in and around}} the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American {{casualties}} were 61dead, and 244wounded, including nine dead and 38wounded Seabees. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations. General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been <b>expended</b> during the night, and had Warramunga fire on the native skidway.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} August 1994, after a tender had been won by Scandinavian Rock Group (SRG), a {{collaboration}} between Målselv Anlegg, Nor Entreprenør and Peab. The original contract price was NOK 541 million. An average of 388 man-years were <b>expended</b> during construction, and the work involved the removal of 1.62 million tonnes of rock. There were three excavation points (headings), located at Bryn, Starveien on the Oslo–Lørenskog border, and at Stalsberg, outside Lillestrøm.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen B-25s {{returned}} that afternoon, reportedly claiming 17 hits or near misses. By this time, a {{third of}} the transports were sunk or sinking. As the Beaufighters and B-25s had <b>expended</b> their munitions, some USAAF A-20 Havocs of the 3rd Attack Group joined in. Another five hits were claimed by B-17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes. During the afternoon, further attacks from USAAF B-25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed.|$|E
5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had <b>expended</b> most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E

The first {{was that the}} Carlisle line was very {{circuitous}} compared with the competing Caledonian Railway (CR) route via Beattock, which also served Edinburgh; the route also depended on running over the CR from Gretna Junction to Carlisle, and needed accommodation at Carlisle station. The CR was to prove a formidable competitor for Anglo-Scottish traffic, both passenger and goods, and much energy and money were <b>expended</b> in securing exclusive territory for the G, and in keeping the CR out.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both.

Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E
