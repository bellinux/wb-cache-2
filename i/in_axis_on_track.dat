40|$|AbstractIn the {{machining}} process the dynamic behaviors of machine tools, such as tool vibration, vibration of mechanical structure, and motion error of feed drive systems, influence the machined surface. However, {{the influence of}} dynamic ehaviors onto the machined surface generated by simultaneous five-axis motion has not been investigated up to now. This study focuses {{on the influence of}} motion error of translational and rotary axes onto the machined surface generated by a simultaneous five-axis motion. The geometry used for the tests is the cone frustum, which is typically used for evaluating machining accuracy of five-axis controlled machine tool. A method to simulate the tool motion trajectory and tool orientation for a five-axis machine has been developed based on the modeling of he feed drive systems considering their dynamic characteristic. The machined surface of cone frustum is predicted based on the simulated results. In order to verify the validity of simulation result and the influence of motion error <b>in</b> each <b>axis</b> <b>on</b> the finished surface, cutting tests have been carried out.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the combined effect of solar wind, Poynting-Robertson drag, and the frozen-in interplanetary magnetic {{field on the}} motion of charged dust grains in our solar system. For this reason we derive a secular theory of motion by the means of averaging method and validate it with numerical simulations of the un-averaged equations of motions. The theory predicts that the secular motion of charged particles is mainly affected by the z-component of the solar magnetic axis, or the normal component of the interplanetary magnetic field. The normal component of the interplanetary magnetic field leads to an increase or decrease of semi-major <b>axis</b> depending <b>on</b> its functional form and sign of charge of the dust grain. It is generally accepted that the combined effects of solar wind and photon absorption and re-emmision (Poynting-Robertson drag) lead to a decrease <b>in</b> semi-major <b>axis</b> <b>on</b> secular time scales.

40|$|Viewers exposue to a Virtual Environment (VE) can exhibit {{symptoms}} of motion sickness, such as eyestrain and nausea. This type of motion sickness has {{been referred to}} as cybersickness and is a major ergonomics concern with the use of VEs (Stanney et al., 1998). Literatures show that visual scene movement perceived during navigation in a VE {{plays an important role in}} producing cybersickness. In particular, previous studies have shown that speed of navigation through a VE can significantly affect the levels of cybersickness. The purpose of this research is to study the effects of navigation velocities in different axes on the levels of cybersickness. Due to limitations in resources, the effects of navigation velocities have been studied in only three axes of navigation. Experiment 1 studied the effects of navigating through a VE in different translational axes (i. e., fore-and-aft, lateral, vertical) on cybersickness. Results indicated that navigations in all three translational axes could significantly increase the level of cybersickness as measured by nausea ratings and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores (p< 0. 01). In addition, participants reported significantly lower sickness level with navigation conditions <b>in</b> the fore-and-aft <b>axis</b> (p< 0. 05) and navigating in lateral or vertical axes in the same VE resulted in similar levels of cybersickness. Later experiments would focus on the effects of navigation velocities <b>in</b> the fore-and-aft <b>axis</b> and lateral axis. Experiment 2 studied the effects of navigation velocities ranged from 3 m/s r. m. s. to 150 m/s r. m. s. <b>in</b> fore-and-aft <b>axis</b> <b>on</b> level of cybersickness. Experiment 3 studied the effects of navigation velocities in lateral. In both experiments, a significant main effect of velocities on levels of cybersickness was found (p< 0. 01) and a nonlinear relationship between navigation velocities in fore-and-aft or lateral axis and levels of cybersickness was identified. Since a previous study has shown that exposures to an oscillating VE in different rotating axes result in similar levels of cybersickness, this research studies the effects of navigation velocties in only one rotational axis: the yaw axis. Experiment 4 studied the effects of navigation velocities <b>in</b> yaw <b>axis</b> <b>on</b> levels of cybersickness. A significant main effect of navigation velocities on cybersickness was found (p< 0. 01) and a nonlinear relationship between navigation velocities <b>in</b> yaw <b>axis</b> and levels of cybersickness was identified.

A disadvantage of Pivot plane-casting is that it requires a “clutch” button to disable plane rotation. Without this capability, users would have to always hold the device at a fixed orientation to stabilize the object’s position.

The PTFE films on the mass surfaces can slide between two aluminum electrodes on an inner wall owing to the acceleration <b>in</b> the <b>axis</b> direction. <b>On</b> {{the basis of the}} coupling of triboelectric and electrostatic effects, the potential difference between the two aluminum electrodes is generated in proportion to the mass displacement, which can be used to characterize the acceleration <b>in</b> the <b>axis</b> direction with a detection range from about 13. 0 to 40. 0 m/ s 2 at a sensitivity of 0. 289 V·s 2 /m. With the integration of acceleration sensors in three axes, a self-powered 3 D acceleration sensor is developed for vector acceleration measurement in any direction. The self-powered 3 D acceleration sensor has excellent performance in the stability test, and the output voltages have a little decrease of ∼ 6 % after 4000 cycles.
