25|$|More {{than just}} the band's image was changing, however. In 1988, Pantera {{released}} its first album with Anselmo, titled Power Metal. Power Metal, like Pantera’s previous three albums, was released on Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound. By far the band’s heaviest album at this point, Power Metal was a mix of 1980s hard rock and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song. Complementing the band’s new sonic approach were Anselmo’s harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terrence Lee. After the release of Power Metal, the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound. Referring to the band's spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that “These magic clothes don't play music; we do. Let’s <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and be comfortable — jeans, t-shirt, whatever—and see where it goes.” The band members would later ignore their independent releases, including Power Metal, as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later groove metal sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band’s official website and have become hard-to-find collector’s items.|$|E
500|$|... "Today Is Your Day" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of 3 minutes and 12 seconds. The song is a slow mid-tempo ballad of the country pop genre. Nonetheless, several critics, such as Nicholas Köhler and Ken MacQueen Maclean's, have {{described}} the track to {{be a piece of}} pop music, rather than country music. It commences with a sole piano accompanying Twain's voice, and later progresses to an assortment of banjo, string instruments and other instrumentation. However, the production is maintained as sparse, leaving Twain's vocals at center. The lyrics are written in second person and discuss optimism and personal upliftment. In the bridge she sings, [...] "Brush yourself off no regrets / This is {{as good as it gets}} / Don’t expect more or less / <b>Just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and give it your best", meaning one must be able to disregard dreaming for a better day because [...] "today is all you’ve got". Melinda Newman of HitFix presumed, considering Twain's back story, that Twain wrote [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] as a message for herself.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} month, United Nations human rights experts {{called for an}} end to extrajudicial killings of {{suspected}} drug dealers, about 900 of whom had been executed since the May election, accusing Duterte of [...] "incitement to violence and killing, a crime under international law". In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations. He announced in a news conference on August 19: [...] "You now, United Nations, if you can say one bad thing about me, I can give you 10 [...] I tell you, you are an inutil ("useless" [...] in Filipino street language.). Because if you are really true to your mandate, you could have stopped all these wars and killing [...]" [...] Asked about possible repercussions, he stated: [...] "What is ... repercussions? I don't give a shit to them." [...] He said that the UN had acted against protocol: [...] "You do not <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and give a shitting statement against a country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} Super Bowl XIII {{centered around}} Cowboys linebacker Thomas [...] "Hollywood" [...] Henderson. Henderson caused {{quite a stir}} before the NFC Championship Game by claiming that the Rams had [...] "no class" [...] and the Cowboys would shut them out. His prediction {{turned out to be}} very accurate; the Cowboys did shut them out, aided by Henderson's 68-yard interception return for a touchdown. In the days leading up the Super Bowl, Henderson began talking about the Steelers in the same manner. He predicted another shutout and then made unflattering comments about several Pittsburgh players. He put down the talent and the intelligence of Bradshaw, proclaiming [...] "Bradshaw couldn't spell 'cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'." [...] But the Steelers refused to get into a war of words with Henderson. Greene responded by saying the Steelers didn't need to say they were the best, they would <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on the field and [...] "get the job done.'" ...|$|E
