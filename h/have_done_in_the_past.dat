5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past...</b> I wanted to try and take everything we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|While Via is an {{independent}} federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered {{by the fact that}} it was created by an Order in Council of the Privy Council, and not from legislation passed by Parliament. If Via were enabled by legislation, the company could be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> It is largely for this reason that critics say Via is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.|$|E
25|$|Although Ahmadi Muslims {{believe that}} the Quran is the final message of God for mankind, they also believe that God {{continues}} to communicate with his chosen individuals {{in the same way}} he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> All of God's attributes are eternal. In particular, Ahmadi Muslims believes that Muhammad brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet and the apex of humankind's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come, but they must be completely subordinate to Muhammad and {{will not be able to}} exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. They are also thought of as reflections of Muhammad rather than independently made into Prophets, like the Prophets of antiquity.|$|E

[...] "I feel happier than I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|During {{his meeting}} with fellow GE executives, in which Jack {{is not allowed to}} be with them due to his bedbugs condition, a {{telepresence}} system—a television screen in which the executives can be seen—is placed in Jack's office to witness the meeting. One of the executives (Michael Mulheren) asks Jack if he likes the Cisco Systems equipment, which he does, calling it [...] "the gold standard by which all business technology is judged. Cisco: The Human Network", then after an argument with the executives, they mute him, prompting Jack to say [...] "Did you just mute me!? Did you just use Cisco's cutting edge SureMute™ technology to mute me!?" [...] Some reviewers wondered whether or not 30 Rock continued doing more product placement with the addition of Cisco Systems, as they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> with Snapple, Verizon, and SoyJoy.|$|E

500|$|Burnley {{explained}} that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, {{though it was}} {{toward the end of}} the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E

60|$|And, finally, {{there is}} always the {{prospect}} of a new disease. As yet science has scarcely touched more than the fringe of the probabilities associated with the minute fungi that constitute our zymotic diseases. But the bacilli have no more settled down into their final quiescence than have men; like ourselves, they are adapting themselves to new conditions and acquiring new powers. The plagues of the Middle Ages, for instance, seem to have been begotten of a strange bacillus engendered under conditions that sanitary science, in spite of its panacea of drainage, still admits are imperfectly understood, and for all we know even now we may be quite unwittingly evolving some new and more terrible plague--a plague that will not take ten or twenty or thirty per cent., as plagues <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but the entire hundred.|$|E
6000|$|The year 1925 was {{a lively}} {{year in the}} world's history. Goliah ruled {{the world with a}} strong hand.

When Goliah spoke to politicians (so-called [...] "statesmen"), they obeyed [...] . or died. He dictated universal reforms, dissolved refractory parliaments, and to the great conspiracy that was formed of mutinous money lords and captains of industry he sent his destroying angels. [...] "The time is past for fooling," [...] he told them. [...] "You are anachronisms. You {{stand in the way of}} humanity. To the scrap-heap with you."

Moreover, lest you should fear some trap, on behalf of myself, my successors and councillors, I promise in the Name of God, and by the word of Salah-ed-din, which never yet was broken, that although I trust the merciful God may change her heart so that she enters it of her own will, I will not force her to accept the Faith or to bind herself in any marriage which she does not desire.

[...] Verena spoke these words not out of coquetry, or to make him beg her more for a favour, but because she was thinking, and she wanted to gain a moment. His allusion to Henry Burrage touched her, his belief that she had been in the Park under {{circumstances}} more agreeable than those he proposed. They were not; somehow, she wanted him to know that. To wander there with a companion, slowly stopping, lounging, looking at the animals as she had seen the people do the day before; to sit down in some out-of-the-way part where there were distant views, which she had noticed from her high perch beside Henry Burrage--she had to look down so, it made her feel unduly fine: that was much more to her taste, much more her idea of true enjoyment. It came over her that Mr. Ransom had given up his work to come to her at such an hour; people of his kind, in the morning, were always getting their living, and it was only for Mr. Burrage that it didn't matter, inasmuch as he had no profession. Mr. Ransom simply wanted to give up his whole day. That pressed upon her; she was, as the most good-natured girl in the world, too entirely tender not to feel any sacrifice that was made for her; she had always done everything that people asked. Then, if Olive should make that strange arrangement for her to go to Mrs. Burrage's he would take it as a proof that there was something serious between her and the gentleman of the house, in spite of anything she might say to the contrary; moreover, if she should go she wouldn't be able to receive Mr. Ransom there. Olive would trust her not to, and she must certainly, in future, not disappoint Olive nor keep anything back from her, whatever she might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Besides, she didn't want to do that; she thought it much better not. It was this idea of the episode which was possibly in store for her in New York, and from which her present companion would be so completely excluded, that worked upon her now with a rapid transition, urging her to grant him what he asked, so that in advance she should have made up for what she might not do for him later. But most of all she disliked his thinking she was engaged to some one. She didn't know, it is true, why she should mind it; and indeed, at this moment, our young lady's feelings were not in any way clear to her. She did not see what was the use of letting her acquaintance with Mr. Ransom become much closer (since his interest did really seem personal); and yet she presently asked him why he wanted her to go out with him, and whether there was anything particular he wanted to say to her (there was no one like Verena for making speeches apparently flirtatious, with the best faith and the most innocent intention in the world); as if that would not be precisely a reason to make it well she should get rid of him altogether.|$|E
