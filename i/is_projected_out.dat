40|$|Abstract. Adaptive {{consistency}} is a solving algorithm for constraint networks. Its basic step is variable elimination: {{it takes}} a network as input, and produces an equivalent network with one less variable and one new constraint (the join of the variable bucket). This process is iterated until every variable is eliminated, and then all solutions can be computed without backtracking. A direct, naive implementation of variable elimination may use more space than needed, which renders the algorithm inapplicable in many cases. We present a more sophisticated implementation, based on the projection with memory of constraints. When a variable <b>is</b> <b>projected</b> <b>out</b> from a constraint, we keep the supports which that variable gave to the remaining tuples. Using this data structure, we compute a set of new factorized constraints, equivalent to the new constraint computed as the join of the variable bucket, but using less space {{for a wide range}} of problems. We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of our approach. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Radio astronomical {{observations}} are increasingly contaminated by man-made RF interference (RFI). If these signals are continuously present, then they cannot be removed by the usual techniques of detection and blanking. We have previously proposed a spatial filtering technique, where {{the impact of}} the interferer <b>is</b> <b>projected</b> <b>out</b> from the estimated covariance data. Assuming that the spatial signature of the interferer is time-varying, several such estimates can be combined to recover the missing dimensions. In this paper, we give a detailed performance analysis of this algorithm. It is shown that the spatial filter introduces a small increase in variance of the estimates (because of the loss in information) and that the algorithm is unbiased in case the true spatial signatures of the interferers are known but {{that there may be a}} bias in case the signatures are estimated from the same data. Some of the bias may be removed, and moreover, the bias only affects the auto-correlations, whereas the astronomical information is mostly in the cross-correlations.
