25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> may <b>or</b> may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|R

5000|$|Toffler {{emphasizes}} {{that any of}} the elements of power can be transformed from one to another such that the individual has the Trinity no matter where they started from. For example, force, like a gun/knife (or silent threat of a gun/knife) can be used to obtain Knowledge (information) or Wealth (money). Wealth can be used to obtain Force, like hiring a hit man or buying poison. Wealth can be used to obtain knowledge, like bribing or buying a book. But ultimately, knowledge is emphasized as the most effective (efficient) way to start off. Through knowledge, like the knowledge <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>or</b> other sources on the internet, methods can be found to obtain Force (ex. connections to the [...] "under world") and Wealth (ex. stock tips). A Wealth of Knowledge is now available on the internet and at the disposal of the user through the finger tips. In particular, information related to cybernetics, the modern word for things like casting voodoo spells is freely found on YouTube and other sources. Cybernetics also relates to other fields like numerology and symbology which are powerful tools for obtaining Force and Wealth. Considering Toffler refers to our civilization and economy based upon symbology, or a [...] "symbolic economy", then this is indeed powerful for any individual.|$|E

It maps one process after another, choosing the processor {{that leads to the}} minimum mapping cost. Cost metrics are therefore computed based on a suitable cost function. The cost function we suggest manages the limited processing and interprocessor bandwidth resources and, accordingly, distributing the processing load while minimizing the data flows between processors [8].|$|R
5000|$|Perfidy is {{specifically}} prohibited under the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which states: Article 37. - Prohibition of perfidy1. It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting {{the confidence of}} an adversary to lead him {{to believe that he}} is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:(a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness; (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.Article 38. - Recognized emblems1. It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red lion and sun or of other emblems, signs or signals provided for by the Conventions or by this Protocol. It is also prohibited to misuse deliberately in an armed conflict other internationally recognized protective emblems, signs or signals, including the flag of truce, and the protective emblem of cultural property.2. It is prohibited {{to make use of the}} distinctive emblem of the United Nations, except as authorized by that Organization.Article 39. - Emblems of nationality1. It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.2. It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations.3.

40|$|Operations Research (OR) {{became a}} concept in Sweden {{in the early}} 1950 s. Some of the factors and {{activities}} related {{to the growth of}} OR in Sweden are discussed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> The <b>OR</b> concept used <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> corresponds to the overall approach of SORA, the Swedish Operations Research Association. The development of OR is followed in different organizations, such as SORA, FOA (National Defense Research Institute) and universities and industries in Sweden. It is shown that FOA has played a fundamental role in Swedish OR as both a pioneer and user. SORA has always tried to maintain strong international contacts, which are probably a guarantee for a dynamic OR concept. There is no chair in OR in Sweden and thus no unique view of OR at universities today. Mathematical departments may have a more traditional view of OR, while business economists may use quantitative methods without mentioning the word OR. ...|$|R
