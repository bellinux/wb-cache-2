5|$|It was {{not until}} the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans {{explored}} the remote and <b>hard-to-reach</b> area. Mormon scouts visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for grazing, and settlement.|$|E
5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his <b>hard-to-reach</b> lair. The villain's retreat can be a private island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let Die), a ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)—among other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to <b>hard-to-reach</b> ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack <b>hard-to-reach</b> pigs.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in <b>hard-to-reach</b> spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, the Federal Aviation Authority {{temporarily}} banned flights between Turkey and the United States. This posed a particular problem for Turkish Airlines as a key component of the airline's strategy was to deliver one-stop journeys between the USA and <b>hard-to-reach</b> destinations in Africa, the Middle East, and India. This ban was lifted on July 18, and Turkish Airlines resumed flights to the U.S. on July 19.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Loganair began {{operating}} air ambulances for Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS). In 2005, {{they were}} using three dedicated Britten Norman Islander aircraft, including the accident aircraft, to transport patients from <b>hard-to-reach</b> locations throughout the Scottish Highlands and the surrounding islands, flying roughly 2,000 ambulance flights per year. In early 2005 (before this accident), SAS announced they would be ending their contract with Loganair in 2006 and replacing them with Gama Aviation, which would provide two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters.|$|E
25|$|With {{high speed}} data acquisition, and {{sub-micron}} resolution, OCT is adaptable to perform both inline and off-line. Due {{to the high}} volume of produced pills, an interesting field of application is in the pharmaceutical industry to control the coating of tablets. Fiber-based OCT systems are particularly adaptable to industrial environments. These can access and scan interiors of <b>hard-to-reach</b> spaces, {{and are able to}} operate in hostile environments—whether radioactive, cryogenic, or very hot. Novel optical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies are currently being developed to solve problems in biology and medicine.|$|E
25|$|The narrow valley at the {{southern}} edge of the dry zone was not easily accessible from Central or Upper Burma; the best access to the region was from the south, via the Sittaung. Its <b>hard-to-reach</b> location would shape much of its early history. In the 14th century, the settlement grew to be the principal city of the frontier region, which remained a lawless place. Toungoo's first rebellion of 1317–18 failed but its nominal overlord Pinya had little control over it. Usurpers routinely seized office by assassinating the governor—in 1325, 1344 and 1347—without incurring any reprisals by Pinya. In 1358, Toungoo outright revolted. Pinya's successor Ava (Inwa) regained Toungoo in 1367 but gubernatorial assassinations continued: 1375, 1376 and 1383, at times with Ava's own permission. Only in 1399 could Ava impose tighter control.|$|E
25|$|A Boy and His Blob is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle {{platform}} in which players control {{a young boy}} as he cooperates with a blob-like creature to overcome various obstacles. The boy can feed the blob a variety of jellybeans, which are unlocked as the game progresses and {{vary depending on the}} level, which transforms it into one of fifteen different objects {{that can be used to}} solve puzzles and defeat enemies. These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the <b>hard-to-reach</b> areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jellybean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also hug and scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle. Finding three chests hidden within each main level unlocks additional challenge levels, which rewards bonus developer material such as concept art and storyboards when cleared.|$|E
500|$|There {{is hidden}} content within the game, {{including}} Easter eggs, messages, hidden objects, and weapons. The most well {{known of the}} hidden content are the skulls hidden on every level. The skulls, which can be picked up like a weapon, are located in <b>hard-to-reach</b> places. Many are exclusive to the Legendary mode of difficulty. Once activated, each skull has a specific effect on gameplay. For example, the [...] "Sputnik" [...] skull found on the Quarantine Zone level alters the mass of objects in the game; thus resulting in explosions being able to launch these objects across larger distances. Skull effects can be combined to provide various new levels of difficulty and/or novelty.|$|E
500|$|The {{missions}} {{in the game}} are littered with [...] "intelligence items": briefcases, envelopes, and manila folders containing textual notes which often provide humorous side-notes and helpful hints to the game. The collection of intelligence items is optional. Special power-ups, called [...] "gear" [...] items are also available for collection during the game, such as [...] "fuzzy slippers" [...] that reduce noise made by movement, earplugs that reduce damage from explosions, and a fire extinguisher that protects the player from burn damage. These gear items are sometimes located in <b>hard-to-reach</b> areas. At {{the start of each}} mission, the player can choose which weapons, gadgets and gear to take with them. Some intelligence and gear items cannot be collected on the first playthrough of the game, as the necessary gadgets to reach them are not unlocked until later in the game. If the player wants to collect these items, they have to revisit the mission with the appropriate equipment.|$|E
500|$|Crash Nitro Kart is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. [...] "Item Crates" [...] are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. [...] "Multiplier Crates" [...] are marked with an [...] "X" [...] and are usually found in <b>hard-to-reach</b> spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. [...] "Wumpa Crates" [...] are unmarked and carry [...] "Wumpa Fruit" [...] that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. [...] "Activation Crates" [...] are marked with an exclamation point (!) and don't give the player anything when they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} over six levels called {{attraction}}s. Each attraction {{is divided into}} five acts; the fifth act ends in a boss fight with Robotnik. Like earlier Sonic games, the players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, as well as perform a spin dash {{on the ground to}} gain speed. Power-ups are placed throughout the attractions providing players with rings, shields, and speed shows, among other boons. The partner mechanic offers new actions not seen in earlier Sonic games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character, but this costs the player 10 rings. In addition, players can throw their partner, which can aid in getting to <b>hard-to-reach</b> platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player is given the ability to stop and anchor the computer partner to perform special moves. Using this, the player can [...] "snap up" [...] to a partner on a higher ledge if they are hanging below. They can also anchor the partner and build tension in the tether by moving away from them, then release them to gain a powerful speed boost. The game also employs a [...] "time of day" [...] mechanic; each level changes to a specific time of day (morning, noon, evening, and night), which affects enemy placement and boss difficulty.|$|E
2500|$|Special: A {{mechanism}} {{to get an}} extra game during play is usually called a [...] "special." [...] Typically, some <b>hard-to-reach</b> feature of the game will light the outlanes (the areas to the extreme left and right of the flippers) for special. Since the outlanes always lose the ball, having [...] "special" [...] there makes it worth shooting for them (and is usually the only time, {{if this is the}} case).|$|E
2500|$|For {{nearly all}} of Provincetown's {{recorded}} history, life has revolved around the waterfront − especially the waterfront on its southern shore − which offers a naturally deep harbor with easy and safe boat access, plus natural protection from the wind and waves. [...] An additional element of Provincetown's geography tremendously influenced {{the manner in which}} the town evolved: the town was physically isolated, being at the <b>hard-to-reach</b> tip of a long, narrow peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively—just {{as in the}} [...] "turkey" [...] (which is {{also from}} America), or the [...] "guineafowl" [...] (which {{are not limited to}} Guinea)—"Muscovy" [...] might be simply a generic term for a <b>hard-to-reach</b> and exotic place, in {{reference}} to the singular appearance of these birds. This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much [...] "outlandish" [...] produce was imported at that time (see below).|$|E
2500|$|In February 2005, a {{group of}} {{non-profit}} organizations including CARE, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the International Center for Research on Women protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy {{in a letter to}} US Director of Foreign Assistance Randall L. Tobias. This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge [...] "makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these <b>hard-to-reach</b> groups" [...] and it will [...] "exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{the major}} cities, most {{consumable}} purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held {{daily in the}} more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival. Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or <b>hard-to-reach</b> districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, John Stuart Mill compared the convenience of markets/fairs {{to that of the}} intinerant peddlers: ...|$|E
2500|$|Each level {{contains}} {{a number of}} [...] "score bubbles", initially known as [...] "sponge" [...] in early demonstrations of the game, which may be collected {{in order to increase}} the player's score to beat their own, and other players', high scores. Users may collect larger bubbles known as [...] "prize bubbles" [...] which contain collectable items. Many of these bubbles are hidden or are in <b>hard-to-reach</b> places, and contain items such as new stickers and decorations, or new materials and objects that may be used in the Create mode for the user's own levels. Certain stickers, when placed properly, trigger events. Special clothing and accessories for the player's Sackboy is obtained by completing a level without losing a life, also known as acing a level. In addition to the prize bubbles, collectable keys found in main levels unlock new mini-levels with unique goals, such as skipping a spinning pole or bouncing to grab bubbles. [...] There are also unlockable time trial levels such as bobsleigh racing.|$|E
