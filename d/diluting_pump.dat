5000|$|A {{simple and}} safe {{solution}} is to <b>pump</b> <b>diluted</b> acid mixtures from surface into the well to dissolve the offending material. Once dissolved, permeability should be restored and the reservoir fluids will flow into the well bore, cleaning up {{what is left of}} the damaging material. After initial completion, it is common to use minimal amounts of formic acid to clean up any mud and skin damage. In this situation, the process is loosely referred to as [...] "well stimulation." [...] Oftentimes, special interest groups that oppose oil and gas production refer to the process as [...] "acidization," [...] which is actually the use of acids in high volume and high pressure to stimulate oil production.|$|R
50|$|In the {{reaction}} chambers, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide. Liquid {{from the bottom}} of the chambers is <b>diluted</b> and <b>pumped</b> to the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards in a fine mist. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are absorbed in the liquid and react to form sulfuric acid and nitric oxide. The liberated nitric oxide is sparingly soluble in water and returns to the gas in the chamber where it reacts with oxygen in the air to reform nitrogen dioxide. Some percentage of the nitrogen oxides are sequestered in {{the reaction}} liquor as nitrosylsulfuric acid and as nitric acid, so fresh nitric oxide must be added as the process proceeds. Later versions of chamber plants included a high-temperature Glover tower to recover the nitrogen oxides from the chamber liquor, while concentrating the chamber acid to as much as 78% H2SO4. Exhaust gases from the chambers are scrubbed by passing into a tower through which some of the Glover acid flows over broken tile. Nitrogen oxides are absorbed to form nitrosylsulfuric acid, which is then returned to the Glover tower to reclaim the oxides of nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} numerical {{prediction of}} erosion wear trends in centrifugal <b>pump</b> casing <b>pumping</b> <b>dilute</b> slurries. The casing geometry is considered two-dimensional. Discrete Phase Model (DPM) in FLUENT 6. 1 ® is utilized to obtain dilute slurry flow field through the pump casing employing two-way coupling. Standard k — ε model {{is used for}} turbulence. Effect of several operational parameters viz. pump flow rate, pump speed (RPM), particle diameter and various geometry conditions viz. tongue curvature, slope of the discharge pipe and casing width is studied. Qualitative trends of erosion wear is described for these operational and geometric parameters with an idea to lower the wear rates {{and to make the}} wear pattern along the casing wall as uniform as possible. For example, with increase in pump flow rate, wear rates tends to even out whereas with increased casing width, wear rates are found to decrease...|$|R
40|$|Aluminosilicate scale fouling of heat {{exchanger}} tube is a common, and serious, problem for alumina refineries. One {{of the most}} economical solutions to this issue is to <b>pump</b> <b>dilute</b> sulphuric acid mixted with an appropriate corrosion inhibitor through the pipes to remove the scale. Although some previous inhibitor formulations used in the acid clean have been extremely effective, a greater awareness of environmental issues has prompted inhibitor manufactures to produce green inhibitors. Developing, validating and interpreting {{the results of a}} suitable test protocol that is acceptable for the target alumina industry is challenging. The paper discusses the testing of a variety of formulations in the quest for an inhibitor that is both green and as effective as its predecessor. A test protocol was developed to compare the inhibitors based on the service requirements within an alumina refinery. Linear polarization resistance measurement with a rotating cylinder electrode was found to be an appropriate technique for conducting the evaluations. The results and interpretations of the test are presented in this paper. In addition an associated alkali inhibitor was evaluated using a laboratory based flow loop to simulate plant conditions. Some formulations, although performing poorly as a corrosion inhibitor, exhibited interesting electrochemical behaviour and this is also discussed in this paper. ...|$|R

Commensalism of Proteus vulgaris with Saccharomyces cerevisiae in {{continuous}} culture. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 693 – 696. 1965. —A chemically defined medium was selected which supported {{the growth of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not Proteus vulgaris, in pure culture; however, P. vulgaris grew in mixed culture with the yeast. Steady-state populations of each organism in mixed culture at various dilution rates were enumerated with a Coulter electronic counter. The size differences in the organisms permitted easy resolution. An essential niacinlike factor elaborated by the yeast and required by the bacterium caused a dependence of the bacterium on {{the growth of the}} yeast. At high dilution rates causing wash-out, the bacterial population continued to reflect changes in the numbers of yeast. The numbers of S. cerevisiae were identical in pure culture or in mixed culture; thus, the interaction is a true commensalism. A single addition of niacin or related compound was made to a steady-state mixed culture, and the dependence of the bacterium on the yeast was upset. The numbers of the bacteria rose, causing a decrease in the yeast population, until continued <b>pumping</b> <b>diluted</b> the added niacin and restored the initial steady state...|$|R
40|$|Position Paper {{to develop}} and {{document}} {{a position on the}} selection of the heat removal capability that the MWTF Tank Ventilation Systems will be designed to remove. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide Project W- 236 A, Multi-function Waste Tank Facility, (MWTF) Project File documentation on the selection of the heat removal capability that MWTF Tank Ventilation Systems will be designed to remove. This information is necessary for designing a heat removal system to prevent the thermal limits of the tank structure from being exceeded. It is important to note that this paper is not for defining the tank mixer pump requirements, but is to be only used for defining and defending the normal heat generation rate that the ventilation system and other heat removal systems will be designed to remove. There are three main heat loads in the tanks of which two can be controlled to a certain extent through operational considerations. These two are mixing pump heat and heat of chemical addition. The third heat source is radionuclide content which can only be controlled by what wastes are pumped to the tank and whether it is <b>diluted</b> prior to <b>pumping.</b> Other heat loads such as transfer pumps were considered to be negligible. In addition, chemical addition is considered a transient situation that is rarely performed and will be treated as such...|$|R
30|$|The {{respective}} histone octamers were reconstituted {{as previously}} described (Dyer et al. 2004). Equimolar amounts of individual histones in unfolding buffer B (7  mol/L guanidinium HCl, 20  mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 10  mmol/L DTT) were dialyzed into refolding buffer (2  mol/L NaCl, 10  mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1  mmol/L EDTA, 5  mmol/L 2 -mercaptoethanol), and purified through a Superdex S 200 column. Chromatin samples were assembled using the salt-dialysis method as previously described (Song et al. 2014). The reconstitution reaction mixture with histone octamers and DNA templates in TEN buffers (10  mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1  mmol/L EDTA, 2  mol/L NaCl) were dialyzed for 16  h at 4  °C in TEN buffer, which was continuously <b>diluted</b> by slowly <b>pumping</b> in TE buffer (10  mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1  mmol/L EDTA) {{to a lower}} concentration of NaCl from 2 to 0.6  mol/L. For nucleosomal arrays, samples were collected after final dialysis in measurement HE buffer (10  mmol/L HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1  mmol/L EDTA) for 4  h. For histone H 1 incorporation, an equal molar amount of histone H 1 (relative to mono-nucleosomes) was added before the final dialysis step and further dialyzed in TE buffer with 0.6  mol/L NaCl for 3  h. The stoichiometry of histone octamer binding to the DNA template was determined by EM investigation (Song et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Abstract ： We {{designed}} a new module of Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) with {{fiber optical system}}, which is mainly comprised of a laser diode, optical fibers and a two dimensional (2 D) photodetector. The fiber optical system involved a laser diode (VCSEL, Copax Inc.) with 850 nm wavelength, single mode fiber (Prime Optical Fiber Inc.), half coupler and two fiber collimators. The 2 D photodetector made by silicon PIN photodiode is aligned between the two collimators with 39 ° beams cross angle and all the components were set into a rectangle case, which have coin’s size and can be accommodated by two same set of these components. We added anticoagulant and antiseptic into fresh chicken blood and diluted it with normal saline, and then put the diluted blood into a beaker with a motor in the liquid. The <b>diluted</b> blood was <b>pumped</b> by the motor into an aqueduct which is connected to glass aqueduct, {{and back to the}} beaker to form a circulation system. In the experiments, we evaluate the relationships among the blood cell velocity and diameter of glass tube, temperature variation of blood, and concentrations of blood. By analyzing the results of these experiments, the main factor that affects the precision of velocity measurement is the cross angle of two injected laser beams and the intensity of scattering light. The module constructed by optical fiber light can precisely measure the velocity of blood flow at most 5 % error...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical study is presented of the nonlinear response of a <b>dilute</b> solution being <b>pumped</b> by two laser fields having different frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 {{that are both}} in resonance with electronic transitions of the solute. Experimental results were obtained for the dispersion of the third-order susceptibility ǀχ(3) (ω 2) ǀ 2 for a dilute solution of iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride in chloroform with a fixed intense field (ω 1) resonant with the Qo transition and a tunable weaker field (ω 2) resonant with the Soret transition. The observed Lorentzian dispersion is slightly narrower than the linear absorption spectrum. The theoretical model for the third-order polarization incorporates three levels coupled to two electromagnetic fields and a population reservoir. The equations of motion for the density operator were solved in third order for the appropriate Fourier component. The resulting dispersion curve depends on both total dephasing and population decay rates, thereby demonstrating a general method for the determination of subpicosecond relaxation processes in systems to which the model is applicable. Theoretical fits to the results for iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride imply that the Soret transition is essentially homogeneously broadened with a total dephasing width of 900 ± 200 cm- 1, and {{it is argued that}} the population decay time in this case is approximately 3. 5 fsec. The broad linear absorption spectrum of the Soret band is interpreted as resulting from intramolecular perturbations between the Soret and lower energy excited states of iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride...|$|R

Increasing number in broiler production creates a lot of environment issues. The recent stunning issue that attracts {{the attention of the}} public is about 400 tons of unsolved chicken dung in Selangor that arisen air,water and soil pollution. Fermentation process is the ideal way to solve the problem with win-win situation. Besides producing clean energy with low carbon emission, the sludge obtained after fermentation process is very suitable for landfill as fertilizer. There are 3 same size carboys with 25 liter volume fabricated as fermenters. They are fed-batch with inoculums fermenter,fed-batch without inoculums fermenter and lastly a batch fermenter. After adding 17 liters of sample with 10 % TS w/v for each fermenter,the fermenters are purged with pure nitrogen gas for 30 minutes and later placed inside a fabricated polytank with heating system as water bath to maintain the temperature within 55 degree Celsius which is thermophile anaerobic condition. An additional of 1. 7 liters of sewage sludge (inoculums) is added to the inoculums fermenter. The quantity of gas produced is checked and recorded every days by gas displacement system and the gas composition is checked gas analyzer once a week. For fed-batch fermenters, one sixth of 17 liters is withdrawn once a week,at the same time,same amount of fresh <b>diluted</b> sample is <b>pumped</b> in by using peristaltic pump. By comparing batch with and without inoculums fermentation, applications of inoculums in batch fermentation shorten the lag phase and leads to a shorter fermentation cycle in batch system. By comparing the same thermophile system between batch and fed-batch fermentation process,both of the process give similar result in term of biogas production and methane gas composition during lag phase. However,the biogas production for thermophile fed-batch system keep maintaining at log phase whereas thermophile batch system encounter its’ stationary phase at the day 14 th and death phase at day 40 th. In short, application of inoculums in fermentation accelerates the biogas production and fed-batch fermentation is suitable for commercial purpose as the biogas produced is continuous with low down time...|$|R
