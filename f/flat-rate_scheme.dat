40|$|With the {{advances}} of bandwidth-intensive mobile devices, we see severe congestion problems in wireless data networks. Recently, research emerges {{to solve this}} problem from a pricing point of view. Time dependent pricing has been introduced, and initial investigations have shown its advantages over the conventional time independent pricing. Nevertheless, much is unknown in how a practical and effective time dependent pricing scheme can be designed. In this paper, we explore the design space of time dependent pricing. In particular, we focus on a number of schemes, e. g., the usage-based scheme, the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme,</b> and a mixture of them which we called a cap scheme. Our findings include: 1) the ISP obtains a higher profit with usage-based (or <b>flat-rate)</b> <b>scheme</b> if the capacity is insufficient (or sufficient); 2) the usage-based scheme usually achieves a higher consumer surplus and more efficient traffic utilization than the flat-rate scheme; and 3) the cap scheme is strongly preferred by the ISP to further increase its revenue. We believe our findings provide important insights for ISPs to design effective pricing schemes. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E

However, {{guarantee schemes}} can also reduce insurers’ incentives to conduct appropriate risk management. We investigate stock insurers’ risk-shifting behavior for insurance guarantee schemes under the two different financing alternatives: a flat-rate premium assessment versus a risk-based premium assessment. We identify which guarantee scheme maximizes policyholders ’ welfare, measured by their expected utility. We find that the risk-based insurance guarantee scheme can only mitigate the insurer’s risk-shifting behavior if a substantial premium loading is present. Furthermore, the risk-based guarantee scheme is superior for improving policyholders ’ welfare compared to the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme</b> when the mitigating effect occurs...|$|E

Therefore, shocks may or may not change relevant replacement rates and, thereby may have different effects on unemployment. ...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{traffic to}} homes is surging, {{driven by the}} demand for rich content and the {{proliferation}} of home networks. This creates a huge problem for ISPs since residential customers expect the certainty of a fixed bill while ISPs do not want to upgrade backhaul equipment frequently in the absence of extra revenue streams. We consider simple variants on existing <b>flat-rate</b> <b>schemes</b> that will enable homes to self-select a portion of their peak hours traffic and move it to nonpeak hours to benefit from offered incentives. We present a well-defined formulation of the problem and characterize its computational complexity. We show that a simple fractional algorithm achieves the optimal traffic reallocation and is realizable with small modifications to existing infrastructure. The fractional model also captures the reality that homes may be willing to move a fraction of their delay-tolerant traffic in response to appropriate incentives. Using trace-driven simulations based on well-accepted utility models and actual backbone traffic from a large ISP, we demonstrate that our incentive scheme can substantially lower peak congestion while still satisfying the increased demand of home networks...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we analyse how three {{scenarios}} involving {{different levels}} of harmonisation of common agricultural policy (CAP) decoupled payments in the EU affect the distribution of farm income across regions and farm types. We use the farm type extension of the common agricultural policy impact (CAPRI) model, which captures farm heterogeneity across the EU. The first scenario (NUTS 1) assumes uniform per-hectare payments at the NUTS 1 level. The second scenario (MS-CONV) equalises the per-hectare rates inside each Member State (MS) and partially harmonises the single payment scheme (SPS) across MS {{in line with the}} 2011 Commission proposal. The third scenario simulates a uniform per-hectare payment at the EU level. Depending on the implementation of the SPS, the NUTS 1 flat rate induces a substantial redistribution of payments across farm types and NUTS 2 regions, particularly in regions that apply the historical SPS. The MS-CONV and EU <b>flat-rate</b> <b>schemes</b> have more significant impacts at the EU-wide level. In the EU- 15, almost all farms lose payments from MS-CONV and EU-wide flat rates, whereas in the EU- 10, almost all farm types gain from these scenarios. Our conservative estimates indicate that the flat-rate payments could redistribute up to € 8. 5 billion. Lower land rental costs partially offset the losses of farm income in the EU- 15 from payment redistribution. Land rents drop for all flat-rate scenarios across most sectors and farm sizes in the EU- 15. In the less productive new MS, the landowners’ rental income is largely unaffected by the introduction of the flat rate. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the benefit from using the Internet and its applications available online. With a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme</b> that is common under the broadband access (FTTH, DSL, CATV, etc.) in Japan, it is difficult to measure consumer surplus with traditional economic methodology as a usage-sensitive market price does not exist. Internet users can enjoy online applications as many/much as they want. In this situation, subscribing and using the Internet means that Internet users buy a bundled commodity at a certain fixed price for the services they want, which are included in the package. In this study, we tried to unbundle the composite commodity (i. e. Internet service as a whole) into the applications available on the Internet and measured the Willingness to Pay (WTP) for those applications. We applied a Stated Preference (SP) method for analyzing data and used a Random Parameter Logit Model for estimating WTP for each of such applications as emailing, web browsing and content downloading. The estimated WTP for availability of e-mail and web browsing over PC are ¥ 3, 567 and ¥ 8, 598 respectively while average broadband access service costs approximately ¥ 4, 000 in Japan...|$|E
30|$|We {{investigate}} whether consumers accept dynamic pricing using a choice experiment. We estimate {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) {{from the results of}} a choice experiment. Then, we analyze the most preferable dynamic pricing rules for consumers. There are several previous studies related to our study. Borenstein (2006) estimated the number of consumers who take risk aversion action. Risk aversion implies the avoidance of an electric pricing rule with high volatility, such as real-time pricing (RTP). Borenstein (2006) found that 77 % of consumers investigated were risk averse. In addition, Borenstein (2013) found that consumers tend to remain in the flat-rate fee scheme. He also used field experiment data to analyze what characteristics of consumers lead them to switch to other electricity rates. As a result, he noted that low-income consumers tend to switch from a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme</b> to a dynamic pricing scheme. A dynamic pricing scheme has the possibility to improve several energy problems, such as energy conservation and mitigation of CO 2 emissions. But, an effective dynamic pricing scheme requires the joining of several types of consumers (Kurakawa et al. 2016). Therefore, understanding consumer preferences for each dynamic pricing rule is important in actually implementing a dynamic pricing scheme. Furthermore, some researchers have noted that consumers may prefer an energy management system that automatically adjusts electricity usage to a dynamic pricing scheme. Therefore, we add the analysis of the preference for direct load control (DLC), which does not require the risky price change of electricity to consumers; instead, it automatically adjusts the rate based on use.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a price-based resource allocation scheme for Differentiated Service (DiffServ) data networks. The DiffServ framework was proposed to provide multiple QoS classes over IP networks. Since the provider supports multiple service classes, {{we need a}} differentiated pricing scheme, as supposed to the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme</b> employed by the Internet service providers of today. Charging efficiently is a big issue. The utility of a client correlates {{to the amount of}} bandwidth allocated. One difficulty we face is that determining the appropriate amount of bandwidth to provision and allocate is problematic due to different time scales, multiple QoS classes and the unpredictable nature of users. To approach this problem, we designed a pricing strategy for Admission Control and bandwidth assignment. Despite the variety of existing pricing strategies, the common theme is that the appropriate pricing policy rewards users for behaving in ways to improve the overall utilization and performance of the network. Among existing schemes, we chose auction because it is scalable, and efficiently and fairly shares resources. Our pricing model takes the system's availability and each customer's requirements as inputs and outputs the set of clients who are admitted into the network and their allocated resource. Each client proposes a desired bandwidth and a price {{that they are willing to}} pay for it. The service provider collects this information and produces parameters for each class of service they provide. This information is used to decide which customers to admit. We proposed an optimal solution to the problem of maximizing the provider's revenue for the special case where there is only one bottleneck link in the network. Then for the generalized network, we resort to a simple but effective heuristic method. We validate both the optimal solution and the heuristic algorithm with simulations driven by a real traffic scenario. Finally, we allow customers to bid on the duration for which the service is needed. Then we study the performance of those heuristic algorithms in this new setting and propose possible improvements.

40|$|Recent revelations that ISPs {{selectively}} manipulate P 2 P traffic {{have sparked}} much public discussion. Underlying {{this issue is}} the misalignment of interests between consumers on one hand who desire bulk transfers at flat rates, and ISPs {{on the other hand}} who are bound by budget and capacity constraints. Our thesis is that much of the tension can be alleviated by time-shifting traffic away from peak hours taking advantage of its Delay Tolerant (DT) nature. We propose two solutions for doing this. The first one offers incentives to end-users to shift their DT traffic and yet be compatible with <b>flat-rate</b> charging <b>schemes.</b> The second one posits augmenting the network with additional storage in the form of Internet Post Offices which can let ISPs perform store-and forward relaying of such DT traffic. 1...|$|R

A cost-based {{approach}} to multicast pricing, based on accurate characterization of multicast scalability, will facilitate the efficient and equitable resource allocation between traffic types. Through the quantification of link usage, this paper establishes a multicast scaling relationship: {{the cost of}} a multicast distribution tree varies at the 0. 8 power of the multicast group size. This result is validated with both real and generated networks, and is robust across topological styles and network sizes. Since multicast cost can be accurately predicted given the membership size, there is strong motivation to price multicast according to membership size. Furthermore, a price ceiling should be set to account for the effect of tree saturation. This tariff structure is superior to either a purely membership-based or a <b>flat-rate</b> pricing <b>scheme,</b> since it reflects the actual tree cost at all group membership levels.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P COMP 2016 Zhangxvi, 115 pages :color illustrationsAs the {{popularity}} of smart mobile devices, together with bandwidth-intensive applications, the data traffic for wireless data networks has grown tremendously {{in the past few}} years. This poses challenges for the network operators to improve or even maintain network quality of the system. People are concerned whether such demand increase can be fulfilled by simple infrastructure expansion. On the other hand, it also brings huge financial burden to the Internet service providers (ISPs) since supporting such demand-supply gap requires large investments. The pricing of data traffic and other services is central to the core challenges of network management, growth sustainability and monetization supports. The smart data pricing has great potential to tackle the issue of surging demand for network operators and may also bring great benefit to consumers, Internet service providers, and content providers. In this thesis, we analyze the two main pricing proposals in smart data pricing, i. e., time dependent pricing (short for TDP) and sponsored data plan (short for SDP). We try to understand the rationale behind the two pricing models, as well as their impacts to the wireless data market, in particular, who will benefit and who will be hurt from these schemes. We also propose and analyze a new pricing proposal, time dependent sponsoring (short for TDS), that combines the advantages of TDP and SDP. First, we focus on the time dependent pricing, which is a promising pricing method to relieve the congestion caused by the surging traffic demand. TDP captures the time-variation characteristic of demand by charging users dynamically over time and has the potential to even out time-of-the-day fluctuations in bandwidth consumption. We explore the design space of TDP. In particular, we focus on a number of schemes, e. g., the usage-based scheme, the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme,</b> and a mixture of them which called a cap scheme. Our main findings include: 1) the ISP obtains a higher profit with usage-based (or <b>flat-rate)</b> <b>scheme</b> if the capacity is insufficient (or sufficient); 2) the usage-based scheme usually achieves a higher consumer surplus and more efficient traffic utilization than the flat-rate scheme; and 3) the cap scheme is strongly preferred by the ISP to further increase its revenue. Second, we analyze the sponsored data plan, a recent pricing proposal, i. e., when accessing contents from a particular content provider (short for CP), end users do not need to pay for that volume of traffic consumed, but the CP will sponsor for this data consumption. We build a two-class service model to analyze the consumers' traffic demand under the sponsored data plan with consideration of QoS. We use a two-stage Stackelberg game to characterize the interaction between CPs and the ISP and reveal a number of important findings. Our conclusions are: 1) When the ISP's capacity is sufficient, the sponsored data plan benefits consumers and CPs in the short run, but the ISP does not have incentives to further improve its service in the long run. 2) When ISP's capacity is insufficient,the ISP and end users may achieve a win-win trade, while the ISP and CPs always compete for the revenue. 3) The sponsored data plan may enlarge the unbalance in revenue distribution between different CPs; CPs with higher unit income and poorer technology support are more likely to prefer the sponsored data plan. Third, we propose and study one new smart data pricing scheme, time dependent sponsoring, i. e.,content providers can decide when and how much to sponsor their traffic. The main novelty of TDS is its potential to improve Internet resource utilization by migrating data traffic from peak times to valley times. We formulate a Stackelberg game model to study the interactions between the ISP, CPs and users, and derive the optimal sponsoring fractions over different times under TDS. In particular, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm to solve a non-convex optimization in sponsoring decisions. We find that: 1) TDS improves the CPs' bandwidth utilization,CPs' profit and consumers' welfare for slightly patient strategic users; but may result in controversial effects for highly patient strategic users, and 2) when CPs provide different subsidizations to different groups, the bandwidth usage can be improved significantly and so are CPs' profit and consumers' welfare, and 3) well designed TDS reduces the waste of capacity and thus improves social welfare and ISP's profit, compared with TDP.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a quantitative policy impact analysis of alternative policy and macroeconomic assumptions {{in the agricultural}} farming sector. Three scenarios are considered: direct payment scenario, macroeconomic environment scenario and WTO scenario. We apply the CAPRI-Farm model, an extension of CAPRI which disaggregates the standard Nuts 2 regional resolution of the supply models in CAPRI further to farm type models, capturing farm heterogeneity in terms of farm specialization and farm size across all EU regions and MS. The advantage of the CAPRI-Farm model compared to other similar models is that it represents comprehensively all major farm types in the EU and it links farm level behaviour with output and input market price responses. The direct payment scenario assumes equalisation of decoupled payments - a regional <b>flat-rate</b> <b>scheme</b> - at the Nuts 1, MS and EU levels. According to simulation results, the value of re-distributed payments vary strongly between the three flat-rate systems. The value of payments reallocated between farms in the EU increases from 9 % (3. 7 billion Eur) of the total CAP budget in the Nuts 1 scenario to 19 % (8. 2 billion Eur) in the EU flat-rate scenario. Particularly negatively affected are large- and medium-sized farms and dairies, mixed crops and livestock, general field and mixed cropping, olives, cereals and oilseeds and permanent crops. Small farms {{tend to be less}} affected. However, sheep, goats and grazing, the residual farm category and mixed livestock farms realise higher premiums and incomes. The study shows relatively minor allocative market responses and thus small price effects for all three scenarios. The WTO scenario aims to quantify the impact of trade liberalization on farming sector. More precisely, the scenario considers the impact of the proposal made by the chair of the WTO's agriculture negotiations, Ambassador Crawford Falconer. The simulation results show that tariff reduction increases consumer welfare in the EU by 8. 5 billion Eur, whereas agricultural income decreases by 6. 8 billion Eur (- 3 %), mainly driven by losses realised in the animal sector. The analyses show sizable impacts on farm income for different farm types. Generally, farm types specialised in livestock production lose the most. The largest negative income effects were observed for cattle, dairying, rearing and fattening, dairy, mixed crops and livestock; and sheep and goat farms. The macroeconomic environment scenario simulates the farm-level effects of a hypothetical economic recovery scenario that may lead to higher GDP growth and higher oil prices. Two shocks are assumed: an increase in the crude oil price by 50 % and an annual world GDP growth rate increase by 1 % relative to the baseline level. The results indicate that a higher GDP growth causes stronger price and market effects than does the increase in the oil price. With the oil price shock, farmers are affected by two opposing effects: an increase in production costs and an increase in revenues. In most cases, increasing costs dominate such that the overall farm income declines. The effect of higher GDP on income across farm types is generally positive due to the rising demand for agricultural products, which generates an increase in the prices of agricultural commodities. Farmers react to the new macro environment with adjustments of their production leading to an increase in arable land and intensification of crop and animal production activities. Further, a tendency to substitute grassland for arable land can be observed. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, ISPs in mature {{residential}} broadband {{markets have}} been moving away from <b>flat-rate</b> pricing <b>schemes</b> to ones that involve usage limits (or ?data caps). These changes {{have led to a}} lively debate about the merits of data capping. While previous work has studied the theoretical benefits of data capped pricing models, there is relatively little work that provides insights into exactly how to design data capped tariffs, and their impact on the parties involved, i. e., ISPs and their broadband subscribers. In this paper, we formulate the problem of selecting optimal data capped tariffs based on a simple, extensible model of ISP costs and revenues, and a novel model that captures how users evaluate a set of offered tariffs. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and describe two heuristics that provide reasonable solutions. We also describe an approximation algorithm that yields bounded solutions. We apply this framework on a novel broadband usage dataset collected from real-users and examine the cost-benefit impact of data capping for various cost regimes that reflect different regional markets around the world. We find that in highly competitive markets with relatively high traffic costs, data capping can indeed help the ISP to manage costs while resulting in a more equitable per unit data cost across the users. However, in the absence of meaningful competition or when traffic costs are low, data capping largely benefits the ISP and is to the detriment of subscribers. Copyright 2014 ACM...|$|R
40|$|The two key {{resources}} in an IP Telephony network are the Internet Telephony Gateways (ITGs) and the IP network. These resources must be effectively managed to simultaneously provide good QoS to calls and maximize network resource utilization. This paper presents two main contributions. First, we design a call admission policy based on congestion sensitive pricing. As the load increases, this policy preferentially admits users who place a higher value on making a call while simultaneously maintaining a high utilization of network resources. We derive the function mapping congestion to {{price for the}} admission policy that maximizes revenue. Second, we design a call redirection policy to select the best ITG to serve the call. The policy balances load to improve network efficiency and incorporates QoS sensitivity to improve call quality. Simulation results show the following: (i) Congestion pricing based admission control lowers call blocking probability, increases provider revenue, and improves economic efficiency over a static <b>flat-rate</b> admission control <b>scheme.</b> (ii) Congestion sensitivity in the redirection policy balances load across all the ITGs while QoS sensitivity improves call audio quality. (iii) Incorporating price sensitivity in the redirection policy improves the economic efficiency, i. e., ensures that users who pay more get higher QoS.

40|$|One of {{the major}} areas for {{research}} and investment related to the Internet is the provision of quality of service (QoS). We remain confident that in the not-to-distance future, QoS will be introduced not only in private networks but in the whole Internet. QoS will bring some new features into the Internet market: (1) vertical product differentiation with BE and QoS, (2) usage-sensitive pricing with metering. In this dissertation, the equilibrium outcomes are analyzed when two rural Internet Access Providers (IAPs) interact with several business and technical strategies such as technology (BE or QoS), pricing <b>scheme</b> (<b>flat-rate</b> pricing or two-part tariff), interconnection (transit or peering) and investment in network capacity. To determine the equilibria, we construct a duopoly game model based on Cournot theory. We calibrate this model to data found in real markets. In this model, we study ten cases {{with a combination of}} strategic choices of two IAPs. We use two demand functions: one based on uniform distribution and the other based on empirical distribution which comes from the U. S. General Accounting Office (U. S. GAO) survey for Internet usage. We use a two-stage RNG (Random Number Generator) simulation and a linear regression for the latter. If we consider IAPs with the BE and the flat rate pricing as the current Internet, the equilibrium points of each case in this model suggest a progressive market equilibrium path to the future Internet market. Based on the equilibrium analysis of the game model, we conclude that (1) {QoS, two-part tariff, transit/peering} or {QoS, flat-rate pricing, peering} will be a plausible situation in the future Internet access market, (2) network capacity will still be an important strategy to determine market equilibrium in the future {{as well as in the}} current, (3) BE will take a considerable market share in the QoS Internet, and (4) peering arrangements in the QoS Internet will provide a higher social welfare than transit.

40|$|In the {{standard}} economic account of consumer behavior {{the cost of}} a purchase {{takes the form of a}} reduction in future utility when expenditures that otherwise could have been made are forgone. The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a “double-entry” mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paying and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling. Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to {{the standard}} prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong —that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paying beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, <b>flat-rate</b> pricing <b>schemes</b> such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases. We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60 % of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29 % of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates). The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or service should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.
