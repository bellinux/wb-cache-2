500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up in his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E
2500|$|I couldn't {{approach}} {{black people}} with the truth because they like lies. They live lies... At one time I felt that white people were to blame for everything, but then I found {{out that they were}} just puppets and pawns of some greater force, which has been using them... Some force is having a good time [...] and looking, enjoying itself up in a reserved seat, wondering, [...] "I wonder when they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> up."... I used to be interested in saving black people. Now, they're expendable as far as I'm concerned.|$|E

2500|$|Guthrie was a {{prolific}} writer, penning {{thousands of pages}} of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood. During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia, a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious Martha Graham Dance School, where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece Folksay. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg, Folksay included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads for the dance. Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, Bound for Glory, was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943. It is vividly told in the artist's down-home dialect, with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller. Library Journal complained about the [...] "too careful reproduction of illiterate speech." [...] But Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in the New York Times, paid the author a fine tribute: [...] "Someday people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> {{up to the fact that}} Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world." [...] A film adaptation of Bound for Glory was released in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|He {{became the}} villain [...] "Lord Steven Regal" [...] on the June 12 episode of Saturday Night, {{claiming}} descent from William the Conqueror and Sir William began serving as his manager. At times arrogantly charming in this persona, {{one of his}} memorable statements to a post-match interviewer was, [...] "Do you know what my New Year's resolution is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be? <b>To</b> <b>wake</b> up {{a half an hour}} earlier so I can hate you more." [...] His first major win after the character change was against Marcus Alexander Bagwell on the June 16 episode of Clash of the Champions. Regal was scheduled to face Bagwell's partner 2 Cold Scorpio on the August 18 episode of Clash of the Champions, but he was replaced by Bobby Eaton as Regal himself substituted for a World Tag Team Championship defense in place of the injured Brian Pillman alongside Steve Austin against Arn Anderson and Paul Roma. Austin would lose the titles.|$|R

25|$|Learning that he {{is stuck}} working the store all day, as his boss went to Vermont, Dante convinces his friends to play hockey on the store roof, though the game is short; twelve minutes in, an enraged {{customer}} shoots their only ball off the roof and into a sewer. Reopening the store, Dante finds another of his ex-girlfriends has died and her wake is today. Randal talks him into closing the store again and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wake.</b> The visit is catastrophic, with Randal and Dante running out to escape in their car.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine sex {{differences}} in subjective symptoms of fatigue (SSF) in high school and college students by considering the relationship between subjective feeling of fatigue and life habits. A questionnaire on SSF (54 items), dealing with subjective feeling of fatigue and life habits (frequency of exercise, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep, <b>waking</b> in the morning and physical condition) was administered to 5622 healthy students aged 15 - 20 yr, and data of 5335 properly completed questionnaires was analyzed. The following was determined : 1) Sex differences were confirmed in most SSF items. SSF complaints for females was generally higher than that of males. 2) The relationship between SSF and the age was low in both sexes. 3) Subjective feeling of fatigue is somewhat related to SSF. 4) The <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep last night influence on SSF was different in both sexes and related largely to the next day SSF in males. 5) Waking this morning and today's physical condition are related to SSF in both sexes. 6) In males, the influence of exercise habits on SSF regarding drowsiness is relatively large...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Guadet and Salles {{were both}} taken, ere long; they died by the Guillotine in Bourdeaux; drums beating to drown their voice. Valady also is caught, and guillotined.

[...] Also well-known is Café del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by José Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers.|$|R

As he turned over in this torture, he sighed, and recognized a movement of the De Beriot concerto which Helena had played for her last lesson.

She was wrong, he was hasty; and he felt her blue eyes looking intently at him.|$|R
