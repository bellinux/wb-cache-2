5|$|The {{ship was}} built by the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. Her keel was laid down on 30 January 1899, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 7 November 1901 {{in the presence of}} the King and Queen of Italy, government officials, and the whole Italian Mediterranean squadron. Fitting out work lasted for the next four years, and she was completed on 1 September 1905. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> primarily because of non-delivery of material, particularly the heavy armor. After she entered active service, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The Squadron was usually only activated for seven months of the year in peacetime, which was occupied with training maneuvers, and the rest of the year the ships were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Benedetto Brin, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. Benedetto Brin remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time the fourth Regina Elena-class ship was completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six.|$|E

500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International.

However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati.

The three The Itchy & Scratchy cartoons that are shown {{at the beginning of}} the episode as Krusty is hosting his show are all parodies of films released in 2010: the first one, titled The Cat's Speech, is a parody of The King's Speech; the second one, titled The Social Petwork, parodies The Social Network in that the storyline is partially explained through the use of screens containing nothing but text; and the final one, titled Black and Blue Swan, references Black Swan. [...] After the three cartoons are shown, Krusty points out that [...] "It’s like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> to animate them that we look dated and hacky!" [...] This is a reference to the long time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons—hence why cultural references on the show can often be seen as dated. Pop culture allusions at the television museum include a brief appearance by the main characters of the animated series King of the Hill as cardboard cutouts being taken down in a process similar to the opening of the show, an exhibit devoted to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, and the showing of one of Homer's favorite television shows, Fatso Flanagan, which is a knockoff of the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E
