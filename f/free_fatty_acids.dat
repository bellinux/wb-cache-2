5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene {{are unique to}} sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBoth galactolipase {{activity}} and <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content {{are much higher}} in chloroplasts of chilling-sensitive plants (bean, broad bean, tomato and maize) than in those of chilling-resistant ones (spinach, pea and lettuce). However, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol content in chloroplasts of these two groups of plants relates neither to <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> levels nor galactolipase activity. It seems that chloroplast galactolipase {{activity and}} <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> level may be useful biochemical parameters discriminating chilling-sensitive from chilling-resistant plants...|$|R
40|$|Forty-two {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} {{acute myocardial infarction}} were studied over the first 3 days of their illness {{to determine the effect}} of oral or intravenous calorie intake on the circulating <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> values. Repeated sampling in 9 patients showed that <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> levels above 1000 mumol/l were seldom found beyond the first 10 hours after admission. Oral calories, chiefly in the form of carbohydrate, reduced <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> by an average of 145 mumol/l for each intake of 90 or more calories (378 kF) on the first day. Oral calories (especially carbohydrate) should be considered as possible antilipolytic therapy if it be held desirable to reduce circulating <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations in patients with acute mycoardial infarction...|$|R
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the {{fatty acids}} are {{broken down by}} beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{concentrations}} in plasma measured after in vivo heparinisation are often overestimated because of ex vivo lipolysis of variable degrees. A new method {{has been developed}} using immediate extraction of blood which obviates this and shows that the true rise in plasma <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration after heparin in ambulant ward patients and in patients with acute myocardial infarction is less than previously reported. The small rise in plasma <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration after heparin is unlikely to have adverse metabolic effects in most patients during acute myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|Metoprolol and acebutolol, two {{supposedly}} cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, {{were tested}} in 11 healthy men against propranolol, a non-selective drug, for their effect on plasma <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations before and after insulin. The fasting concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> were significantly reduced after acebutolol and propranolol, and their return to normal after insulin was delayed. Metoprolol had no significant effect on <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> levels either before or after insulin. Although both selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs {{should be expected to}} delay the return of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> values to normal after insulin, in contrast to propranolol and acebutolol, metoprolol had no such effect. This suggests that metoprolol may not be as effective as the other two drugs in controlling lipid metabolism during long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists...|$|R

Foaming properties of milk in terms of initial foam volume, foam stability and visual appearance of foam as functions of <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration were determined. Surface tension of milk showed a negative relationship with its <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and foaming properties.

25|$|The chylomicrons {{circulate}} {{throughout the}} body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal. Lipoprotein lipase on the endothelial {{surfaces of the}} capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but {{to a lesser extent}} also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> glycerol and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes, but the glycerol and chylomicron remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The <b>free</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway.
