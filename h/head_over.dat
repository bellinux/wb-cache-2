5|$|On 16 December 2016, EVA Air Flight BR 15 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16726, Delivered January 2016) from Los Angeles International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport {{narrowly}} missed hitting Mount Wilson and Air Canada Flight 788. The LAX {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to turn left instead of right to <b>head</b> <b>over</b> the ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA {{was forced to}} climb to 6000 feet. Air Canada Flight 788, also from LAX was taking the same route BR 15 was. Air Canada Flight 788 was forced to climb to over 10000 feet to avoid hitting BR 15. It took almost two minutes for the pilot to make a 180 degree turn to go southbound. An investigation is being held and EVA Air also did not comment.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{came to a}} <b>head</b> <b>over</b> the {{approach}} {{to the war in}} France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckinghamwho had by now been created Duke of Gloucesterand Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel.|$|E

5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the <b>head)</b> <b>over</b> those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2009–10 season, Jovanovski missed ten {{games with}} a lower-body injury in November and December 2009. Shortly after {{returning}} to the Coyotes lineup, he was suspended for two games by the NHL for a hit {{to the head of}} Minnesota Wild forward Andrew Ebbett with his forearm on December 7, 2009. The following month, he received another two-game suspension for elbowing New York Islanders rookie forward John Tavares in the <b>head.</b> <b>Over</b> 66 games during the season, he notched 10 goals and 34 points. He was overtaken as the team's top-scoring defenceman by Keith Yandle, who had scored 41 points. While the season was marked with an uncertain future for the Coyotes from a business perspective, as the franchise had filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 and was taken over by the NHL, the team performed well and recorded their best season in history. With 50 wins and 107 points (a 28-point improval from the previous season), they finished with the third best record in the West and came within five points of a Pacific Division and Conference title, trailing only the San Jose Sharks. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, the Coyotes were eliminated in seven games. Jovanovski had one goal and no assists in his first NHL playoffs since 2004.|$|E
5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the crest became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox's <b>head</b> <b>over</b> the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's <b>head</b> <b>over</b> his shoulders to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E

The bishops opposed this and, after a struggle lasting for several years, obtained a final settlement of this and other questions, a settlement, in the main, satisfactory to the bishops.|$|E

St. John was on Our Lady's left. He was dressed in white vestments and resembled a bishop, with a small mitre. He appeared to be preaching and he held an open book in his left hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects {{to be built}} into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated; the console can even tell them what color to emit. Costumes in <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> Heels (a musical by Lolita Snipes), The Wiz, and The Winter's Tale are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.|$|E
25|$|Knight Lore, an {{isometric}} {{sequel to}} Sabre Wulf, helped {{to establish the}} conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula would be repeated in later games like <b>Head</b> <b>Over</b> Heels, and Monster Max. These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually {{a series of small}} rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese action-adventure games like The Legend of Zelda to create games like Land Stalker and Light Crusader. While these games are more generally classified as action adventures, they are also isometric platformers and an evolution of earlier conventions in the genre. This influence would later travel to Europe with Adeline Software's sprawling epic Little Big Adventure, which blended RPG, adventure, and isometric platforming elements.|$|E
