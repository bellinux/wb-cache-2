The part of the town on the left bank is regarded as Brest proper, while the part on the right is known as Recouvrance. There are also extensive suburbs to the east of the town. The hillsides are in some places so steep that the ascent from the lower to the upper town has to be effected by flights of steps and the second or third storey of one house is often on a level with the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> of the next.|$|E
500|$|In 1885–87 the {{partnership}} designed Abbeystead House for the 4th Earl of Sefton in North Lancashire. Hubbard describes this as [...] "the finest of Douglas's Elizabethan houses, {{and one of}} the largest which he ever designed". During this time additions were made to Jodrell Hall in Cheshire and Halkyn Castle in Flintshire. In 1885 the Castle Hotel at Conwy, Caernarfonshire, was remodelled, and in 1887–88 a strongroom was added to Hawarden Castle, followed by a porch in 1890. During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate, and these included houses and cottages, such as Eccleston Hill, and Eccleston Ferry House, and farms such as Saighton Lane Farm. In 1890–91 an obelisk was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall. The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was Brocksford Hall (1893) in Derbyshire. This was a country house in Elizabethan style using diapered brick and stone dressings with a clock tower. In Chester city centre, 38Bridge Street (1897) is a timber-framed shop that incorporates a section of Chester Rows and contains heavily decorated carving. From 1892 {{the partnership}} designed houses and cottages in Port Sunlight for Lever Brothers. Also in the village they designed the Dell Bridge (1894), and the school (1894–96), which is now called the Lyceum. In1896 Douglas designed a house for himself, Walmoor Hill in Dee Banks, Chester, in Elizabethan style. Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings {{on the east side of}} StWerburgh Street in the centre of Chester. At its south end, on the corner of Eastgate Street, is a bank whose <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> is built in stone, and behind this leading up StWerburgh Street, the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> consists of shop fronts. Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic, which are covered in highly ornamented timber-framing. On the first floor is a series of oriel windows, the second floor is jettied, and at the top are eleven gables. Pevsner considers that this range of buildings is [...] "Douglas at his best (though also at his showiest)". Hubbard expresses the opinion that [...] "in this work, the city's half-timber revival reached its very apogee".|$|E
2500|$|The Chinesischer Turm ("Chinese Tower") is a [...] 25-metre-high wooden structure, first {{constructed}} in 1789 to 1790, from a design by the Mannheimer military architect Joseph Frey (1758–1819). It was modelled on the [...] "Great Pagoda" [...] in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. The Pagoda, {{twice as high}} as the tower, was supposed to resemble a porcelain pagoda in the gardens of a Chinese emperor. The Munich tower has five storeys: the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> roof has a diameter of 19 m, the topmost storey of 6 m.|$|E

Built of brick, it was four storeys high and three windows wide, although the fourth storey may have been a later addition. The windows had segmental gauged arches and the jambs were probably dressed with red brick, while within the openings were slightly recessed boxframes. There was no bandcourse between the second and third storeys, but above the latter was a moulded brick cornice returned at either end.

A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll's predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. No where was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} has the classical {{shape of a}} palace, with a style referring to Palladian architecture, popular in Europe in the late 19th century. Decoration motifs and compositional schemes are borrowed from Andrea Palladio's treaty [...] "I Quattro Libri dell'Architectura" [...] (cf. Andrea Palladio's Villa Capra [...] "La Rotonda" [...] in Vicenza). The villa has a rectangular footprint, consisting of a front part and a lower <b>ground</b> floor <b>storey</b> on the east, with a terrace overlooking the garden. An avant-corps stands on the front street, with a porch up the stairs, topped with a tympanum.|$|R
50|$|The mall complex {{consists}} of three buildings connected by bridges. Building A is a two-storey building, hosting most of the shops around a large central hall. Building B hosts the cinema and some smaller shops, its <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> is occupied by a car park and five smaller shops opening to the street. Building C is a three storey car park.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} of the palace which are attributable to Giulio and alien to Palladio’s vocabulary are clearly recognisable: the four-column atrium is substantially identical {{with that of the}} Palazzo Te (even if Palladio indubitably modified its vaulting system); also Giulian are the windows and the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> facades onto the street and courtyard, while Palladio must have been defined the upper storey trabeation and capitals.|$|E
5000|$|The gentle {{curvature}} of the facade is contained by a double storey of paired pilasters [...] The columns of the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> are pressed into the wall rather than projecting as a spatial entity like the entrance portico at Santa Maria della Pace. Other elements such as pediments and mouldings are allowed to project between the columns to create spatial tensions which are reminiscent of Florentine Mannerism.|$|E

50|$|The {{pattern of}} {{openings}} on the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> {{section of the}} facade is not as regular as that described above. There are narrow windows with fanlights located in the central bays {{of two of the}} three facade segments. The opening in the remaining segment is a door with fanlight. Those windows that flank them are generally divided in two by a rendered mullion, as are the ones above, but the arches to their fanlights are flatter. All windows on this level have four transoms. The segment adjoining the AMP Building to the north-west of this property {{is the only one that}} conforms generally to the pattern suggested in the overall facade design. A large opening pierces the northern side of the central segment, while a smaller, shuttered opening fills the final bay on the south-eastern end adjoining the Walter Reid Community Arts Centre. A narrow canvas canopy has been installed above the widest opening, which currently serves as entry to the entertainment/nightclub premises. A series of Tuscan-style pilasters decorate the engaged piers to the <b>ground</b> <b>storey.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} walls to the <b>ground</b> <b>storey</b> are rendered. The French {{doors and windows}} {{on each of these}} facades have basket arch-shaped heads. A simply moulded impost marks the springing point of these arches. The ground floor walls are approximately 40 centimetres thick. On the north facade a triangular, rendered support has been put in place. An early in-ground, brick-lined water tank is situated under the edge of the verandah on the southern facade.|$|E
