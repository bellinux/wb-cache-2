Four distinctive characteristics of “new realism” are detected in three subsequent public debates, culminating in the <b>genre</b> <b>of</b> “hyper-realism”, of which the immensely successful and recently murdered politician Pim Fortuyn proved to be the consummate champion. ...|$|R

5|$|As <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> popular literature, {{science fiction}} and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
