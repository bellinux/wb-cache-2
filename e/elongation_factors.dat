25|$|Among the {{proteins}} recruited to polymerase are <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> thus called because they stimulate transcription elongation. There are different classes of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors.</b> Some factors {{can increase the}} overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin. One of the <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> P-TEFb, is particularly important. P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit 5'-capping enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.|$|E
25|$|RTA has rRNA N-glycosylase {{activity}} {{that is responsible for}} the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5’-AGUACGAGAGGA-3’, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{elongation}} phase starts once {{assembly of}} the elongation complex has been completed, and progresses until a termination sequence is encountered. The post-initiation movement of RNA polymerase is the target of another class of important regulatory mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional activator Tat affects elongation rather than initiation during its regulation of HIV transcription. In fact, many eukaryotic genes are regulated by releasing a block to transcription elongation called promoter-proximal pausing. Pausing can influence chromatin structure at promoters to facilitate gene activity and lead to rapid or synchronous transcriptional responses when cells are exposed to an activation signal. Pausing {{is associated with the}} binding of two negative <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> DSIF (SPT4/SPT5) and NELF, to the elongation complex. Other factors can also influence the stability and duration of the paused polymerase. Pause release is triggered by the recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase.|$|E
40|$|Incubation of electrophoretically pure {{samples of}} the Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomal protein L 7 /L 12 {{together}} with <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> Tu leads to the hydrolysis of GTP. Addition of <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> Ts stimulates this reaction. <b>Elongation</b> <b>factor</b> G cannot replace <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> Tu for the ribosome-free GTPase reaction dependent on L 7 /L 12. The data suggest that <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> Tu and the protein L 7 /L 12 interact directly at the ribosomal A site...|$|R

50|$|EF-G or <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> G (historically {{known as}} translocase) is a prokaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> and a GTPase {{responsible}} for catalyzing the coordinated movement of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome.|$|R
25|$|Transcription {{elongation}} is not {{a smooth}} ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription. In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time before resuming transcription. In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5). The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.|$|E
500|$|The mature mRNA {{finds its}} way to a ribosome, where it gets translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the {{processes}} of transcription and translation may be linked together without clear separation. [...] In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. [...] The ribosome reads the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine−uracil−guanine), or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribosome binding site. [...] Complexes of initiation factors and <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> bring aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into the ribosome-mRNA complex, matching the codon in the mRNA to the anti-codon on the tRNA. Each tRNA bears the appropriate amino acid residue to add to the polypeptide chain being synthesised. [...] As the amino acids get linked into the growing peptide chain, the chain begins folding into the correct conformation. Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, or UAG triplet.|$|E
2500|$|Leader {{peptidase}} A (LepA) is an {{elongation factor}} that {{is thought to}} back-translocate on the ribosome during the translation of RNA to proteins in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes that have maintained functioning mitochondria. [...] There are three primary <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> (EF-G, EF-Tu, EF-Ts) that {{are known to be}} the main contributors to facilitate elongation during protein synthesis; due to LepA's now acknowledged proofreading function in translation, scientists are now lobbying to have LepA renamed as EF-4 (elongation factor 4).|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to its conventional role during protein synthesis, eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A is involved in other cellular processes. Several regions of interaction between eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A and the translational apparatus or the cytoskeleton have been identified, yet {{the roles of the}} different post-translational modifications of eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A are completely unknown. One amino acid modification, which so far has only been found in eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A, consists of ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol attached to two glutamate residues that are conserved between mammals and plants. We now report that ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol is also present in eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, indicating that this unique protein modification is of ancient origin. In addition, using RNA-mediated gene silencing against enzymes of the Kennedy pathway, we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine is a direct precursor of the ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol moiety. Down-regulation of the expression of ethanolamine kinase and ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase results in inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in T. brucei procyclic forms and, concomitantly, in a block in glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to procyclins and ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol modification of eukaryotic <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> 1 A...|$|R

To choose a strong and constitutive promoter to track fluorescently labelled bifidobacteria in environments under anaerobic conditions. Results The <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> P (EF-P) promoter from Bifidobacterium longum CECT 4551 produced the highest emission of fluorescence signal and was therefore able to produce the highest gene expression of the promoters studied.

2500|$|<b>Elongation</b> <b>factors</b> {{are part}} of the {{mechanism}} that synthesizes new proteins through translation in the ribosome. [...] Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) carry the individual amino acids that become integrated into a protein sequence, and have an anticodon for the specific amino acid that they are charged with. [...] Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information that encodes the primary structure of a protein, and contains codons that code for each amino acid. [...] The ribosome creates the protein chain by following the mRNA code and integrating the amino acid of an aminoacyl-tRNA (also known as a charged tRNA) to the growing polypeptide chain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{covalent}} {{attachment to}} the tRNA 3’ end is catalyzed by enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. [...] During protein synthesis, tRNAs with attached amino acids are delivered to the ribosome by proteins called <b>elongation</b> <b>factors,</b> which aid in association of the tRNA with the ribosome, synthesis of the new polypeptide and translocation (movement) of the ribosome along the mRNA. [...] If the tRNA's anticodon matches the mRNA, another tRNA already bound to the ribosome transfers the growing polypeptide chain from its 3’ end to the amino acid attached to the 3’ end of the newly delivered tRNA, a reaction catalyzed by the ribosome.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of {{terminating}} transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex. Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last. [...] The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of <b>elongation</b> <b>factors</b> and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex. [...] The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' exonuclease degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.|$|E

In addition, purified <b>elongation</b> <b>factor</b> Tu binds tightly to DNase I in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2.
