Unit2 has been administered by Exelon Nuclear since 2003, when Exelon Nuclear's parent company, Exelon, bought out the remaining shares of AmerGen, inheriting FirstEnergy's maintenance contract.

2500|$|Initially, efforts {{focused on}} the cleanup and {{decontamination}} of the site, especially the <b>defueling</b> of the damaged reactor. Starting in 1985, almost [...] of radioactive fuel {{were removed from the}} site. The first major phase of the cleanup was completed in 1990, when workers finished shipping [...] of radioactive wreckage to Idaho for storage at the Department of Energy's National Engineering Laboratory. However, the contaminated cooling water that leaked into the containment building had seeped into the building's concrete, leaving the radioactive residue too impractical to remove. In 1988, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that, although it was possible to further decontaminate the Unit2 site, the remaining radioactivity had been sufficiently contained as to pose no threat to public health and safety. Accordingly, further cleanup efforts were deferred to allow for decay of the radiation levels and {{to take advantage of the}} potential economic benefits of retiring both Unit1 and Unit2 together.|$|E

5000|$|On 10 August 1985, {{control rods}} were {{incorrectly}} {{removed from a}} Victor class submarine during <b>defueling</b> at Chazma Bay naval yard outside Vladivostok, resulting in an explosion, the [...] "release of large amounts of radioactivity", and ten deaths. In addition to this Victor, five other submarines have damaged cores preventing their <b>defueling</b> by normal methods.|$|E
5000|$|Before SRP can begin, the vessel's {{nuclear fuel}} must be removed, and <b>defueling</b> usually coincides with decommissioning. Until the fuel is removed, the vessel is {{referred}} to as [...] "USS Name," [...] but afterward the [...] "USS" [...] is dropped and it {{is referred to}} as [...] "ex-Name." [...] <b>Defueling</b> of submarines is carried out at only five ship repair facilities on the West Coast, and the hulls are then towed to PSNS.

50|$|The 14-year-old {{submarine}} was deactivated in 1997, and {{was laid}} up from July 1999 at the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk awaiting decommissioning.

5000|$|The biggest American {{military}} {{nuclear facility}} {{for the production}} of weapons-grade plutonium was Hanford site (in the State of Washington), now <b>defueled,</b> but in a slow and problematic process of decontamination, decommissioning, and demolition. There is [...] "the canyon" [...] a giant structure for the chemical extraction of plutonium with the PUREX process. There are also many big containers and underground tanks with a solution of water, hydrocarbons and uranium-plutonium-neptunium-cesium-strontium (all highly radioactive). With all reactors now <b>defueled,</b> some were put in SAFSTOR (with their cooling towers demolished). Several reactors have been declared National Historic Landmarks.|$|R

50|$|Commander Spelker became Miamis {{eleventh}} {{and final}} commanding officer after assuming command from Commander Meyer at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

50|$|Newport News Shipbuilding will {{deactivate}} and de-fuel the ship, {{which will}} then be formally decommissioned once all nuclear fuel has been removed. The process started at the downtown piers in Newport News in order to set the conditions required in the propulsion plant for fuel removal.

Newport News employees will continue the <b>defueling</b> process in the dry dock.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of nuclear {{facilities}} have been decommissioned so far. The number of decommissioned nuclear reactors out of the List of nuclear reactors is small. As of 2016, 150 nuclear reactors were shut-off, in several early and intermediate stages (cold shut-down, <b>defueling,</b> SAFSTOR, internal demolition), but only 17 {{have been taken to}} fully [...] "greenfield status".

50|$|After a {{few days}} of LPCI, decay heat will have {{sufficiently}} abated to the point that <b>defueling</b> of the reactor is able to commence with a degree of caution. Following <b>defueling,</b> LPCI can be shut down. A long period of physical repairs will be necessary to repair the broken recirculation loop; overhaul the ECCS; diesel pumps; and diesel generators; drain the drywell; fully inspect all reactor systems, bring non-conformal systems up to spec, replace old and worn parts, etc. At the same time, different personnel from the licensee working {{hand in hand with the}} NRC will evaluate what the immediate cause of the break was; search for what event led to the immediate cause of the break (the root causes of the accident); and then to analyze the root causes and take corrective actions based on the root causes and immediate causes discovered. This is followed by a period to generally reflect and post-mortem the accident, discuss what procedures worked, what procedures didn't, and if it all happened again, what could have been done better, and what could be done to ensure it doesn't happen again; and to record lessons learned to propagate them to other BWR licensees. When this is accomplished, the reactor can be refueled, resume operations, and begin producing power once more.|$|E

25|$|Long term fuel salt storage - If the {{fluoride}} fuel salts {{are stored}} in solid form over many decades, radiation can cause the release of corrosive fluorine gas and uranium hexafluoride.
