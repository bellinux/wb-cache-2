During long periods of idle time, the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> a sequence of regularly timed [...] "mark" [...] pulses (1) by group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices {{to turn on the}} teleprinter; this series of pulse was generating series of Erasure/Delete and also initializing the receiver state to the Letters shift mode, however the first pulse could be lost, so this power on procedure could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null {{in the middle of a}} message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the opposite the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.|$|E
5000|$|An ectopic {{pacemaker}} or ectopic {{focus is}} an excitable group of cells that causes a premature heart beat outside the normally functioning SA node of the heart. It {{is thus a}} cardiac pacemaker that is ectopic, producing an ectopic beat. Acute occurrence is usually non-life-threatening, but chronic occurrence can progress into tachycardia, bradycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In a normal heart beat rhythm, the SA node usually suppresses the ectopic pacemaker activity due to the higher <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> of the SA node. However, in the instance of either a malfunctioning SA node or an ectopic focus bearing an intrinsic rate superior to SA node rate, ectopic pacemaker activity may take over the natural heart rhythm. [...] This phenomenon (an intrinsically slower pacemaker activity being unmasked by failure of faster pacemaker tissue 'upstream') is called an escape rhythm, the lower rhythm having escaped from {{the dominance of the}} upper rhythm. As a rule, premature ectopic beats (i.e. with a shorter than the prevailing preceding R-R' interval) indicate increased myocyte or conducting tissue excitability, whereas late ectopic beats (i.e. with a prolonged preceding R-R' interval) indicate proximal pacemaker or conduction failure with an escape 'ectopic' beat.|$|E

40|$|Thesis is {{concerned}} with the source and characteristics of variability in the discharge of impulses by neurons. The neuron in which variability was studied is the eccentric cell in the compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. In Part I a theory is presented which accounts for the variability in the response of an eccentric cell to light. The main idea of this theory is that the source of randomness in the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> is 2 ̆ 2 noise 2 ̆ 2 in the generator potential. Another essential aspect of the theory is the view that the process which codes the generator potential into the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> may be treated as a linear filter. These ideas lead directly to Fourier analysis of the fluctuations of the generator potential and fluctuations of the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate.</b> Experimental verification of theoretical predictions was obtained by measurement of the fluctuations and calculation of their variance spectrum. The variance spectrum (or power spectrum) of the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> is shown to be the filtered variance spectrum of the generator potential. Another verification of the theory is the finding that in many cells the signal-to-noise ratio is constant for responses to sinusoidally modulated light, at all modulation frequencies. Inhibition from neighboring eccentric cells will {{have an effect on the}} variability of firing of a given eccentric cell. The effects of inhibition are discussed in Part II.

For example, a mixture ratio of a bipropellant could be adjusted such that it may not have the optimal specific impulse, but will result in fuel tanks of equal size.

40|$|Both {{mammals and}} birds use the {{interaural}} time difference (ITD) for {{localization of sound}} in the horizontal plane. They may localize either real or phantom sound sources, when the signal consists of a narrow frequency band. This ambiguity does not occur with broadband signals. A plot of <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> or amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials against ITDs (ITD curve) consists of peaks and troughs. In the external nucleus (ICX) of the owl's inferior colliculus, ITD curves show multiple peaks when the signal is narrow-band, such as tones. Of these peaks, one occurs at ITDi, which is independent of frequency, and others at ITDi +/- T, where T is the tonal period. The ITD curve of the same neuron shows a large peak (main peak) at ITDi and no or small peaks (side peaks) at ITD +/- T, when the signal is broadband. ITD curves for postsynaptic potentials indicate that ICX neurons integrate the results of binaural cross-correlation in different frequency bands.

The aim {{was to determine whether}} failure of spike propagation occurred at any of the three major axonal branch points in the path to their cuneate target neurones, and whether propagation failure may contribute, along with synaptic transmission failures, to limitations in transmission security observed for the cuneate synaptic relay. No evidence for propagation failure was found at the two major axonal branch points prior to the cuneate nucleus, namely, the T-junction at the dorsal root ganglion, and the major branch point near the cord entry point, even for the highest <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> (∼ 400 <b>impulses</b> s− 1) at which these fibres could be driven. However, at the highest <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> there was evidence at the central, intra-cuneate recording site of switching between two states in the terminal axonal spike configuration. This appears to reflect a sporadic propagation failure into one of the terminal branches of the sensory axon. In conclusion, it appears that central impulse propagation over group II sensory axons occurs with complete security through branch points within the dorsal root ganglion and at the spinal cord entry zone. However, at high rates of afferent drive, terminal axonal propagation failure may contribute to the observed decline in transmission security within the cuneate synaptic relay...|$|R

One is the decline in CMRglc(ox) during anesthesia and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and another, the inverse relationship between the resting-state CMRglc(ox) and the transient following input from the thalamus. The recent establishment of a quantitative relationship between synaptic and action potential activity {{on the one hand}} and CMRglc(ox) on the other allows neural network models of such activity to probe for possible mechanistic explanations of these phenomena. We have carried out such investigations using cortical models consisting of networks of modules with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, each receiving excitatory inputs from outside the network in addition to intermodular connections. Modules may be taken as regions of cortical interest, the inputs from outside the network as arising from the thalamus, and the intermodular connections as long associational fibers. The model shows that the impulse frequency of different modules can differ from each other by less than 10 %, consistent with the relatively uniform CMRglc(ox) observed across different regions of cortex. The model also shows that, if correlations of the average <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> between different modules decreases, there is a concomitant decrease in the average <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> in the modules, consistent with the observed drop in CMRglc(ox) in NREM sleep and under anesthesia.

The PBIS’s stand-alone design with a sufficiently large data memory facilitates continuous long-term monitoring for low-scale bedload measurements. The design concept of PBIS {{is based on}} a hypothesis that particle collision energy on the PBIS plate increases with hydraulic energy and particle size. Thus, particle size can be differentiated by the number of impulses registered in four different threshold channels. The feasibility of PBIS was evaluated by developing a calibration model based on laboratory flume experiments. Two different types of experiment were conducted: (1) individual particle experiment and (2) multi-size particle experiment. The individual particle experiment results indicated that hydraulic condition affected the mode of bedload particle motion. The mean <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> per particle is expressed as a function of bed shear stress, t. In addition, the represented particle sieve size range of each threshold channel was determined based on the fractional impulse ratio per unit mass by the particle sieve size class. The multi-size particle experiment results indicated that multi-particle interaction and signal interference from consecutive particle impacts on the PBIS plate caused a notable reduction of registered impulses in channel 1 from approximately 700 impulses per minute. The bias between individual and multi-size particle experiment results caused by multi-particle effects were expressed by a function of bed shear stress, t, and mean <b>impulse</b> <b>rate,</b> Rj, in each PBIS threshold channel. The adjusted calibration coefficient is a coefficient of linear equation to convert registered impulses to mass of particles retained in the represented particle sieve size classes of each channel. The adjusted calibration coefficients for each channel were estimated using the two-dimensional response surface methodology (RSM) with two variables, bed shear stress, t, and mean <b>impulse</b> <b>rate,</b> Rj. This study was enough to show the feasibility of the multi-channel PBIS to obtain mass and particle-size distribution of small gravel bedload. However, many issues associated with the calibration model are still remained beyond this study. First of all, the calibration model was developed based on laboratory flume experiments conducted in a well-controlled small-scale environments. Second, from the comparison between the actual and the estimated values, it was found that two inherent error factors which can cause overestimate are imbedded in the linear calibration model of PBIS. Third, two major assumptions for the model, an equal fractional bedload particle-size distribution and the law of large number, always have a distinction from chaotic phenomena in natural bedload transport. Because of that, the most preferential request will be the field application...|$|E

In addition, similar imposed movements were performed while {{the subject was}} instructed to remain relaxed. Movement amplitudes were about 5 deg and the speed 10 – 30 deg s− 1. Joint movements were translated to movements of a cursor on a monitor to provide visual feedback. Individual spindle afferents modulated their activity {{over a number of}} targets, i. e. were broadly tuned, during these aiming movements. The preferred direction for a spindle afferent was the same during both passive and active movements, indicating that the fusimotor effects associated with active contractions had little or no effect on the direction of tuning. The direction of tuning of individual spindle afferents could be predicted from the biomechanically inferred length changes of the parent muscle. Thus spindle afferents responded as stretch receptors, i. e. <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> increased with lengthening and decreased with shortening, in active as well as passive movements. Spindles from muscles, which continuously counteracted gravity exhibited a stretch response and directional tuning during the phase of movement alone whereas their position sensitivity was poor. In contrast, spindle afferents from the muscles that had no or minimal antigravity role were directionally tuned during both the dynamic and the static phase of the aiming task and their position sensitivity was substantially higher. In spite of the limited data base from three extensor muscles it could be demonstrated that wrist joint position was remarkably well encoded in the ensemble muscle spindle data.

Many methods have been proposed for solving reward models, but no method has proven itself to be applicable over all system classes and sizes.

40|$|During {{dexterous}} manipulation {{with the}} fingertips, forces {{are applied to}} objects' surfaces. To achieve grasp stability, these forces must be appropriate given {{the properties of the}} objects and the skin of the fingertips, {{and the nature of the}} task. It has been demonstrated that tactile sensors in the fingertips provide crucial information about both object properties and mechanical events critical for the control of fingertip forces, while in certain tasks vision may also contribute to predictions of required fingertip actions. This thesis focuses on two specific aspects of the sensory control of manipulation: (i) how individual fingers are controlled for grasp stability when people restrain objects subjected to unpredictable forces tangential to the grasped surfaces, and (ii) how tactile sensors in the fingertips encode direction of fingertip forces and shape of surfaces contacted by the fingertips. When restraining objects with two fingers, subjects adjust the fingertip forces to the local friction at each digit-object interface for grasp stability. This is accomplished primarily by partitioning the tangential force between the digits in a way that reflects the local friction whereas the normal forces at the involved digits are scaled by the average friction and the total load. The neural control mechanisms in this task rely on tactile information pertaining to both the friction at each digit-object interface and the development of tangential load. Moreover, these mechanisms controlled the force application at individual digits while at the same time integrating sensory inputs from all digits involved in the task. Microneurographical recordings in awake humans shows that most SA-I, SA-II and FA-I sensors in the distal phalanx are excited when forces similar to those observed during actual manipulation are applied to the fingertip. Moreover, the direction of the fingertip force influences the <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> in most afferents and their responses are broadly tuned to a preferred direction. The preferred direction varies among the afferents and, accordingly, ensembles of afferents can encode the direction of fingertip forces. The local curvature of the object in contact with the fingertip also influenced the <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> in most afferents, providing a curvature contrast signals within the afferent populations. Marked interactions were observed in the afferents' responses to object curvature and force direction. Similar findings were obtained for the onset latency in individual afferents. Accordingly, for ensembles of afferents, the order by which individual afferents initially discharge to fingertip events effectively represents parameters of fingertip stimulation. This neural code probably represents the fastest possible code for transmission of parameters of fingertip stimuli to the CNS...|$|R

Numerical results show that the worst case symbol error probability varies linearly with γ when the noise is purely impulsive, and almost linearly with β when the noise is non-Gaussian over a large range of values of β.

However, {{the first stage of}} integration should be endowed with specific properties that enable efficient handling of the incoming information. In elasmobranches, the afferent nerve originating from the ampullae of Lorenzini targets specific neurons located at the Dorsal Octavolateral Nucleus (DON), the first stage of integration in the electroreception system. Using intracellular recordings in an isolated brainstem preparation from the shark we analyze the properties of this afferent pathway. We found that stimulating the afferent nerve activates a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory synapses mediated by AMPA-like and GABAA receptors, respectively. The excitatory synapses that are extremely efficient in activating the postsynaptic neurons display unusual voltage dependence, enabling them to operate as a current source. The inhibitory input is powerful enough to completely eliminate the excitatory action of the afferent nerve but is ineffective regarding other excitatory inputs. These observations {{can be explained by the}} location and efficiency of the synapses. We conclude that the afferent nerve provides powerful and reliable excitatory input as well as a feed-forward inhibitory input, which is partially presynaptic in origin.

We focused on the American bullfrog [...] a common animal subject for vestibular sensory research. Our principal experimental method was to apply precise, sinusoidal microrotational stimuli to an anesthetized animal subject, to record the resulting responses in an individual vestibular nerve fiber from the intact ear, and to use intracellular dye to trace the fiber and thus identify the vestibular sensor that gave rise to it. In this way, we were able to identify specific micromotional sensitivities and to associate those sensitivities definitely with specific sensors. Furthermore, by recording from nerve fibers after they leave the intact inner-ear cavity, we were able to achieve these identifications without interrupting the delicate micromechanics of the inner ear. We were especially concerned with the relative roles of the utricle and the anterior semicircular canal in the sensing of microrotational motion of the head about horizontal axes, and with the role of gravity in mediating that sensing process in the utricle.

40|$|ABSTRACT The light {{response}} of the lateral eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, increases at night, while the frequency of spontaneous discrete fluctuations of its photoreceptor membrane potential (quantum bumps) decreases. These changes are controlled by a circadian clock in the brain, which transmits activity to the eye via efferent optic nerve fibers (Barlow, R. B., S. J. Bolanski, and M. L Brachman. 1977. Science. 197 : 86 - 89). Here we report the results of experiments in which we recorded from single Liraulus photoeceptors in vivo for several days and studied in detail changes in their physiological and membrane properties. We found that: (a) The shape of (voltage) quantum bumps changes with the time of day. At night, spontaneous bumps and bumps evoked by dim light are prolonged. The return of the membrane potential to its resting level is delayed, but the rise time of the bump is unaffected. On average, the area under a bump is 2. 4 times greater at night than during the day. (b) The rate of spontaneous bumps decreases at night by roughly a factor of 3, but their amplitude distribution remains unchanged. (c) The resting potential and resistance of the photoreceptor membrane do not change with the time of day. (d) the relationship between injected current and <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> of the second order neuron, the eccentric cell, also remains unchanged with the time of day.

Using the number of geophone impulses and total transported bedload mass for each measurement to derive a calibration function results in a strong linear relation for the Fischbach, whereas there is only a poor linear calibration relation for the Ruetz measurements. Instead, using geophone <b>impulse</b> <b>rates</b> and bedload transport rates indicates that two power law relations best represent the Fischbach data, depending on transport intensity; for lower transport intensities, the same power law relation is also in reasonable agreement with the Ruetz data. These results are compared with data and findings from other field sites and flume studies. We further show that the observed coarsening of the grain size distribution with increasing bedload flux can be qualitatively reproduced from the geophone signal, when using the impulse counts along with amplitude information. Finally, we discuss implausible geophone impulse counts that were recorded during periods with smaller discharges without any bedload transport, and that are likely caused by vehicle movement very near to the measuring sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{previously}} {{reported that a}} gelatin sheet incorporating {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} accelerated sternal healing after bilateral internal thoracic artery removal in normal and diabetic rats. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of this therapeutic modality on sternal healing in a large-animal model before performing a clinical trial. MethodsAfter median sternotomy and bilateral internal thoracic artery removal in a pedicled fashion, 14 beagle dogs received either a gelatin sheet incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor (100 μg per sheet) on the posterior table of the sternum (FGF group, n = 7) or did not receive a gelatin sheet (control, n = 7). We compared sternal healing 4 weeks after surgical intervention between the groups. ResultsScintigraphic images obtained by using technetium 99 methylene diphosphonate bone scanning were assessed visually, and the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> was quantified 30 and 60 minutes after injection of technetium 99 methylene diphosphonate to evaluate the sternal perfusion. Sternal uptake was significantly increased in the FGF group (30 minutes: 221 % ± 30 % vs 180 % ± 36 %; 60 minutes: 267 % ± 26 % vs 197 % ± 42 %; P <. 01). Apparent sternal dehiscence, as assessed radiographically, was observed only in the control animals. Histologically, complete healing of the sternum with marked angiogenesis was observed in the FGF group, whereas poor healing with limited angiogenesis was seen in the control animals. Both bone mineral content (134 ± 49 vs 52 ± 32 mg, P <. 01) and bone mineral density (133 ± 53 vs 66 ± 32 mg/mm 2, P <. 05) along the incision line of the sternum, as assessed by means of dual-energy x-ray absorptometry, were higher in the FGF group. ConclusionsA gelatin sheet incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor enhances sternal perfusion and accelerates sternal bone healing in large animals. 2...|$|E
40|$|Does {{performing}} drop jumps {{with additional}} eccentric loading improve jump performance? J Strength Cond Res 28 (8) : 2314 – 2323, 2014 —Previous investigators {{have speculated that}} applying additional external load throughout the eccentric phase of the jumping movement could amplify the stretch-shortening cycle mechanism and modulate jumping performance and jump exercise intensity. The aims of this study, therefore, were {{to determine the effect}} of increased eccentric phase loading, as delivered using an elastic device, on drop jumps (DJs) performed from different drop heights. Of specific interest were changes in (a) the kinetics; eccentric and concentric <b>impulse,</b> <b>rate</b> of force development (RFD), concentric velocity and (b) the electromyographic (EMG) activity of leg muscles. In a randomized repeated-measure study, 15 highly resistance trained male subjects performed DJs from 3 heights (20, 35, and 50 cm) under 3 different conditions: body weight only (free DJ) and with elastic bands providing downward force equivalent to 20 % (+ 20 % DJ) and 30 % (+ 30 % DJ) of body mass. All DJs were recorded using video and force plate data that were synchronized with EMG data. Results demonstrated that using additional tensile load during the airborne and eccentric phases of the DJ could enhance eccentric impulse (p = 0. 042) and RFD (p ES > 0. 51). The observed greater eccentric loading, however, did not immediately alter concentric kinetics and jump height nor did it alter muscle activation levels during this phase. The findings indicated that, in addition to the conventional technique of increasing drop height, using a tensile load during the airborne and eccentric phases of the DJ could further improve eccentric loading of DJs. As {{it has been suggested that}} eccentric impulse and RFD are indicators of DJ exercise intensity, these findings suggest that the loaded DJs, using additional elastic load, may be an effective technique for improving DJ exercise intensity without acute effects on the jumping performance and neuromuscular activation level in highly trained athletes...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of motoneurone dynamic sensitivity in compensating for the low-pass filter properties of muscle {{was assessed by}} stimulating cat muscle units (MUs) with impulse discharges generated by two current-to-rate converters: (i) a spinal motoneurone, sensitive to both the input intensity and its first derivative, and (ii) a linear current-to-rate converter, i. e. a neurone model with the same static sensitivity as the motoneurone but lacking dynamic sensitivity. Discharges generated by injection of sine-wave currents in three motoneurones of the ‘fast’ type and in the three related model versions were applied to the axon of forty-six MUs. The MU isometric tension was modulated at {{the frequency of the}} current sine wave (0. 5 - 20 Hz). Phase and gain of the current-to-force transduction were measured. When MUs were driven by the model, the force lagged the current by 90 deg at 1 Hz in slow MUs and at around 5 Hz in fast MUs. Under motoneurone drive, the 90 deg phase lag was attained at frequencies about twice as high. The gain of the transduction (peak-to-peak force modulation/peak-to-peak current modulation) decayed when the modulation frequency was increased. In all but five units, the cut-off frequency, Fco (gain attenuated by − 3 dB), was higher when the unit was motoneurone driven (FcoCell) then when it was model driven (FcoMod). In both conditions, Fco was inversely correlated with the MU's time-to-peak. The advantage conferred by the motoneurone dynamic sensitivity was expressed by the Fco ratio (FcoCell/FcoMod). Across the MU population this ratio ranged from 0. 6 - 2. 8, was inversely correlated with the time-to peak, and was directly correlated with the half-tension rate, i. e. the <b>impulse</b> <b>rate</b> at which MUs develop 50 % of their maximal tetanic force. The largest improvement (Fco ratio > 2. 0) was found in units with mechanical features similar to those presumably coupled ‘in vivo’ to the motoneurones utilized for stimulation. This estimate was confirmed in experiments in which trains of pulses, generated by injection of ramp currents in another motoneurone and the related model, were used to activate eight MUs, selected for being similar to that connected ‘in vivo’ to the motoneurone. As expected, for any given current slope the rising phase of isometric tension was steeper when units were motoneurone driven than when they were model driven. The gain (force slope/current slope) was plotted against the ramp slope to identify the cut-off slope, Sco, at which the gain was attenuated by − 3 dB. In this homogeneous MU sample, the ratio expressing the advantage of the motoneurone drive (ScoCell/ScoMod, equivalent to the Fco ratio), ranged from 2. 62 – 2. 97, values comparable with those observed in sine-wave experiments when the motoneurone and muscle units were properly matched...|$|E
