[...] On the southwest side, the fire kept on burning slowly down slope through the Three Sisters Wilderness Area, occasionally torching pockets of taller trees. [...] On 8 September, thunderstorms {{passed through the}} region, dropping a light rain {{over much of the}} fire area. The moisture reduced fires activity and aided <b>humidity</b> <b>recovery.</b> [...] During this period, the number of firefighters on station was steadily reduced to 59 on September 10. [...] On that date, the Forest Service estimated the Milli Fire covered [...] with containment remaining at 60 percent. [...] The total cost of fighting the fire was estimated at $15 million. Between September 11 and September 14, the fire continued to burning slowly down slope through the Three Sisters Wilderness toward lava beds, which create a natural fire break because there was no fuel to burn in the lava fields. [...] During this period, fire crews patrolled the existing fire lines and finished mopping up hot spots. [...] Forest Service and Oregon Department of Transportation crews also removed hazardous trees from the Route 242 corridor and repaired culverts along the roadway.|$|E

The evaporator and condenser sections were 0. 19 Â m long, the adiabatic sections 0. 08 Â m long, the hot air velocity was 0. 5, 0. 75 or 1. 0 Â m/s with the hot air temperature 50, 60 or 70 Â Â°C, and the relative humidity was 100 %. The working fluid was R 134 a with a filling ratio of 50 %. The hot-air temperature increased from 50 to 70 Â Â°C; the heat-transfer rate increased slightly.

Cabergoline, dissolved in a 1 % acetic acid solution, and its carboxylic acid hydrolysis product can be assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. When stored at 4 °C and at room temperature, cabergoline in solution was stable for up to 36 days. When stored under cool (≤ 15 °C), dry conditions, cabergoline (800 µg) in commercial Foxoff® and deep-fried ox-liver baits was stable for 28 and 7 days, respectively; stability was reduced by increases in temperature (tested up to 40 °C) and <b>humidity.</b> <b>Recovery</b> of cabergoline from buried baits exposed to a range of field conditions decreased rapidly in the first week, but after 56 days remained detectable at levels of 6 – 22 % of the injected amounts.

30|$|Good {{examples}} of low-energy and nearly zero-energy residential houses {{have been built}} in Sweden {{during the past decade}} [3, 4]. However, at the time of writing, there are very few {{examples of}} low-energy office buildings. In Germany, on the other hand, a number of passive and low-energy office buildings have been constructed and evaluated (see examples of demonstration projects in [5, 6]). Also, research on energy efficiency potential for a passive office building in Germany has been carried out with dynamic simulations by Knissel [7]. Knissel shows that the primary energy requirement of an example building in Frankfurt can be reduced by 70 % with high insulation levels in the building envelope, low electricity consumption for equipment and lighting, no active cooling, heat and <b>humidity</b> <b>recovery</b> and earth-to-air heat exchangers. These German experiences are clearly important for the development of future zero-energy office buildings. However, they must be adapted to a Swedish context, as building techniques, climate conditions and indoor comfort criteria differ between the countries. For example, the sum of heating and cooling degree days is larger and the amount of useful daylight is smaller in Sweden compared to Germany, which affects the heating, cooling and lighting strategies. In order to bridge this gap, the project ‘Energy-efficient office buildings with low internal heat gains: simulations and design guidelines’ was initiated. The overall aim of the project is to provide knowledge to the Swedish building industry, supporting the development of cost-effective office buildings with good indoor climate and very low energy use. The main goal is to reduce the annual energy use by 50 %, compared to the requirements in the Swedish building code.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} examined {{physiological and}} performance effects of cooling on recovery of medium-fast bowlers in the heat. Eight, medium-fast bowlers completed two randomised trials, involving two sessions completed on consecutive days (Session 1 : 10 -overs and Session 2 : 4 -overs) in 31 ± 3 °C and 55 ± 17 % relative <b>humidity.</b> <b>Recovery</b> interventions were administered for 20 min (mixed-method cooling vs. control) after Session 1. Measures included bowling performance (ball speed, accuracy, run-up speeds), physical demands (global positioning system, counter-movement jump), physiological (heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, sweat loss), biochemical (creatine kinase, C-reactive protein) and perceptual variables (perceived exertion, thermal sensation, muscle soreness). Mean ball speed was higher after cooling in Session 2 (118. 9 ± 8. 1 vs. 115. 5 ± 8. 6 km · h− 1; P = 0. 001; d = 0. 67), reducing declines in ball speed between sessions (0. 24 vs. − 3. 18 km · h− 1; P = 0. 03; d = 1. 80). Large effects indicated higher accuracy in Session 2 after cooling (46. 0 ± 11. 2 vs. 39. 4 ± 8. 6 arbitrary units [AU]; P = 0. 13; d = 0. 93) without affecting total run-up speed (19. 0 ± 3. 1 vs. 19. 0 ± 2. 5 km · h− 1; P = 0. 97; d = 0. 01). Cooling reduced core temperature, skin temperature and thermal sensation throughout the intervention (P = 0. 001 – 0. 05; d = 1. 31 – 5. 78) and attenuated creatine kinase (P = 0. 04; d = 0. 56) and muscle soreness at 24 -h (P = 0. 03; d = 2. 05). Accordingly, mixed-method cooling can reduce thermal strain after a 10 -over spell and improve markers of muscular damage and discomfort alongside maintained medium-fast bowling performance on consecutive days in hot conditions...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella typhimurium survived {{freeze-drying}} at a platen {{temperature of}} 120 F (48. 9 C) and also, though {{to a much}} lesser degree, at 160 F (82. 6 C). The extent of the survival at these temperatures was dependent on {{the composition of the}} model system employed. The incidence of damage immediately after freeze-drying was greater for cells dried at the higher platen temperature and was influenced by the composition of the menstruum in which the cells were dried. In model systems having protein-dominant isotherms, survival during subsequent storage depended greatly on relative <b>humidity,</b> with <b>recovery</b> highest at relative humidities below those corresponding to moisture contents at which a monomolecular layer is formed. In menstrua having a higher sugar content, survival was best at low relative humidities corresponding to a very low equilibrium moisture content in the model system used. Damage during storage tended to be a function of the composition of the gels in which the organisms were freeze-dried, and also depended greatly on the presence of air and on the relative humidity. The maximal percentage of damage usually occurred at the low relative humidities as storage time increased...|$|R

40|$|The {{adjustment}} {{of the tropical}} climate outside the Pacific (the “remote Tropics”) to the abrupt onset of El Niño conditions is examined in a tropical atmosphere model that assumes simplified vertical structure and quasi-equilibrium (QE) convective closure. The El Niño signal is rapidly (1 week) communicated to the remote Tropics via an eastward-propagating Kelvin-like wave that induces both anomalous subsidence and tropospheric warming. Widespread reductions in convective precipitation occur {{in conjunction with the}} spreading of the temperature and subsidence anomalies. The remote rainfall suppression peaks roughly 5 – 15 days after the initiation of El Niño conditions, after which the anomalous remote rainfall field recovers to a state characterized by a smaller remote areal mean rainfall deficit and the appearance of localized positive rainfall anomalies. The initial remote precipitation reduction after El Niño onset is tied to both tropospheric warming (i. e., stabilization of the troposphere to deep convection) and the suppression of remote <b>humidity</b> levels; <b>recovery</b> of the initial deficits occurs as feedbacks modulate the subsequent evo-lution of humidity anomalies in the tropospheric column. Apart from the short-term response, there is a longer-term {{adjustment of}} the remote climate related to the thermal inertia of the underlying surface: surface thermal disequilibrium, which is related to the depth of the ocean mixed layer, maintains larger precipitation deficits than would be expected for equilibrated conditions. This result supports a previous prediction by one of the authors for a significant disequilibrium mechanism in the precipitation telecon-nection to El Niño resulting from the local vertical coupling of the troposphere to the surface through moist convection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{investigate}} heat balance; especially heat loss and heat load. Four standardbred trotters (geldings, 3 - 8 years, 420 - 520 kg) performed twice an inclined (1. 4) incremental treadmill exercise test in two minutes steps (7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 m/s) in indoor conditions (15 C, 40 % Relative <b>humidity).</b> The <b>recovery</b> was monitored for 120 minutes. We measured throughout the entire experiment: heart rate, respiratory rate and temperatures in central venous blood, the gluteus medius muscle and radiated from skin. Oxygen uptake and sweat rate were measured during exercise and 30 minutes after exercise. The rate of non-evaporative heat loss was estimated from measured parameters. The data were analysed for correlations. The results showed that as the intensity of work increase, the pathways of dissipated heat shifted; skin non-evaporative (75 % š 20 %), sweat (4 % š 55 %), and respiratory (21 % š 25 %) heat loss. We found the following correlations between 1) central venous temperature and muscle temperature (R 2 = 0. 81), 2) central venous temperature and oxygen uptake (R 2 = 0. 85), 3) intensity of work (%VO 2 max) and momentary heat load in W. m- 2 (R 2 = 0. 97), 4) accumulated heat load and muscle temperature (individual R 2 = 0. 94 - 0. 99, overall R 2 = 0. 71) during exercise, where specific heat of the horse was estimated to 2500 J. kg- 1.

40|$|Engineering {{approaches}} used in {{the study}} of textile fibers have been applied to the measurement of mechanical properties of bacterial cell walls by using the Bacillus subtilis bacterial thread system. Improved methods have been developed for the production of thread and for measuring its mechanical properties. The best specimens of thread produced from cultures of strain FJ 7 grown in TB medium at 20 degrees C varied in diameter by a factor of 1. 09 over a 30 -mm thread length. The stress-strain behavior of cell walls was determined over the range of relative humidities between 11 and 98 %. Measurements of over 125 specimens indicated that cell wall behaved like other viscoelastic polymers, both natural and man-made, exhibiting relaxation under constant elongation and recovery upon load removal. This kinetic behavior and also the cell wall strength depended greatly on <b>humidity.</b> The <b>recovery</b> from extension observed after loading even up to a substantial fraction of the breaking load indicated that the properties measured were those of cell wall material rather than of behavior of the thread assemblage. Control experiments showed that neither drying of thread nor the length of time it remained dry before testing influenced the mechanical properties of the cell walls. Specimens drawn from TB medium and then washed in water and redrawn were found to be stiffer and stronger than controls not washed. However, tensile properties were not changed by exposure of cells to lysozyme before thread production. This suggests that glycan backbones are not arranged {{along the length of the}} cell cylinder. The strength of the cell wall in vivo was estimated by extrapolation to 100 % relative humidity to be about 3 N/mm 2. Walls of this strength would be able to bear a turgor pressure of 6 atm (ca. 607. 8 kPa), but if the increase in strength of water-washed threads was appropriate, the figure could be 24 atm (ca. 2, 431. 2 kPa) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{sampling}} {{capability of}} Tenax-TA tubes, {{used in the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's solid sorbent air sampler to trap and concentrate contaminants from air aboard spacecraft, was improved by incorporating two sorbents within the tubes. Existing tubes containing only Tenax-TA allowed highly volatile compounds to "break through" during collection of a 1. 5 L air sample. First the carbon molecular sieve-type sorbents Carboxen 569 and Carbosieve S-III were tested {{for their ability to}} quantitatively trap the highly volatile compounds. Breakthrough volumes were determined with the direct method, whereby low ppm levels of methanol or Freon 12 in nitrogen were flowed through the sorbent tubes at 30 mL/min, and breakthrough was detected by gas chromatography. Breakthrough volumes for methanol were about 9 L/g on Carboxen 569 and 11 L/g on Carbosieve S-III; breakthrough volumes for Freon 12 were about 7 L/g on Carboxen 569 and > 26 L/g on Carbosieve S-III. Next, dual-bed tubes containing either Tenax-TA/Carbosieve S-III, Tenax-TA/Carboxen 569, or Carbotrap/Carboxen 569 to a 10 -component gas mixture were exposed, in dry and in humidified air (50 % relative <b>humidity),</b> and percentage <b>recoveries</b> of each compound were determined. The Tenax-TA/Carboxen 569 combination gave the best overall recoveries (75 - 114 % for the 10 compounds).

40|$|Coccoid algae in the Trebouxia genus are {{the most}} common photobionts of chlorolichens but are only {{sporadically}} found in soil or bark outside of a lichen. They all appear to be desiccation tolerant, i. e. they can survive drying to water contents of below 10 %. However, little is known about their longevity in the dry state and to which extent lichenization can influence it. Here, we studied the longevity in the dry state of the lichenized alga (LT) Trebouxia sp. in the lichen Parmotrema perlatum, in comparison with axenically grown cultures (CT) isolated from the same lichen. We report on chlorophyll fluorescence emission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production before desiccation, after 15 – 45 days in the dry state under different combinations of light and air <b>humidity</b> and after <b>recovery</b> for 1 or 3 days in fully hydrated conditions. Both the CT and the LT were able to withstand desiccation under high light (120 lmol photons m- 2 s- 1 for 14 h per day), but upon recovery after 45 days in the dry state the performance of the CT was better than that of the LT. By contrast, the quenching of excess light energy was more efficient in the LT, at high relative humidities especially. ROS production in the LT was influenced mostly by light exposure, whereas the CT showed an oxidative burst independent of the light conditions. Although lichenization provides benefits that are essential for the survival of the photobiont in high-light habitats, Trebouxia sp. can withstand protracted periods of photo-oxidative stress even outside of a lichen thallus...|$|R

To compare simulated tropical conditions with freezer storage, we examined the stability of HIV- 1 DNA in dried blood spots (DBS) stored in humid heat and at − 20 °C. DBS were created by spotting 50 -μl aliquots of whole blood on 903 filter paper. DNA was extracted from DBS at baseline and after 2, 6, or 12 months of storage at − 20 °C or at 37 °C with ∼ 85 % humidity. The DNA was tested undiluted or diluted using the Amplicor HIV- 1 DNA PCR (Roche), version 1. 5. Each reaction was scored positive, negative, or indeterminate based on optical density. Results were compared between storage conditions and over time. A total of 1, 832 reactions from 916 DBS were analyzed, including 100 DBS at baseline, 418 stored at − 20 °C, and 398 stored at 37 °C. A chi-square test showed fewer positive reactions for DBS stored at 37 °C (55 %) than for those stored at − 20 °C (78 %) (P < 0. 0001).

T (re) (37. 0 +/- A 0. 3 A degrees C for ISB vs. 37. 4 +/- A 0. 2 A degrees C for CLB, P = 0. 001) and physiological strain index (0. 2 +/- A 0. 6 for ISB vs. 1. 1 +/- A 0. 9 for CLB, P = 0. 009) were lower {{at the end of}} recovery and before the performance trial after ingestion of the ISB compared with the CLB.

Changes in plasma volume and the concentrations of blood variables (i. e., glucose, lactate, electrolytes, cortisol and catecholamines) were similar between the two trials. In conclusion, ingestion of ISB did not significantly alter exercise performance even though it significantly reduced pre-exercise T (re) compared with CLB. Irrespective of exercise performance outcomes, ingestion of ISB during recovery from exercise in hot humid environments is a practical and effective method for cooling athletes following exercise in hot environments...|$|R
