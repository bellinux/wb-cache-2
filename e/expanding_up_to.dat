The STFRM followed Vallejo's call for higher wages, an increase of 350 pesos a month, this became known as [...] "Plan of the Southeast." [...] The strikes were supported by the workers, however failed to gain support of its own union leader, Ortega Hernandez. The strikes began as the demands were not met. On June 26, 1958, the first strike lasted 2 hours and was participated in by almost 60,000 members. The following day on June 27, a 4-hour strike was held, and on June 28, a 6-hour strike. The strike on June 28 was not only of railroad workers, but found the support of petroleum workers, teachers, and students. President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines stepped in before the final steps of strike escalation. Cortines proposed a middle ground between the offer of the railroad, 200 pesos, and the lowered demand by the union of 250 pesos, settling on 215 pesos which was accepted by all parties.|$|E
50|$|This deadly, long-track EF3 tornado first {{touched down}} in Menifee County, Kentucky to the {{southwest}} of Mariba. It rapidly attained EF3 strength before moving east and passing {{to the south of}} Wellington, heavily damaging or destroying multiple homes along this segment of the path, snapping or uprooting many large trees, killing two people, and injuring many others. One block foundation home was removed from its foundation and leveled, while a nearby brick home lost its roof and exterior walls. A brick split-level home had only its basement floor remaining, {{with the rest of the}} house being completely carried away and disintegrated. Structural debris and house contents from this location was strewn long distances across nearby hillsides. Further east, the tornado expanded to nearly a mile wide and entered Morgan County, passing north of Ezel before ripping directly through downtown West Liberty at EF3 strength, resulting in catastrophic damage. Massive structural damage occurred in the downtown square of West Liberty, with many brick buildings and businesses being heavily damaged or destroyed, and many vehicles being tossed against buildings or crushed by falling structural debris. Every building in and around the downtown area sustained major damage, with the 105-year-old courthouse, the depression-era WPA building that housed the community center, and the 100-year-old West Liberty United Methodist and Christian churches all being either heavily damaged or suffering total destruction. The local hospital sustained major damage as well. Residential areas in town were also devastated with numerous homes destroyed, including some unanchored homes that were swept from their foundations. Footage of the tornado in this area revealed a rapidly rotating lowered cloud base with a large debris cloud underneath, but no visible condensation funnel. Six people were killed in West Liberty, and many others were injured, some severely. Past West Liberty, the tornado continued through other rural portions of the county, <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a full mile wide as it snapped thousands of trees and caused extensive damage to structures. Maintaining EF3 strength, the tornado then briefly moved through a portion of Lawrence County near the community of Terryville, obliterating several mobile homes and injuring two people. Crossing into Johnson County, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength as downed many trees and caused roof damage to several structures before crossing back into Lawrence County and regaining EF3 strength as it passed near Martha, Blaine, and a few other rural communities further to the east. 30 homes and mobile homes were destroyed along this segment of the path, 9 others sustained major damage, and the Blaine community building was damaged as well. A double-wide mobile home was lofted and slammed into a hillside by the tornado, killing two people inside. The tornado then crossed the state border into Wayne County, West Virginia.|$|E
40|$|During {{the search}} for {{counterparts}} of very high energy gamma-ray sources, we serendipitously discovered large, extended, low surface brightness emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) around pulsars with the ages up to ~ 100 kyr, a discovery {{made possible by the}} low and stable background of the Suzaku X-ray satellite.

Moreover, in order to explain the observed correlation between the X-ray size and the pulsar spin-down age, the magnetic field strength in the PWNe must decrease with time...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we define and {{quantize}} a truncated form of the nonassociative and noncommutative Snyder phi^ 4 field theory using the functional method in momentum space. More precisely, the action is approximated by <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the linear order in the Snyder deformation parameter beta, producing an effective model on commutative spacetime for the computation of the two-, four- and six-point functions. The two- and four-point functions at one loop have the same structure as at the tree level, with UV divergences faster than in the commutative theory. The same behavior appears in the six-point function, with a logarithmic UV divergence and renders the theory unrenormalizable at beta^ 1 order except for the special choice of free parameters s_ 1 =-s_ 2. We expect effects from nonassociativity on the correlation functions at beta^ 1 order, but these are cancelled due to the average over permutations. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|We {{describe}} a 3 D numerical procedure for {{the reconstruction of}} conductivity profiles, a classic nonlinear inverse problem. The related direct field problem is discretized using a finite elements differential formulation in terms of magnetic vector potential and electric scalar potential. Adopting shape functions based on edge-elements, the vector potential is gauged using a tree-cotree decomposition of the finite element mesh. The nonlinear inverse problem is approximated by <b>expanding,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the second order, the nonlinear operator mapping the conductivity into the magnetic field at the probes location. The solution is obtained by minimizing an error functional related to the distance between measurements and their numerical approximation. The geometrical properties of this error functional are reviewed, showing how the presence of local minima can be controlled. From the numerical point of view, this perturbative approach enlarges the range of validity of the classic linear Born approximation, since the quadratic term takes into account, at least partially, the effects due to the reaction field. Several examples highlight the main features of the method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Streaming {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} {{in a variety of}} environments, from cloud computing infrastructures up to the network's edge. In these contexts, accurate modeling of streaming operators' performance enables fine-grained prediction of applications' behavior without the need of costly monitoring. This is of utmost importance for computationally-expensive operators like stream joins, that observe throughput and latency very sensitive to rate-varying data streams, especially when deterministic processing is required. In this paper, we present a modeling framework for estimating the throughput and the latency of stream join processing. The model is presented in an incremental step-wise manner, starting from a centralized non-deterministic stream join and <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a deterministic parallel stream join. The model describes how the dynamics of throughput and latency are influenced by the number of physical input streams, {{as well as by the}} amount of parallelism in the actual processing and the requirement for determinism. We present an experimental validation of the model with respect to the actual implementation. The proposed model can provide insights that are catalytic for understanding the behavior of stream joins against different system deployments, with special emphasis on the influences of determinism and parallelization...|$|E

The development of cochlear implants for use in very young children (1 - 2 years old) will require techniques designed to accommodate temporal bone growth. Previous anatomic {{studies have shown that the}} leadwire of a cochlear implant must be capable of <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20 mm between the round window and the implanted receiver-stimulator in response to skull growth. In the present study morphologic and biomechanical evaluation of five expandable leadwire designs was conducted following their implantation in young cats. Two helical shaped leadwire designs frequently exhibited extensive fibrous tissue adhesions and broke during long-term implantation. In contrast, thin, flexible Silastic envelopes were effective in minimizing tissue adhesions. Residual V- and Z-shaped leadwires, placed in these envelopes, showed little evidence of fibrous tissue adhesions following implantation periods of up to 2 years. Moreover, these leadwires readily expanded both during the growth of the animal and when biomechanical expansion studies performed at the completion of the implant period. These expandable leadwire designs appear to be appropriate candidates for use in pediatric cochlear implants. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we use the noncommutative (NC) kappa-Minkowski phi^ 4 model based on the kappa-deformed star product, ({*}_h). The action is {{modified}} by <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> linear order in the kappa-deformation parameter a, producing an effective model on commutative spacetime. For the computation of the tadpole diagram contributions to the scalar field propagation/self-energy, we anticipate that statistics on the kappa-Minkowski is specifically kappa-deformed. Thus our prescription in fact represents hybrid approach between standard quantum field theory (QFT) and NCQFT on the kappa-deformed Minkowski spacetime, resulting in a kappa-effective model. The propagation is analyzed {{in the framework of}} the two-point Green's function for low, intermediate, and for the Planckian propagation energies, respectively. Semiclassical/hybrid behavior of the first order quantum correction do show up due to the kappa-deformed momentum conservation law. For low energies, the dependence of the tadpole contribution on the deformation parameter a drops out completely, while for Planckian energies, it tends to a fixed finite value. The mass term of the scalar field is shifted and these shifts are very different at different propagation energies. At the Planckian energies we obtain the direction dependent kappa-modified dispersion relations. Thus our kappa-effective model for the massive scalar field shows a birefringence effect.

40|$|Musculoskeletal fibromatosis {{remains a}} disease of unknown etiology. Surgical {{excision}} is the standard of care, but the recurrence rate remains high. Superficial fibromatosis typically presents as subcutaneous nodules caused by rapid myofibroblast proliferation followed by slow involution to dense acellular fibrosis. In this study, we demonstrate that fibromatosis stem cells (FSCs) can be isolated from palmar nodules but not from cord or normal palm tissues. We found that FSCs express surface markers such as CD 29, CD 44, CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, and CD 166 but do not express CD 34, CD 45, or CD 133. We also found that FSCs are capable of <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20 passages, that these cells include myofibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cells, and that these cells possess multipotentiality to develop into the three germ layer cells. When implanted beneath the dorsal skin of nude mice, FSCs recapitulated human fibromatosis nodules. Two weeks after implantation, the cells expressed immunodiagnostic markers for myofibroblasts such as α-smooth muscle actin and type III collagen. Two months after implantation, there were fewer myofibroblasts and type I collagen became evident. Treatment with the antifibrogenic compound Trichostatin A (TSA) inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of FSCs in vitro. Treatment with TSA before or after implantation blocked formation of fibromatosis nodules. These results suggest that FSCs are the cellular origin of fibromatosis and that these cells may provide a promising model for developing new therapeutic interventions...|$|E

40|$|Background Zymoseptoria tritici, the causative {{organism}} of Septoria tritici blotch {{disease is a}} prevalent biotic stressor of wheat production, exerting substantial economic constraints on farmers, requiring intensive chemical control to protect yields. A hemibiotrophic pathogen with a long asymptomless phase of up to 11  days post inoculation (dpi) before a rapid switch to necrotrophy; a deficit exists {{in our understanding of}} the events occurring within the host during the two phases of infection. Brachypodium distachyon has demonstrated its potential as a model species for the investigation of fungal disease resistance in cereal and grass species. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the physical interaction between Z. tritici (strain IPO 323) and B. distachyon and examine its potential as a model pathosystem for Z. tritici. Results Septoria tritici blotch symptoms developed on the wheat cultivar Riband from 12 dpi with pycnidial formation abundant by 20 dpi. Symptoms on B. distachyon ecotype Bd 21 - 1 were visible from 1 dpi: characteristic pale, water soaked lesions which developed into blotch-like lesions by 4 dpi. These lesions then became necrotic with chlorotic regions <b>expanding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 dpi. Sporulation on B. distachyon tissues was not observed and no evidence of fungal penetration could be obtained, indicating that Z. tritici was unable to complete its life cycle within B. distachyon ecotypes. However, observation of host responses to the Z. tritici strain IPO 323 in five B. distachyon ecotypes revealed a variation in resistance responses, ranging from immunity to a chlorotic/necrotic phenotype. Conclusions The observed interactions suggest that B. distachyon is an incompatible host for Z. tritici infection, with STB symptom development on B. distachyon comparable to that observed during the early infection stages on the natural host, wheat. However first visible symptoms occurred more rapidly on B. distachyon; from 1 dpi in comparison to 12 dpi in wheat. Consequently, we propose that the interaction between B. distachyon and Z. tritici as observed in this study could serve as a suitable model pathosystem with which to investigate mechanisms underpinning an incompatible host response to Z. tritici. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|E
