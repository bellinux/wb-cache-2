5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
500|$|According to Woolverton, {{the story}} team {{challenged}} nearly every line of dialogue Woolverton suggested for the character. On one occasion, the story artists re-wrote what Woolverton had originally scripted as Belle using a map to indicate places {{to where she}} would like to travel to the character baking a cake. Arguing that the liberated Belle would not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> bake, Woolverton decided to compromise by having the character read a book instead, which was similarly debated because some filmmakers considered reading to be too passive an activity. To resolve this, Woolverton scripted Belle walk while reading, an activity in which Woolverton herself partook as a child. In Beaumont's fairy tale, Belle is essentially forced to replace her father as the Beast's prisoner. To make the character more independent, Woolverton re-wrote her so that she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father, bravely confronts the Beast and ultimately trades her own freedom in return for Maurice's instead. During Gaston's climactic fight with the Beast, the character's line [...] "Time to die!" [...] was changed to [...] "Belle is mine!" [...] in order to return the focus of the story to Belle.|$|E

Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

2500|$|Gable's {{marriage}} in 1939 to his third wife, actress Carole Lombard (1908–1942), was the happiest period {{of his personal}} life. They met while filming 1932's No Man of Her Own, when Lombard was still married to actor William Powell, but their romance did not take off until 1936. They became reacquainted at a party and soon were inseparable, cited in fan magazines and tabloids as an official couple. Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating, [...] "You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> think about letting you down." [...] Lombard, for her part, seemed to gain personal stability and a contented home life that she had previously lacked. She taught herself how to hunt and fish and accompanied Gable on trips with his hunting companions.|$|E

Incubus is, however, seen as a common, joke way of first introducing a person to Esperanto as none of the actors <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> pronounce Esperanto in the first place, the dialogue is strange and bad due to the scriptwriter not getting a second opinion before the filming was done, and the plot is confusing in general.|$|R

However, except for qualitative speculations, {{it is not}} <b>even</b> <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> measure the spatio-temporal correlation, let alone <b>how</b> <b>to</b> re-produce it realistically. In this paper, we propose the “entropy plots” to quantify the correlation and develop a new statistical model, the “PQRS” model, to capture the burstiness and correlation of the real spatio-temporal traffic. Moreover, the model requires very few parameters and offers linear scalability. Experiments with multiple real data sets show that our model can mimic real traces very well...|$|R
