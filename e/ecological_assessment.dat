25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an <b>ecological</b> <b>assessment,</b> a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E

40|$|Since the Ramsar {{meeting in}} 1971 many plans and {{agreements}} are developed to conserve {{and improve the}} quality of wetlands throughout the world. Within the European Union for example legislation has been developed in four Directives which require that water managers test activities on ecological effects. Moreover, in most areas measures have to be taken and included in river basin management plans in order to achieve ecological objectives in terms of occurrence of species and habitats set by EU Directives. To improve quality and conserve areas it is needed to assess the effects of current land use and autonomous developments and to identify the effectiveness of measures. Different studies have already addressed the need for models to quantify these effects. We developed a conceptual framework to analyse the cause‐effect chain from management to new environmental conditions and to the potential occurrence and quality of species and habitats using response curves. To our knowledge, this is the first framework presented that has the <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> embedded within the structure, which allows for <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> within the development of management plans rather than {{at the end of the}} development. For this purpose a spatial analysis tool is used (HABITAT), which is developed for a broad spectrum of users, from ecologists to managers, and purposes, from <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> to flood risk assessments. The framework is applicable on an (inter) national scale and can promote the dialog between politicians, managers and ecologists.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{explored}} the "shifting baseline syndrome" (SBS), {{which suggests that}} individual perceptions of environmental health are formed by comparing the environment to a "baseline" from the past. Understanding social perceptions of environmental conditions, especially where they differ from <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments,</b> can help guide environmental management efforts. In this study we compared <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> of coral reef health with perceptions of reef health from surveyed residents in five villages in Solomon Islands and Fiji. Comparative analysis suggests that respondents from Solomon Islands perceived their reefs as being degraded, yet based on ecological measurements actually had healthier reefs, while in Fiji fewer people perceived their reefs to be declining in health, yet ecological measurement showed {{them to be more}} degraded than Solomon Islands reefs. We found no evidence of baselines "shifting" relative to respondent age in this instance and suggest that these differential baselines and the inverse relationship between local perceptions and ecological measurements may be a result of: (1) differences in the rate of environmental change experienced at local scales; and (2) may also be related to differences in respondent perceptions of "quality of life" at each site. If the success of conservation approaches such as marine protected areas (MPAs) are dependent on local social consensus that natural resources are diminished or degraded, then tracking broader social indicators like "quality of life" and "rates of change" (real and perceived) alongside <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> of environmental health may prove beneficial to conservation practitioners...|$|R

The sensitivity of eight Chinese plant species (bok choy, mustard, tomato, green chilli, paddy rice, barley, spinach and celery) to copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) toxicity in two Chinese soils was investigated to assess their potential use for <b>ecological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> in the region. The results showed that bok choy and mustard were the two most sensitive species to Cu and Ni toxicities. Assessment of metal accumulation by the plants demonstrated that bok choy shoot had the highest bioconcentration factor (BCF, the ratio of metal concentration in plant shoots to metal concentration in soil). Given the importance of bok choy to agricultural production in Asia, it is therefore important that these sensitive plant species are included in species sensitivity distributions for <b>ecological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> of Cu and Ni in soils...|$|R

This presentation considers the value of <b>ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> designed to integrate regional conservation planning with environmental regulatory compliance that support ecologically appropriate transportation planning and project delivery. Recent transportation legislation (SAFETEA-LU) requires transportation agencies to consider environmental considerations in their regional and state-wide transportation plans, Earlier transportation required Federal agencies to coordinate environmental reviews to address multiple regulatory compliance simultaneously rather sequentially whenever possible. This requirement has been retained in the in SAFETEA-LU. <b>Ecological</b> <b>assessments</b> have been developed to address a variety of objectives.
