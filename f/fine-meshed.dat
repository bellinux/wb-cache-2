25|$|Krill {{are small}} animals, {{considered}} {{a type of}} zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with <b>fine-meshed</b> plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have high drag, producing a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Trawling must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.|$|E
25|$|The webs of most Nephila spiders are complex, with a <b>fine-meshed</b> orb {{suspended}} in {{a maze of}} non-sticky barrier webs. As with many weavers of sticky spirals, the orb is renewed regularly if not daily, apparently because the stickiness of the orb declines with age. When weather is good (and no rain has damaged the orb web), subadult and adult Nephila often rebuild {{only a portion of}} the web. The spider will remove and consume the portion to be replaced, build new radial elements, then spin the new spirals. This partial orb renewal is distinct from other orb-weaving spiders that usually replace the entire orb web. In 2011 it was discovered that the web of Nephila antipodiana contains ant-repellent chemicals to protect the web.|$|E

60|$|Lord Roberts A {{very nearly}} {{terminated}} all my investigations. My idea both {{in this and}} its more successful and famous younger brother, Lord Roberts B, was to utilise {{the idea of a}} contractile balloon with a rigid flat base, a balloon shaped rather like an inverted boat that should almost support the apparatus, but not quite. The gas-bag was of the chambered sort used for these long forms, and not with an internal balloonette. The trouble was to make the thing contractile. This I sought to do by fixing a long, <b>fine-meshed</b> silk net over it that was fastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rods. Practically I contracted my sausage gas-bag by netting it down. The ends were too complex for me to describe here, but I thought them out elaborately and they were very carefully planned. Lord Roberts A was furnished with a single big screw forward, and there was a rudder aft. The engine {{was the first one to}} be, so to speak, right in the plane of the gas-bag. I lay immediately under the balloon on a sort of glider framework, far away from either engine or rudder, controlling them by wire-pulls constructed on the principle of the well-known Bowden brake of the cyclist.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of shredders to litter breakdown in a tropical stream in Hong Kong was investigated by using coarse- and <b>fine-mesh</b> bags to include or exclude large macroinvertebrates. Three native species, plus {{a mixture of}} all of them, were {{used to examine the}} effects of leaf type and species composition on breakdown. A well-studied temperate species, Alnus glutinosa, was included to benchmark breakdown rates in Hong Kong with counterpart streams outside the tropics. Shredders constituted 13 % of macroinvertebrates in coarse-mesh bags but were virtually absent from <b>fine-mesh</b> bags. However, abundance of macroinvertebrates (especially chironomids) in <b>fine-mesh</b> bags was almost twice that in coarse-mesh bags. Despite interspecific differences, litter breakdown rates were consistently faster in coarse-mesh bags, indicating a probable effect of shredders, although current velocity also influenced breakdown of one native species. Alnus glutinosa breakdown rates were within the range reported in temperate streams. The litter mixture broke down at a rate approximately equal to the mean of the constituent species and non-additive compositional effects (indicative of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships) were not apparent. Litter breakdown in <b>fine-mesh</b> bags was rapid relative to rates reported from temperate streams, despite the exclusion of shredders. Evidently, non-shredding macroinvertebrates and microbes played a significant role in litter breakdown in Hong Kong. © 2011 E.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of the <b>fine-mesh</b> high-order {{transport operator}} with a coarse-mesh low-order approximation, {{in order to}} reduce the computational requirements when simulating whole reactor cores, is studied here through the boundary conditions for the <b>fine-mesh</b> solver. A recently developed software, solving the neutron transport equation though a discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element discrete-ordinates method, is used for the <b>fine-mesh</b> high-order solver, and the coarse-mesh low-order solver is simulated by a coarsening process. As a first step, a verification and validation process is necessary to be performed. This is carried out using the softwares DRAGON and MCNP, respectively, as the references in the verification and validation processes. A very good agreement is obtained during the verification process, while for the validation, results show that different quadratures should be considered in order to improve the accuracy. In addition, a parametric study is presented, where the different parameters of the spatial and angular discretizations are analyzed, in order to understand the behavior of the solver for different configurations. A second part of the work consists in studying the effect of coarsening the boundary conditions for a particular problem (C 5 G 7 benchmark). This coarsening is performed to simulate the low-order approximation of the boundary conditions obtained with the coarse-mesh solver. Understanding the loss of accuracy for the <b>fine-mesh</b> calculations is necessary in order to improve the fine-mesh/coarse-mesh coupling for the neutronic solvers...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for <b>fine-mesh,</b> transient simulations of coupled neutronics and thermal- hydraulics for Light Water Reactor (LWR) fuel assemblies. The framework includes models of single- phase fluid transport for the coolant and conjugate-heat transfer between the coolant and the fuel pins, complemented by a neutronic solver. The thermal-hydraulic models {{are based on a}} CFD approach, resolving the pressure and velocity coupling via an iterative algorithm. Similarly, the neutronics is for- mulated in a <b>fine-mesh</b> manner with resolved fuel pins. The neutronic and thermal-hydraulic equations are discretized and solved in the same numerical framework (foam-extend- 3. 1). A test case of a quarter of a fuel pin is used to test the transient behavior of the code for a set of different initial reactivities. The same geometry is used to simulate a decrease of the inlet temperature, which demonstrates the response both in the CFD and the neutronics for an increase in reactivity. Furthermore, a system of 7 x 7 fuel pins is simulated with the same inlet temperature decrease and we present the temporal development of the temperature as well as an analysis of the heterogeneities captured by the <b>fine-mesh</b> approach. The solver is shown to capture the transient multiphysics couplings and demonstrates the numerical and computational applicability based on the presented cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of land important for climate are very heterogeneous, {{as are the}} key atmospheric inputs to land, i. e. precipitation and radiation. To adequately represent this heterogeneity, state-of-the-art climate models should represent atmospheric inputs to land, land properties, and the dynamical changes of land at the highest resolution accessible by climate models.

This allows representation of the land climate dynamics at a higher resolution than that achievable in the global atmospheric models. The high spatial detail of the <b>fine-mesh</b> treatment provides not only a more accurate representation of land processes to the atmospheric model, but also the opportunity for direct downscaling of the surface climate.

Shell {{representing}} “mud flat and/or sandy, shallow-water species” {{was found in}} large quantities, but it “tended to occur in concentrated lenses rather than in an evenly distributed fashion”. Oysters were initially dominant, but when “the silt-burdened lagoon floor was formed,” surrounding conditions became favorable for the proliferation of clams.

The frequency of oysters again surpassed that of clams in the diets of the occupants.
