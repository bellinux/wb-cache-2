40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} (SNF) {{antineutrino}} flux {{is an important}} source of uncertainties for a reactor neutrino flux prediction. However, if one want to determine the contribution of spent fuel, many data are needed, such as the amount of spent fuel in the pool, the time after <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> the reactor <b>core,</b> the burnup of each assembly, and the antineutrino spectrum of the isotopes in the spend fuel. A method to calculate the contribution of SNF is proposed in this study. In this method, reactor simulation code verified by experiment have been used to simulate the fuel depletion by taking into account more than 2000 isotopes and fission products, the quantity of SNF in each six spend fuel pool, and the antineutrino spectrum of SNF varying with time after SNF <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>core.</b> Results show that the contribution of SNF to the total antineutrino flux is about 0. 26...|$|R

40|$|Recirculating pebble-bed {{reactors}} are {{distinguished from}} all other reactor types by the downward movement through and reinsertion of fuel into the core during operation. Core simulators must account for this movement and mixing in order to capture the physics of the equilibrium cycle core. VSOP and PEBBED are two codes used to perform such simulations, but they do so using different methods. In this study, a simplified pebble-bed core with a specified flux profile and cross sections is used {{as the model for}} conducting analyses of two types of burnup schemes. The differences between the codes are described and related to the differences observed in the nuclide densities in pebbles <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> the <b>core.</b> Differences in the methods for computing fission product buildup and average number densities lead to significant differences in the computed core power and eigenvalue. These test models provide a key component of an overall equilibrium cycle benchmark involving neutron transport, cross section generation, and fuel circulation...|$|R

Jak and Daxter get the third sphere, but the Behemoth attacks their ship. Back on board, Jak, Daxter, Keira, Phoenix and the crew fix the Eco Seeker, which points to the abandoned research rig. Phoenix recalls that the rig was built over strange formations, later revealed to be an ancient Precursor facility. When they reach the Eco Core, Keira tries to fix it. Shortly after, Phoenix's right-hand man, Klout, arrives with Skyheed and reveals he was paid off by Skyheed in exchange for {{the location}} of the Core. Skyheed orders everyone killed except Jak, because he wants to study his control over Dark Eco.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the fluctuation of}} precipitation and air temperature <b>from</b> Dunde ice <b>core</b> data since 1606 comparing to meteorological data taken near the July 1 st glacier since 1930 s.

The result revealed that calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area increased with precipitation. Meanwhile, calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glaciers decreased with precipitation. Since little precipitation cause expose the glacier ice surface, which can absorb almost solar radiation, then glacier melt accelerated. Then, relatively large <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier can be provided when the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area is less.

50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the <b>core.</b> The gas <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> the <b>core</b> passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|R
