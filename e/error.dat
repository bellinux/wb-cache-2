The medication <b>errors</b> could be prescribing <b>errors,</b> dispensing <b>errors,</b> and administering <b>errors.</b> In this study medication <b>errors</b> randomly were collected by clinical pharmacist and inpatient pharmacist from different wards at a Hospital in Dubai, UAE, from July to October 2011. The {{results showed that the}} highest percentage of medication <b>errors</b> was prescribing <b>errors,</b> followed by administering <b>errors</b> and then dispensing <b>errors.</b> Among prescribing <b>errors,</b> the results showed the highest percentage was stat <b>errors,</b> followed by pro re nata(PRN), then incomplete or unclear Rx and at the end antibiotic <b>errors.</b> The study shows that the clinical pharmacist play important role in reduction of medication <b>errors</b> evolving from pharmacist and nursing site, on the other hand, prescribing <b>errors</b> were reduced up to 23 % with the medication review system...|$|R

30|$|Accuracy was {{measured}} in terms of the proportion of error-free T-units of all T-units (EFT/T) and <b>errors</b> per 100 words (total number of errors/total number of words ×  100). A T-unit was defined by Larsen-Freeman (2006) as “a minimal terminal unit or independent clause with whatever dependent clauses, phrases and words are attached to or embedded within it”. Independent clauses and dependent clauses were defined {{in the same way as}} Wigglesworth and Storch’s (2009) study. <b>Errors</b> in this study were mainly identified by Juku, including collocation <b>errors,</b> verb <b>errors,</b> article <b>errors,</b> preposition <b>errors,</b> word choice <b>errors,</b> subject-verb disagreement, sentence structure <b>errors,</b> etc. Word choice <b>errors</b> were included only when they impede meaning. Punctuation <b>errors</b> and spelling <b>errors</b> were excluded since these types of <b>errors</b> were not regarded as severe problems that may impede understanding.|$|R
50|$|Like other coins, {{the value}} of <b>errors</b> is based, in part at least, on rarity and condition. In general, lower {{denomination}} <b>errors</b> are less expensive than higher denomination <b>errors</b> simply more such coins are minted resulting in available <b>errors.</b> Modern <b>errors</b> are generally less expensive than older <b>errors</b> simply because, with billions being struck, <b>errors</b> are made. Because of modern technology, some types of <b>errors</b> {{are less likely to}} occur now, but that has not seemed to have a dramatic impact on values. Some types of <b>errors,</b> such as clipped planchets, edge strikes, and foreign object strike-throughs can be faked perhaps keeping down {{the value of}} some types of mint <b>errors.</b> Many <b>errors</b> are sold ungraded because of their relatively low value. Grading services often charge more to grade a coin than it is worth. <b>Errors</b> are often not noted by grading services.Overdates, mules, brockage, double denomination, and struck on the wrong planchet <b>errors</b> are often valuable. <b>Errors</b> on ancient, medieval, and higher-value coins are usually detrimental to the coin's numismatic value.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to know what area of grammatical <b>errors</b> in composing descriptive texts made by English Department students of English for specific Purposes (ESP) program class “A” University of Muhammadiyah Malang academic year 2012 - 2013. In analyzing the grammatical <b>errors,</b> the writer used the theory proposed by Dulay et al. (1981) which classify the area grammatical <b>errors</b> into four: omission, addition, misformation, and misordering. This study used descriptive research design. The research subject of this study consisted of 42 students. The writer used secondary data source because in collecting the data the writer did not collect them by herself. The result of the study showed that there were 349 <b>errors</b> made by them. Most of the area of grammatical <b>errors</b> they made was omission <b>errors.</b> The second rank was misformation <b>errors</b> which are consisted of three; those are regularization, archi-form, and alternating forms. And all of the students’ <b>errors</b> in misformation <b>errors</b> were alternating forms. Then, the third rank was addition <b>errors</b> which are also consisted of three: regularization <b>errors,</b> simple addition <b>errors,</b> and double marking <b>errors.</b> However, there was no double marking <b>errors</b> in students’ composition.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} adjustments of selective attention following <b>errors</b> and {{their relation to}} the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of <b>errors</b> in event-related potentials. We hypothesized that, if post-error adjustments reflect an adaptive mechanism that should prevent the occurrence of further <b>errors,</b> then adjustments of attentional selectivity should be observed only following <b>errors</b> due to insufficient selective attention. To test this, a four-choice flanker task was used in which <b>errors</b> due to insufficient selective attention (flanker <b>errors)</b> and other <b>errors</b> (nonflanker <b>errors)</b> could be distinguished. We found strong adjustments of selective attention following flanker <b>errors</b> but not following nonflanker <b>errors.</b> Moreover, the Ne/ERN amplitude was correlated with adjustments of selective attention on a trial-by-trial basis. The results provide support for {{the notion that the}} Ne/ERN is a correlate of adaptive adjustments following <b>errors...</b>|$|R

25|$|Term I {{accounts}} for past {{values of the}} SP-PV <b>error</b> and integrates them over time to produce the I term. For example, {{if there is a}} residual SP-PV <b>error</b> after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual <b>error</b> by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the <b>error.</b> When the <b>error</b> is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the <b>error</b> decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.|$|E
25|$|If {{the exact}} {{confidence}} intervals are used, then {{the margin of}} <b>error</b> takes into account both sampling <b>error</b> and non-sampling <b>error.</b> If an approximate confidence interval is used (for example, by assuming the distribution is normal and then modeling the confidence interval accordingly), then the margin of <b>error</b> may only take random sampling <b>error</b> into account. It does not represent other potential sources of <b>error</b> or bias such as a non-representative sample-design, poorly phrased questions, people lying or refusing to respond, the exclusion of people {{who could not be}} contacted, or miscounts and miscalculations.|$|E

In this paper we address the influence of DIC <b>errors,</b> of phase description <b>errors</b> and, in a lesser extent of stress description <b>errors.</b> Since conform meshes are used, phase description <b>errors</b> are related both to stress description <b>errors</b> and to measured displacement <b>errors.</b>|$|R

25|$|A simple <b>error</b> {{model is}} to {{introduce}} a small <b>error</b> to the data probability term in the homozygous cases, allowing a small constant probability that nucleotides which don't match the A allele are observed in the AA case, and respectively a small constant probability that nucleotides not matching the B allele are observed in the BB case. However more sophisticated procedures are available which attempt to more realistically replicate the actual <b>error</b> patterns observed in real data in calculating the conditional data probabilities. For instance, estimations of read quality (measured as Phred quality scores) have been incorporated in these calculations, {{taking into account the}} expected <b>error</b> rate in each individual read at a locus. Another technique that has successfully been incorporated into <b>error</b> models is base quality recalibration, where separate <b>error</b> rates are calculated - based on prior known information about <b>error</b> patterns - for each possible nucleotide substitution. Research shows that each possible nucleotide substitution is not equally likely to show up as an <b>error</b> in sequencing data, and so base quality recalibration has been applied to improve <b>error</b> probability estimates.|$|E
