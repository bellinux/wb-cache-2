5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as <b>election</b> <b>day</b> approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On <b>election</b> <b>day,</b> Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E

5|$|The 1985 <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> floods (also {{known as}} the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia) {{produced}} the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985. The event occurred after Hurricane Juan, a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. On November3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing a plume of moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November5 west of Washington, D.C. before turning out to sea the next day. The event was {{known as the}} <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} causal {{effect of the}} {{majority}} party's electoral outcomes on the allocation of government spending in Japan, using prefectural data from 1981 to 1999. We first articulate the difficulty in consistently estimating the majority party's influence on the allocation of government spending due to the endogeneity of electoral outcomes. The endogeneity of electoral outcomes is more serious when the majority party makes decisions on the allocation of government spending {{in order to win}} the elections. The amount of rainfall on <b>election</b> <b>days</b> offers an exogenous variation of the electoral outcomes of the majority party across regions. Therefore, we use the amount of rainfall on <b>election</b> <b>days</b> to estimate the causal effect of the electoral outcomes on the allocation of government spending. The weather on <b>election</b> <b>days</b> affects the behavior of voters in many regions, in turn affecting the majority party's electoral outcomes. We can reject the null hypothesis that the majority party's electoral outcomes have no impact on the allocation of government spending. ...|$|R
