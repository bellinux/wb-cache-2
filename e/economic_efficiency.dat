5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E

This study aimed to: 1) analyze technical, allocative, and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of dry land maize farming under ICM and non-ICM implementation program, 2) identify factors that influence the technical inefficiency of maize farming under ICM and non-ICM implementation program. The study was conducted in maize production center in West Java province at Sukabumi and Garut regencies. Stratified random sampling method was used to survey 300 households in 2015. The data were analyzed using the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production function; while allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were analyzed using the input side approach with frontier dual cost function. The results showed that the productivity of ICM maize farming was 18 % higher than the non-ICM. The level of technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of ICM maize farming were 88 %, 22 %, and 20 % respectively, while the level of technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of non-ICM maize farming were 78 %, 18 %, and 14 %, respectively. The level of technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> increased by 11 % to 30 % higher in ICM than the non-ICM.

5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Technical, scale, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are {{investigated}} by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier methods providing a decision-making tool and managerial implications {{in the measurement}} of farm business performance and efficiency. Design/methodology/approach – Technical, scale, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are analyzed with the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) sample for 13 farm business branches in Slovenia in the period 1994 - 2003. DEA models are used with an output-orientation, three outputs and four inputs. The non-parametric DEA estimations are compared with parametric stochastic frontier approach. The cluster analysis is used to identify three different farm business groups according to their performance. Findings – The average technical, scale, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the whole FADN sample over the analyzed period are relatively high (around or over 0. 90), suggesting that, although the FADN sample contains very different farms, the latter have similar management practices, and are similarly {{able to make the}} best use of the existing technology. Five farm branches (crop, dairy, livestock using own feed, fruit, and forestry) are fully efficient with respect to all four analyzed efficiency measures, suggesting that these specializations have the best chance to compete on the European and world markets. Originality/value – Studies of technical, scale, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are rare for transitional farm businesses, especially in Slovenia. The research contributes to the crucial issue of whether small family farm businesses might be able to compete on international markets, as Slovenian agriculture is characterized by such structures...|$|R

This research aims are (1) to analyze the factors that affect cassava production, (2) to measure the level of technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> (3) to identify the factors that influence the technical inefficiency in Central Lampung Regency. The study was conducted in Central Lampung Regency, Lampung Province. The purposive sampling method was used to select area study and simple random sampling technique was used to collect 78 cassava farmers in the study area. Data were analyzed with the stochastic frontier production function model and cost function dual frontier. The results shows that the land, seed,fertilizer N and fertilizer K variable significantly affected cassava production. The level of technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of cassava farming were not efficient with average technical, allocative and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> value respectively of 0, 69; 0, 71; and 0, 47.
