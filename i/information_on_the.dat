40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for color image quantization which preserves {{the shape of the}} color gamut of the studied image. Quantization consists to find a set of color representative of the color distribution of the image. We are looking here for an optimal LUT (look up table) which contains <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> image’s gamut and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> color distribution of this image. The main motivation of this work is to control the reproduction of color images on different output devices in order to have the same color feeling, coupling intrinsic <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> image gamut and output device calibration. We have developped a color quantization algorithm based on an image dependant sampling of the CIELAB color space. This approach overcomes classical approaches...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the flux of the GRB neutrino background and compute the event rate at SK and TITAND in the collapsar model, assuming that GRB formation rate {{is proportional to}} the star formation rate. We find that the flux and the event rate depend sensitively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mass-accretion rate. Although the detection of signals from GRBs seems to be difficult by SK, we find that we can detect them by TITAND (optimistically ∼ 20 events per year in the energy range Eνe ≥ 50 MeV). Therefore, we show that we will obtain <b>the</b> <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mass-accretion rate of collapsar by observing the GRB neutrino background, which, in turn, should give us <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> total explosion energy of GRBs...|$|R
