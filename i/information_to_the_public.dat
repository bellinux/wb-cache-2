Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found.

25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
