500|$|By all accounts, Gage {{appeared}} to be a fair administrator, respecting people's lives and property, although he had a healthy distrust of the landowning seigneurs and of the Roman Catholic clergy, who he viewed as intriguers for the French. When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was [...] "very much [...] of this cursed Climate, and I must be bribed very high to stay <b>here</b> <b>any</b> longer". [...] In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst's command in New York on 17 November 1763. [...] When he did so, he inherited the job of dealing with the Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion.|$|E
500|$|The Brin {{family lived}} in a three-room {{apartment}} in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother. Brin told Malseed, [...] "I've {{known for a long}} time that my father wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the United States. In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. [...] "We cannot stay <b>here</b> <b>any</b> more", he told his wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to [...] "mingle freely with colleagues from the United States, France, England and Germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were not 'monsters.'" [...] He added, [...] "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|The French {{withdrawal}} was not announced and {{was supposed}} to be secret, but the local church leadership found out quickly and the local Catholic community had already begun to move to the ports before end of talks in Geneva. By the time the accords were signed, 45,000 Catholic refugees were already waiting in Hanoi, Haiphong or Hải Dương. According to the records of the Catholic Church, over 70% of Catholics in Bui Chu and Phat Diem left, compared to around 50% in most other areas. The Catholic records claim that only a third of Hanoi Catholics left, and that around 80% of all clergy left. In all areas, a higher proportion of priests left than laypeople, which has been attributed to the communists inflicting heavier punishments on more prominent opposition figures, such as clerics. The departure rate was also lower in areas further removed from the coastal areas and departure ports; in Hưng Hóa, only 11.8% of Catholics were recorded by their diocese as have migrated. It has been speculated that the low rate of Hanoi residents choosing to depart may have been because the city was relatively untouched by the decade of fighting, and that the varying and high rate of departures among rural Catholics was due to the influence of the local clergy; priests in northern Vietnam were noted to be more theocratic and involved in civic decision-making. They used a variety of ways to persuade their disciples to migrate; some explained their belief that circumstances would be difficult for people who did not immigrate, some simply gave dogmatic reasons such as [...] "God is not <b>here</b> <b>any</b> more", while others gave no reason at all and made declarations such as [...] "We are leaving tomorrow" [...] in the expectation that their followers would obey without question. Surveys on the immigrants suggested they were largely content to follow the recommendation of the local priest. In some areas, the bishop in charge of the diocese told Catholics to stay, but laypeople were more likely to leave or stay depending on the stance of the local priest with whom they had regular contact; in many cases, such as in Hanoi, a majority of priests ignored their bishop and left anyway.|$|E

2500|$|His son's suicide {{inspired}} O'Connor {{to start}} a crusade against the man who sold the drugs to Hugh. He called Harry Perzigian [...] "a partner in murder" [...] and a [...] "sleazeball". Perzigian filed a defamation lawsuit against the actor. In 1997, a California jury threw out the case. In an interview on CNN's Larry King Live soon after the verdict, O'Connor said {{he would never be}} able to put his son's death behind him. [...] "I can't forget it. There isn't a day that I don't think of him and want him back and miss him, and I'll feel that way until I'm not <b>here</b> <b>any</b> more," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous Dutch and English sailors {{searched for}} the rocks over the centuries. The first attempt was in 1636, when two Dutch ships were sent {{to search for the}} Tryal Rocks at their purported location. Sickness {{prevented}} William Dampier from searching for the rocks in 1700; on 11 June of that year he wrote: [...] "I kept on my course to the westward till the 15th, and then altered it. My design was to seek for the Tryal Rocks; but, having been sick 5 or 6 days without any fresh provision or other good nourishment aboard, and seeing no likelihood of my recovery, I rather chose to go to some port in time than to beat <b>here</b> <b>any</b> longer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the Netherlands, he did his {{national}} service training and after that, at the age of 24, applied for a job with the Rotterdam firm of Internatio (now called Internatio-Müller). He was sent to Indonesia, where he worked in then Batavia. Later he was sent as representative to Banjarmasin, in Southeast Kalimantan, to buy rubber from local growers. This was not without its dangers in the precarious relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia in those years. The local leftist trade unions were hostile to colonial capital, of which they regarded Internatio as a typical representative. [...] In some of the violent demonstrations Ras was repeatedly threatened personally. For instance, once some workers who had been sacked used traditional medicine men to cast a spell on his house. As it became impossible to do his work <b>here</b> <b>any</b> longer, he returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, 27 October 1912, the 18-year-old Kiyoaki and Honda {{are talking}} {{on an island}} in the {{ornamental}} lake on the estate when they see Kiyoaki's mother, her maids, and two guests: Satoko Ayakura, the 20-year-old daughter of a count, and her great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. The Ayakura family is one of twenty-eight of the rank of Urin, and they live in Azabu. Kiyoaki is aware that Satoko has a crush on him, and pretends indifference to her. Shortly after they all meet, there is a bad omen: they see a dead black dog {{at the top of a}} high waterfall. The Abbess offers to pray for it. Satoko insists on picking flowers for the dog with Kiyoaki. While Satoko is alone with Kiyoaki, she blurts out: [...] "Kiyo, what would you do if all of a sudden I weren't <b>here</b> <b>any</b> more?" [...] He is discomfited by the inexplicable question, and resents the fact that she has startled him with it.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{other similar}} clashes {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. [...] Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek’s secondary objective was achieved <b>here,</b> <b>any</b> positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. [...] The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalilsts for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.|$|E
