25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: <b>Ivabradine</b> provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ivabradine</b> acts on the If (f is for [...] "funny", {{so called}} {{because it had}} unusual {{properties}} compared with other current systems known {{at the time of}} its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the sinoatrial node. If is a mixed Na+-K+ inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. <b>Ivabradine</b> selectively inhibits the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces cardiac pacemaker activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium. This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, <b>ivabradine</b> may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.|$|E

50|$|Overall, 14.5% of {{patients}} taking <b>ivabradine</b> experience luminous phenomena (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field).

40|$|Effect of <b>ivabradine</b> in {{the initial}} steps and in the {{progression}} of the atherosclerosis Purpose: <b>Ivabradine</b> reduces heart rate (HR) by selectively inhibiting the If current in the sinus node. A sub-group of the BEAUTifUL study showed that <b>ivabradine</b> reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with HR ≥ 70 bpm, suggesting a protective effect on the arterial wall. The SIGNifY study is currently testing this hypothesis in more than 19000 CAD patients. In dyslipidaemic mice, <b>ivabradine</b> improves vascular function and reduces aortic plaques area. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>ivabradine</b> may exert a protective activity by decreasing low/oscillatory shear stress, which is proinflammatory in the endothelium. This study aims to determine if HR reduction with <b>ivabradine</b> induces an atheroprotective gene expression profile in the endothelium of dyslipidaemic mice before plaque formation. Methods: 6 week-old ApoE deficient mice (n= 6), fed a chow diet, were treated with <b>ivabradine</b> (30 mg/Kg/day, in drinking water) for 2 or 4 weeks. Two control groups (n= 6) received no <b>ivabradine.</b> <b>Ivabradine</b> reduced HR by 17. 4...|$|E
40|$|Blood flow generates wall {{shear stress}} (WSS) which alters endothelial cell (EC) function. Low WSS {{promotes}} vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis whereas high uniform WSS is protective. <b>Ivabradine</b> decreases heart rate leading to altered haemodynamics. Besides its cardio-protective effects, <b>ivabradine</b> protects arteries from inflammation and atherosclerosis via unknown mechanisms. We hypothesised that <b>ivabradine</b> protects arteries by increasing WSS to reduce vascular inflammation. Hypercholesterolaemic mice {{were treated with}} <b>ivabradine</b> for seven weeks in drinking water or remained untreated as a control. En face immunostaining demonstrated that treatment with <b>ivabradine</b> reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory VCAM- 1 (p< 0. 01) and enhanced the expression of anti-inflammatory eNOS (p< 0. 01) at the inner curvature of the aorta. We concluded that <b>ivabradine</b> alters EC physiology indirectly via modulation of flow because treatment with <b>ivabradine</b> had no effect in ligated carotid arteries in vivo, and did not influence the basal or TNFα-induced expression of inflammatory (VCAM- 1, MCP- 1) or protective (eNOS, HMOX 1, KLF 2, KLF 4) genes in cultured EC. We therefore considered whether <b>ivabradine</b> can alter WSS which is a regulator of EC inflammatory activation. Computational fluid dynamics demonstrated that <b>ivabradine</b> treatment reduced heart rate by 20 [*]% and enhanced WSS in the aorta. In conclusion, <b>ivabradine</b> treatment altered haemodynamics in the murine aorta by increasing the magnitude of shear stress. This was accompanied by induction of eNOS and suppression of VCAM- 1, whereas <b>ivabradine</b> did not alter EC that could not respond to flow.

40|$|Aims. Migration of CD 4 -positive {{lymphocytes}} {{into the}} vessel {{wall is a}} critical step in atherogenesis. Recent data suggest that <b>ivabradine,</b> a selective I(f) -channel blocker, reduces atherosclerotic plaque formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, hitherto nothing {{is known about the}} mechanism by which <b>ivabradine</b> modulates plaque formation. Therefore, the present study investigated whether <b>ivabradine</b> regulates chemokine-induced migration of lymphocytes. Methods and results. Stimulation of CD 4 -positive lymphocytes with SDF- 1 leads to a 2. 0 ± 0. 1 fold increase in cell migration (P <. 01; n = 7). Pretreatment of cells with <b>ivabradine</b> reduces this effect to a maximal 1. 2 ± 0. 1 fold induction at 0. 1 µmol/L <b>ivabradine</b> (P <. 01 compared to SDF- 1 -treated cells, n = 7). The effect of <b>ivabradine</b> on CD 4 -positive lymphocyte migration was mediated through an early inhibition of chemokine-induced PI- 3 kinase activity as determined by PI- 3 kinase activity assays. Downstream, <b>ivabradine</b> inhibits activation of the small GTPase Rac and phosphorylation of the Myosin Light Chain (MLC).

40|$|Background. Inflammation plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{progression}} of chronic heart failure (CHF). <b>Ivabradine</b> is known to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with CHF under certain conditions. Beyond the reduction of heart rate, only limited knowledge exists about potential anti-inflammatory effects of <b>ivabradine</b> that might contribute to its benefit in CHF. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>ivabradine</b> on systemic inflammation. Methods. In the present study, 33 patients with CHF due to dilated, ischemic, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy were treated with <b>ivabradine</b> according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). A number of circulating dendritic cells as well as inflammatory mediators were investigated using FACS analysis and ELISA, respectively, before and during <b>ivabradine</b> therapy. Results. Treatment with <b>ivabradine</b> resulted in a significant improvement of CHF symptoms as well as an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, <b>ivabradine</b> treatment led to a significant reduction of TNF-alpha (TNF-α) serum levels and a reconstitution of circulating dendritic cells which are known to be reduced in patients with CHF.

40|$|<b>Ivabradine</b> is a {{specific}} heart rate-reducing agent approved as a treatment of chronic stable angina. Its mode of action involves a selective and specific block of HCN channels, the molecular components of sinoatrial "funny" (f) -channels. Different {{studies suggest that the}} binding site of <b>ivabradine</b> is located in the inner vestibule of HCN channels, but the molecular details of <b>ivabradine</b> binding are unknown. We thus sought to investigate by mutagenesis and in silico analysis which residues of the HCN 4 channel, the HCN isoform expressed in the sinoatrial node, are involved in the binding of <b>ivabradine.</b> Using homology modeling, we verified the presence of an inner cavity below the channel pore and identified residues lining the cavity; these residues were replaced with alanine (or valine) either alone or in combination, and WT and mutant channels were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Comparison of the block efficiency of mutant vs WT channels, measured by patch-clamp, revealed that residues Y 506, F 509 and I 510 are involved in <b>ivabradine</b> binding. For each mutant channel, docking simulations correctly explain the reduced block efficiency in terms of proportionally reduced affinity for <b>ivabradine</b> binding. In summary our study shows that <b>ivabradine</b> occupies a cavity below the channel pore, and identifies specific residues facing this cavity that interact and stabilize the <b>ivabradine</b> molecule. This study provides an interpretation of known properties of f/HCN 4 channel block by <b>ivabradine</b> such as the "open channel block", the current-dependence of block and the property of "trapping" of drug molecules in the closed configuration...|$|E

In this article, we examine currently available data related to the use of <b>ivabradine</b> in patients with angina pectoris with and without left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) or heart failure (HF). We explore results from large morbidity-mortality trials of <b>ivabradine</b> in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) without HF (SIGNIfY), stable CAD with LVD (BEAUTIfUL), and systolic HF (SHIfT). While <b>ivabradine</b> did not improve outcomes in the main population in SIGNIfY, analyses of the antianginal effect of <b>ivabradine</b> in a pre-specified angina subgroup (n = 12 049) were in line with knowledge of the antianginal properties of <b>ivabradine,</b> with improvements in angina class vs. placebo (P = 0. 01) and a trend towards less elective coronary revascularization (P = 0. 058). A post hoc analysis in a subgroup of 1507 BEAUTIfUL patients with limiting angina at baseline showed that risk reduction in favour of <b>ivabradine,</b> which was nominally statistically significant for hospitalization for myocardial infarction; the results were even better in patients with heart rate ≥ 70 b. p. m. Similarly, a post hoc analysis in 2220 SHIfT patients with angina at baseline indicated that the beneficial prognostic effects of <b>ivabradine</b> were maintained. The main differences between the three studies are LVD and <b>ivabradine</b> dosage (which was higher in SIGNIfY than in the other two trials).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Elevated {{heart rate}} is {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular morbidity. The selective I(f) current inhibitor <b>ivabradine</b> reduces heart rate without affecting cardiac contractility, and {{has been shown to}} be cardioprotective in the failing heart. <b>Ivabradine</b> also exerts some of its beneficial effects by decreasing cardiac proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting peroxidants and collagen accumulation in atherosclerosis or congestive heart failure. However, the effects of <b>ivabradine</b> in the setting of acute viral myocarditis and on the cytokines, oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis have not been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was designed to compare the effects of <b>ivabradine</b> and carvedilol in acute viral myocarditis. In a coxsackievirus B 3 murine myocarditis model (Balb/c), effects of <b>ivabradine</b> and carvedilol (a nonselective β-adrenoceptor antagonist) on myocardial histopathological changes, cardiac function, plasma noradrenaline, cytokine levels, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase contents were studied. Both <b>ivabradine</b> and carvedilol similarly and significantly reduced heart rate, attenuated myocardial lesions and improved the impairment of left ventricular function. In addition, <b>ivabradine</b> treatment as well as carvedilol treatment showed significant effects on altered myocardial cytokines with a decrease in the amount of plasma noradrenaline. The increased myocardial MCP- 1, IL- 6, and TNF-α. in the infected mice was significantly attenuated in the <b>ivabradine</b> treatment group. Only carvedilol had significant anti-oxidative and anti-apoptoic effects in coxsackievirus B 3 -infected mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results show that the protective effects of heart rate reduction with <b>ivabradine</b> and carvedilol observed in the acute phase of coxsackievirus B 3 murine myocarditis may be due not only to the heart rate reduction itself but also to the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines...|$|E
40|$|Incidence {{of chronic}} heart failure (HF) {{increases}} {{with age and}} cardiovascular (CV) morbidity. Co-morbidities increase hospitalization and mortality in HF, and non-CV co-morbidities may lead to preventable hospitalizations. We studied the impact of co-morbidities on mortality and morbidity in Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the If Inhibitor <b>Ivabradine</b> Trial, and investigated whether the impact of <b>ivabradine</b> was affected by co-morbidities. We analyzed the Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the If Inhibitor <b>Ivabradine</b> Trialpopulation, with moderate-to-severe HF and left ventricular dysfunction (in sinus rhythm with heart rate at rest ≥ 70 beats/min), according to co-morbidity: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, anemia, stroke, impaired renal function, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Co-morbidity load was classed as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 + or 1 to 2 co-morbidities, or 3 + co-morbidities. Co-morbidities were evenly distributed between the placebo and <b>ivabradine</b> groups. Patients with more co-morbidities {{were likely to be}} older, women, had more advanced HF, {{were less likely to be}} on β blockers, with an even distribution on <b>ivabradine</b> 2. 5, 5, or 7. 5  mg bid and placebo at all co-morbidity loads. Number of co-morbidities was related to outcomes. Cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization events significantly increased (p &# 62; 0. 0001) with co-morbidity load, with the most events in patients with &# 62; 3 co-morbidities for both, <b>ivabradine</b> and placebo.

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies in healthy and {{asymptomatic}} subjects, as well as patients with already established cardiovascular disease (CAD) have demonstrated that heart rate (HR) {{is a very important}} and major independent cardiovascular risk factor for prognosis. Lowering heart rate reduces cardiac work, thereby diminishing myocardial oxygen demand. Several experimental studies in animals, including dogs and pigs, have clarified the beneficial effects of <b>ivabradine</b> associated with HR lowering. <b>Ivabradine</b> is a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarisation activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated funny current (If) involved in pacemaker generation and responsiveness of the sino-atrial node (SAN), which result in HR reduction with no other apparent direct cardiovascular effects. Several studies show that <b>ivabradine</b> substantially and significantly reduces major risks associated with heart failure when added to guideline-based and evidence-based treatment. However the biological effect of <b>ivabradine</b> have yet to be studied. This effects can appear directly on myocardium or on a systemic level improving endothelial function and modulating immune cell migration.

40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{sinus rhythm}} is an {{important}} side effect of inhaled salbutamol which is especially harmful in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). Cross-over, randomized, open label study design. 20 patients (18 males and two females) with COPD stage II–IV and comorbide CHD NYHA class I–III were included. Spirometry with 400 mg salbutamol inhalation was performed at two consecutive days of the study. Patients in group I were prescribed 5 mg <b>ivabradine</b> per os 3 h before salbutamol inhalation solely {{on the first day of}} the study and patients of group II received 5 mg <b>ivabradine</b> only on the second day of the study. Salbutamol caused a significant increase of HR by 5. 5 bpm (95 % CI 0. 8; 10. 2, p < 0. 03). After <b>ivabradine</b> ingestion salbutamol did not change HR significantly by − 2. 4 bpm (− 7. 0; 2. 3, p = 0. 33). The attenuation of HR elevation by <b>ivabradine</b> was significant, p < 0. 01. Salbutamol alone increased FEV 1 by 6. 0 % (2. 7; 9. 3, p < 0. 01). This effect was not impaired by <b>ivabradine</b> (FEV 1 increase by 7. 7 % (2. 8; 12. 6, p < 0. 01 versus baseline, p = 0. 5 versus no <b>ivabradine).</b> <b>Ivabradine</b> 5 mg per os prevents heart rate acceleration after inhalation of 400 mg salbutamol. <b>Ivabradine</b> has no impact on lung function in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and CHD comorbidity...|$|E
40|$|IF : 3, 475) International audienceIt {{has been}} speculated that {{pacemaker}} current (I(f)) in human atria could {{play a role in}} causing ectopic atrial automaticity. <b>Ivabradine</b> is a novel selective and specific I(f) inhibitor in the sinus node that reduces heart rate without any negative inotropic effect. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore possible effects of <b>ivabradine</b> on I(f) in atrial myocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using patch-clamp technique, we studied effects of <b>ivabradine</b> on I(f) present in atrial myocytes isolated from human right appendages of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The identification of HCN isoforms was obtained by means of multiplex single-cell RT-PCR. <b>Ivabradine</b> induced a marked concentration and use-dependent I(f) inhibition with an IC 50 at steady state of 2. 9 microM. Time constant of block development (Tau(on)) decreases with the increase in the <b>ivabradine</b> concentration. Use-dependent inhibition induced by <b>ivabradine</b> (3 microM) was not modified in the presence of cAMP (10 microM) in the pipette solution. Multiplex single-cell RT-PCR indicates that the major HCN gene subtype detected in atria was HCN 2. HCN 4 is detected weakly and HCN 1 is not significantly detected. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Ivabradine</b> inhibits I(f) current in the nonpacemaker cell with characteristics similar to those described previously in rabbit sinus node cells, but revealed a lesser sensitivity for I(f) recorded in human atrial cell than hHCN 4 subunits considered as the major contributors to native f-channels in human sinoatrial node. A potential protection of atrial arrhythmias by <b>ivabradine</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ivabradine</b> {{is a novel}} {{heart rate}} {{lowering}} agent that inhibits If ionic current in the sinus node and demonstrates antiischaemic and antianginal activity. The aim of the paper {{was to investigate the}} effect its dose-dependent drug-drug interaction with simvastatin inhibitor HMGCo-A has on PAI- 1 blood level, heart rate and blood pressure. The experiments were performed in hyper- and normocholesterolemic Wistar rats receiving simvastatin (1 and 20 [*]mg × kg− 1 [*]bw) with <b>ivabradine</b> (10 [*]mg × kg− 1 [*]bw) during a 4 -week period. <b>Ivabradine</b> exacerbated the decrease of PAI- 1 in normocholesterolemic animals receiving simvastatin at a dose of 1 mg/kg[*]bw and was not observed to have any significant influence on the PAI- 1 values in rats receiving 20 [*]mg × kg− 1 [*]bw simvastatin. <b>Ivabradine,</b> coadministered with simvastatin given at a dose of 20 [*]mg × kg− 1 [*]bw, significantly slowed the heart rate in normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic groups as compared to the group receiving <b>ivabradine</b> alone. Conclusion. The administration of <b>ivabradine</b> to normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic rats receiving simvastatin significantly exacerbated the slowing of heart rate with no effect on blood pressure. The administration of <b>ivabradine</b> has been shown to demonstrate different effects on PAI- 1 values depending on lipid disorders...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ivabradine</b> {{not only}} reduces heart rate but has other cardiac and {{vascular}} protective effects including anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. Since endothelial {{nitric oxide synthase}} (eNOS) is a crucial enzyme in maintaining endothelial activity, we aimed to investigate the impact of <b>ivabradine</b> in low shear stress (LSS) induced inflammation and endothelial injury {{and the role of}} eNOS played in it. Endothelial cells (ECs) were subjected to LSS at 2 dyne/cm 2, with 1 hour of <b>ivabradine</b> (0. 04 μM) or LY 294002 (10 μM) pre-treatment. The mRNA expression of IL- 6, VCAM- 1 along with eNOS were measured by QPCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) and DCF, and protein phosphorylation was detected by western blot. It demonstrated that <b>ivabradine</b> decreased LSS induced inflammation and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Western blot showed reduced rictor and Akt-Ser 473 as well as increased eNOS-Thr 495 phosphorylation. However, mTORC 1 pathway was only increased when LSS applied within 30 minutes. These effects were reversed by <b>ivabradine.</b> It would appear that <b>ivabradine</b> diminish ROS generation by provoking mTORC 2 /Akt phosphorylation and repressing mTORC 1 induced eNOS-Thr 495 activation. These results together suggest that LSS induced endothelial inflammation and oxidative stress are suppressed by <b>ivabradine</b> via mTORC 2 /Akt activation and mTORC 1 /eNOS reduction...|$|E
