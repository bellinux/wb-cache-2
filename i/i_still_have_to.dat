He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{moved up}} in the world of wingmen by flying Col. Francis Gabreski's wing on a mission. I was {{absolutely}} thrilled to fly on this legend's wing...He was a tiger and went on to become an ace again. When asked who I looked up to the most as a pilot and a gentleman in all my flying, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say it was [...] "Gabby" [...] Gabreski. When he took over the 51st Wing, he asked me to move over as a flight leader in his outfit.|$|E

2500|$|A {{lifetime}} best of 61:31 {{minutes in}} the half marathon came in March 1996 in Lisbon. His only marathon that year was in New York and he came close to his best with 2:10:59 hours. The following year he was victorious at the Fifth Third River Bank Run {{as well as the}} Prague International Marathon (his first win in Europe). Among his outings in the United States that year was a runner-up finish at the Philadelphia Distance Run. He had the breakthrough of his career that November, winning the New York City Marathon race. In spite of winning in a quick time of 2:08:12 hours, he was humble upon reflection, stating: [...] "I think I'm maybe the 10th best, maybe the 20th best. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> win a couple more big ones to be the best, or maybe run {{a minute and a half}} faster and break the world record. I will try.".|$|E

I have got {{quite a lot of}} Victor Hugo done; and not I think so badly: {{pitching}} into this work has straightened me up a good deal. It is the devil's own weather but that is a trifle. I must know when Cornhill must see it. I can send some of it in a week easily, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> read The Laughing Man,[13] and I mean to wait until I get to London and have the loan of that from you.

In April 2009, the band performed {{at their first}} Coachella Festival, and despite the heat, the Friendly Fires frontman didn't disappoint fans, giving it his all: [...] "I remember having about six bottles of water next to my synthesiser. It was painfully hot, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> dance to our music and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get into it.
