5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed {{to replace the}} Chicken Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its focus}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real world event, it <b>is</b> not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{accurate}} simulation of history. Instead it <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> provide balanced and streamlined gameplay.|$|R

Each of the films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for television series set in the MCU.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of the shopping area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E

30|$|Borda and Medrank {{are used}} during the whole process, which could be {{expected}} as these methods <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> average or a median of all the others. In our case it seems that Borda’s aggregation is much more informative than Medrank.|$|R
50|$|As of 2013, Marlinspike <b>is</b> {{focused on}} <b>an</b> IETF {{proposal}} called TACK, which <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> uncontroversial first step that advocates for dynamic certificate pinning instead of full CA replacement {{and reduces the}} number of times a third party needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trusted.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> third-person shooter so that players {{can see the}} three {{characters}} change and evolve as it progresses, and that the perspective differentiates the game from others shooters in the market. The game was meant to feature narrative gameplay, in which the game was to be played without any cutscenes so that the entire story would be told through gameplay sequences only. However, the idea was downplayed as the development team realized that having cutscenes helps players to be more emotionally connected and allowed the team to create dramatic scripted sequences.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the road}} was {{originally}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> freeway, budget limitations precluded the construction of overpasses; apart from the interchanges with Highway401, Laird Road, and Wellington Street West (Highway7 and former Highway24), all junctions are at-grade intersections. There are also two railway crossings near the northern terminus, though both are for spur lines. The Hanlon is graded and landscaped similarly to a freeway, with broad flat shoulders and an open median.|$|E
5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{valuable}} show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E
50|$|Bus Driver was not {{designed}} as a bus simulator, however it is considered one. Reviewers have suggested that an inside view would improve the gameplay, however, the developers have stated that {{this is because the}} game <b>was</b> not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exact simulator.|$|R
50|$|Architecture {{is often}} argued by design {{academics}} and those practicing in <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> holistic enterprise. Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait <b>is</b> considered exclusive <b>to</b> architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.|$|R

5|$|HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the , {{which saw}} Royal Navy service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally a hunter of privateers, {{she was also}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and {{sturdier}} build {{at the expense of}} some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.|$|E
5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode {{and the ability to}} freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{is a home}} {{computer}} produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market – the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries.|$|E
30|$|Whilst {{prospective}} and retrospective {{studies have}} similar rates of conversion into published manuscripts, our {{results suggest that}} high-impact-factor journals consider prospective studies more favourably. A study examining acceptance rates to a major European cardiology conference also found prospective non-randomised study <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> independent predictor of acceptance [27].|$|R
50|$|Forthbank was {{constructed}} in 1992, {{at the time it}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> all seater stadium with plans to expand the capacity by constructing two terraces behind each goal.
