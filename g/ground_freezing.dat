50|$|Due to the {{geological}} and hydrological {{environment of the}} tunnel, {{a large part of}} it is being driven by two tunnel boring machines from north to south.

50|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>freezing</b> {{can also}} be utilized; this may be done in ice form where the ground is saturated. Systems will also work with pure rock. Wherever ice forms, the ice formation's heat of fusion is not used, as the ice remains solid {{throughout}} the process. The method based on <b>ground</b> <b>freezing</b> is widely used for mining and tunneling to solidify unstable ground during excavations. The ground is frozen using bore holes with concentric pipes that carry brine from a chiller at the surface. Cold is extracted {{in a similar way}} using brine and used {{in the same way as}} for conventional ice storage, normally with a brine-to-liquid heat exchanger, to bring the working temperatures up to usable levels at higher volumes. The frozen ground can stay cold for months or longer, allowing cold storage for extended periods at negligible structure cost.|$|E

Its cold-hardiness comes from the bulb's adaptation to freezing during dormancy. It is, however, susceptible to rot in the winter in temperate zones, a problem not present where <b>ground</b> <b>freezes</b> in winter.

5000|$|Groundwater {{control is}} very {{important}} in tunnel construction. Water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time, causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse. The most common way to control groundwater is to install dewatering pipes into the ground and to simply pump the water out. A very effective but expensive technology is <b>ground</b> <b>freezing,</b> using pipes which are inserted into the ground surrounding the excavation, which are then cooled with special refrigerant fluids. This freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil, keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the sun is}} low in {{the horizon}} {{for most of the}} year, it is {{difficult}} for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Pine, spruce and fir do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The adaptation of evergreen needles limits the water lost due to transpiration and their dark green color increases their absorption of sunlight. Although precipitation is not a limiting factor, the <b>ground</b> <b>freezes</b> during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so desiccation can be a severe problem in late winter for evergreens.|$|R
