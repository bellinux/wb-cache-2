5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance</b> because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E

To achieve an elegant appearance, the shoe's more decorative outer fabric is prominently featured, covering the maximum possible {{area of the}} shoe's visible surfaces. To this end, the sole is made of thin material {{to give it a}} minimal profile, and a margin of satin is artfully pleated around it so that the sole covers only part of the bottom of the shoe.|$|E

With its large chemical industry, China remains a source country for legitimately produced chemicals that are diverted for production of heroin and cocaine, {{as well as many}} amphetamine-type stimulants. China and its neighbor India are the leading exporters of bulk ephedrine in the world. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of acetic anhydride each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. China is also the second largest producer of potassium permanganate in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Zuchtverband für das Ostfriesische und Alt-Oldenburger Pferd e.V. ("Association for the Breeding of East Freisian and Old-Oldenburg Horses") {{was founded}} in 1986, and was {{recognized}} as an independent organization in 1988. Even after 20 years of hiatus, {{the goal is to}} produce a heavy, quality horse, responsive with an exceptionally good temperament. The unique character of the former farm horse <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance,</b> as it was the peasant farms that led such kind horses to be bred in the first place. The breeding objective these days stretches back before the horses were called to haul tractors and artillery, to when they were heavy, elegant, and impressive Karossiers.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the rule}} {{applies only to}} conduct leading {{directly}} to a final decision, and not to an investigation meant for obtaining information. In Subbiah Pillai v. Wong Meng Meng (2001), the Court of Appeal held {{that there was no}} right for the solicitor in question to be present every time the Inquiry Committee of the Law Society of Singapore, which had been convened to look into a complaint against him, spoke to a witness. This was because the work of the Inquiry Committee was investigative rather than prosecutorial in nature.

25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance.</b> Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight. Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a microfungus that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so spatial separation of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance.</b> This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them if they try to enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E

Resilience science has been evolving over the past decade, expanding beyond ecology to reflect systems of thinking in fields such as economics and political science.

2500|$|The Arab Renaissance (al-Nahda or [...] ) was an {{endeavour}} {{to reach}} a compromise between contemporary practices {{similar to those in}} Europe and a shared Arab heritage, in the hope of shaping a new vision for an Arab society in transition. The relationship between women's literary salons and the Arab Awakening, as it was also referred to, <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance.</b> Not only were meetings of literary figures {{an integral part of the}} Renaissance, but from the beginning of the Arab Renaissance in the nineteenth century, women came to realise the strong bonds between the literary-cultural, social and political, and that the literary movement was key to liberating the 'collective consciousness' from the traditional norms that had stunted their progress. Men also began to acknowledge the importance of women's emancipation to national liberation and development at this time, and there is no doubt that increased interactions between male and female intellectuals within literary circles made an invaluable contribution. One of the first men to write about the liberation of women was Qāsim Amin, an influential literary figure at the turn of the twentieth century, argued for the emancipation of women for the sake of the Arab Renaissance, as did al-Tahtawi. It is interesting to note that both of these men frequented Mayy Ziyadah's salon in Cairo. Thus women's desire for emancipation and men's nationalist dreams became the keystone in the advancement of society.|$|E
2500|$|The Encomium {{opens with}} Gorgias {{explaining}} that [...] "a man, woman, speech, deed, city or action that {{is worthy of}} praise should be honored with acclaim, but the unworthy should be branded with blame" [...] (Gorgias 30). [...] In the speech Gorgias discusses the possible reasons for Helen’s journey to Troy. He explains that Helen could have been persuaded in one of four ways: by the gods, by physical force, by love, or by speech (logos). If it were indeed the plan of the gods that caused Helen to depart for Troy, Gorgias argues that those who blame her should face blame themselves, [...] "for a human’s anticipation cannot restrain a god’s inclination" [...] (Gorgias 31). [...] Gorgias explains that, by nature, the weak are ruled by the strong, and, since the gods are stronger than humans in all respects, Helen should be freed from her undesirable reputation. [...] If, however, Helen was abducted by force, {{it is clear that}} the aggressor committed a crime. [...] Thus, it should be he, not Helen, who should be blamed. [...] And if Helen was persuaded by love, she should also be rid of ill repute because [...] "if love is a god, with the divine power of the gods, how could a weaker person refuse and reject him? [...] But if love is a human sickness and a mental weakness, it must not be blamed as mistake, but claimed as misfortune" [...] (Gorgias 32). [...] Finally, if speech persuaded Helen, Gorgias claims he can easily clear her of blame. [...] Gorgias explains: [...] "Speech is a powerful master and achieves the most divine feats with the smallest and least evident body. [...] It can stop fear, relieve pain, create joy, and increase pity" [...] (Gorgias 31). It is here that Gorgias compares the effect of speech on the mind with the effect of drugs on the body. He states that Helen has the power to [...] "lead" [...] many bodies in competition by using her body as a weapon (Gumpert, 74). This image of [...] "bodies led and misled, brought together and led apart, <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>paramount</b> <b>importance</b> in Gorgias' speech," [...] (Gumpert, 74).|$|E
