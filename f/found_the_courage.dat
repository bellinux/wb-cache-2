25|$|Armstrong {{was playing}} a gig at the Brick House in Gretna, Louisiana when he met Daisy Parker, a local prostitute. He started the affair as a client. He {{returned}} to Gretna on several occasions to visit her. Eventually he <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to look for her home {{in order to see}} her away from work. It was on this occasion that he found out that she had a common-law husband. Not long after this fiasco, Daisy journeyed to Armstrong's home on Perdido Street. They checked into Kid Green's hotel that evening, and the next day, March 19, 1918, at the age of 16, Louis and Daisy married at City Hall. They adopted a 3-year-old boy, Clarence Armstrong, whose mother, Louis' cousin Flora, died soon after giving birth. Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled (the result of a head injury at an early age) and Louis would {{spend the rest of his}} life taking care of him. Louis' marriage to Parker failed quickly and they separated in 1923.|$|E

2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage.</b> My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E

In Petrograd (as St. Petersburg was called from 1914), people were being shot without trial, and Södergran knew that several of her classmates had fled from the city.

500|$|Modern {{scholars}} have <b>found</b> <b>the</b> pleasure Romans {{took in the}} [...] "theatre of life and death" [...] {{to be one of}} the more difficult aspects of their civilization to understand and explain. The younger Pliny rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, a way [...] "to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory even in the bodies of slaves and criminals". Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles, but <b>found</b> virtue in <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and dignity of the defeated fighter rather than in victory—an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Even martyr literature, however, offers [...] "detailed, indeed luxuriant, descriptions of bodily suffering", and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{separation}} of Church and State was a traumatic event for France, this article argues that its legal product—the Law of 1905 —was and remains respectful of religious freedom. By considering the relevant literature and by reviewing the key laws and judicial decisions on the matter, this article also suggests that, for France, laïcité represented ‘the other Enlightenment’, that is to say, a moment when national identity was reawakened, if not formed anew. The piece concludes {{that the reason for}} this lies in the fact that, in 1905, France’s <b>Founding</b> Fathers had <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to distance <b>the</b> country’s bloody religious past from its legal system, thus producing a statute (the Law of Separation) and a concept (laïcité) that fostered tolerance rather than conflict. </p...|$|R

The more she contemplated it, the more did her passion --which was now both wild and deep--take hold upon her heart, eating into it like acid into steel, and graving one name there in ineffaceable letters. She could not bear the thought of parting from him, and felt, or thought she felt, that her happiness was already too deeply pledged to allow her to throw up the cards without an effort.|$|R
