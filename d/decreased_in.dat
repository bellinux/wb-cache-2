5|$|Amarillo is {{considered}} the regional economic center for the Texas Panhandle as well as Eastern New Mexico and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The meat packing industry is a major employer in Amarillo; about one-quarter of the United States' beef supply is processed in the area. The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city's international airport in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that schizophrenia {{may be due to}} an increase or a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> glutamate signaling, leading to abnormal excitatory signaling in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain. [...] Glutamate release by astrocytes has been linked to the synchrony of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may result in an increase in synaptic glutamate and a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> extrasynaptic glutamate. Administration of N-acetylcysteine leads to an increase in extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, suggesting that glutamate released from system Xc- may cause the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may cause a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors due to either a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> extrasynaptic Glutamate levels or a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> glutathione levels after the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> cystine transport. On the other hand, a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may lead to an increase in the activation of synaptic NMDA receptors due to the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> activation of Group 2 mGluRs. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> nonvesicular release of glutamate leads to an increase in expression of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, such as NMDA receptors. A disruption in nonvesicular glutamate release may affect synapse formation, lead to altered release of neurotransmitters, and could even disturb cortical migration during development. All of these seem to be associated with schizophrenia.|$|R

5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E
