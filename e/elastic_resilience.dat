40|$|ABSTRACT: Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{is among}} the top three most widely used plastics globally. Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is often added as a plasticizer by up to 40 wt % to impart flexibility. DEHP, a toxin and carcinogen, can leach into the atmosphere to cause environmental contamination. This study investigates the suitability of epoxidized safflower oil, namely Carthamus tinctorius oil (ECTO), as a PVC plasticizer. PVC films with DEHP and ECTO were compared in <b>resilience,</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus, toughness, and glass transition temperature. ECTO films displayed statistically similar physical properties of <b>resilience,</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus, and toughness at up to 30 wt%.

Cloud users usually encounter {{the problem of how to}} use the virtualized platform easily over the web without requiring the plug-in or installation of special software. The object of this paper is to develop a system and a method enabling process interfacing within an automation scenario for accessing remote application by using the web browser.

30|$|Fast curing {{stackable}} {{sealing material}} is a polymer composite with multi-component, multi-usage, and solid gel combination, and {{is composed of}} a polymer compound, foaming agents, catalysts, flame retardants and other components. The feeding sequence for making the sealing material is: A material → B material → water-cement-sand mixture → curing agent. At the same time, the sealing material was quickly mixed to a uniform status, then pressurized and sprayed. The volume of the sealing material would instantly expand to (10 – 30) times of its original volume to achieve fast sealing. This material does not contain formaldehyde, is nontoxic, odorless, and non-corrosive. During the reaction expansion process, the sealing material can fill the space and cracks in coal and rock, and has a strong bonding property. It can bond coal (rock) body, concrete, and other materials to form one solid body. It has {{a certain level of}} pressure resistance and shear resistance strength.

40|$|Bundles of polymer {{filaments}} {{are responsible}} for the rich and unique mechanical behaviors of many biomaterials, including cells and extracellular matrices. In fibrin biopolymers, whose nonlinear elastic properties are crucial for normal blood clotting, protofibrils self-assemble and bundle to form networks of semiflexible fibers. Here we show that the extraordinary strain-stiffening response of fibrin networks is a direct reflection of the hierarchical architecture of the fibrin fibers. We measure the rheology of networks of unbundled protofibrils and find excellent agreement with an affine model of extensible wormlike polymers. By direct comparison with these data, we show that physiological fibrin networks composed of thick fibers can be modeled as networks of tight protofibril bundles. We demonstrate that the tightness of coupling between protofibrils in the fibers can be tuned by the degree of enzymatic intermolecular crosslinking by the coagulation Factor XIII. Furthermore, at high stress, the protofibrils contribute independently to the network elasticity, which may reflect a decoupling of the tight bundle structure. The hierarchical architecture of fibrin fibers can thus account for the nonlinearity and enormous <b>elastic</b> <b>resilience</b> characteristic of blood clots.

40|$|Elastin, a major {{extracellular}} matrix protein present in arterial walls provides <b>elastic</b> recoil and <b>resilience</b> to arteries. Elastin {{is prone to}} calcification {{in a number of}} cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and bioprosthetic heart valve mineralization. We have recently shown that purified elastin when implanted subdermally in rats undergoes severe calcification. In the present study, we used this elastin implant model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying elastin calcification. Intense matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 2) and tenascin-C (TN-C) expression were seen in the proximity of the initial cal-cific deposits at 7 days. Gelatin zymography studies showed both MMP- 2 (latent and active form) and MMP- 9 expression within the implants. To investigate the role of MMPs in calcification, rats were administered a MMP inhibitor, (2 S-allyl-N-hydroxy- 3 R-isobutyl-N-(1 S-methylcarbamoyl- 2 -phenylethyl) -succinamide (BB- 1101) by daily injection, either systemically or at the implant site. The site-specific BB- 1101 administration almost completely suppressed TN-C expression, as shown by immunohistochemical staining, within the implants. The systemic BB- 1101 injections also significantly reduced TN-C expression within the elastin implants. Moreover, calcification of elastin implants was significantly reduced in the site-specific administration group (5. 43 ± 1. 03 μg/mg Ca for BB- 1101 group versus 21. 71 ± 1. 19 for control group, P < 0. 001). Alizarin Red staining clearly showed that the elastin fibers were heavily calcified in the control group, whereas in BB- 1101 group the calcification was scarce with few fibers showing initial calcification deposits. The systemic administration of BB- 1101 also significantly reduced elastin calcification (28. 07 ± 5. 81 control versus 16. 92 ± 2. 56 in the BB- 1101 group, P < 0. 05), although less than the site-specific administration. Thus, the present studies indicate that MMPs and TN-C play a role in elastin-oriented calcification...|$|R

Foram utilizadas 60 ratas albinas da variedade Wistar e divididas em 6 grupos experimentais. Um grupo foi utilizado como controle. Cinco grupos tiveram o membro {{posterior}} direito imobilizado por 14 dias consecutivos. Destes 5 grupos um foi submetido à morte logo após o período de imobilização, um foi liberado da imobilização permanecendo em gaiolas plásticas por 10 dias, outro foi submetido a técnica de alongamento passivo manual por 10 dias consecutivos, outro foi submetido a EENM por 10 dias consecutivos e o último foi submetido a EENM somado ao alongamento passivo manual por 10 dias consecutivos. Após os períodos de intervenção os animais foram mortos e em seguida realizados os ensaios mecânicos de tração longitudinal dos músculos. As propriedades mecânicas avaliadas foram a carga e alongamento no limite de proporcionalidade e no limite máximo, a rigidez e a capacidade de absorver energia na fase elástica (resiliência) do músculo, obtidas a partir das curvas carga versus alongamento. Observamos que a imobilização provocou redução significativa nos valores das propriedades mecânicas avaliadas no músculo gastrocnêmio. A remobilização por alongamento passivo manual devolveu ao músculo as propriedades de alongamento no limite de proporcionalidade, rigidez e resiliência a padrões controle, entretanto não foi capaz de restabelecer as propriedades de carga no limite de proporcionalidade, carga e alongamento no limite máximo. A remobilização constituída por EENM restabeleceu todas as propriedades estudadas a padrões controle.

We used sixty female albinic rats of the variety Wistar and divided them in 6 experimental groups. One of these groups was used as control. The animals of the five other groups had their right hind immobilized for 14 consecutive days. From the five groups, one was submitted to death right after the immobilization period, a second was set free from the immobilization remaining in plastic cages for 10 days, a third was submitted to the manual passive stretching technique for 10 consecutive days, a fourth was submitted to NMES for 10 consecutive days {{and the last one}} was submitted to NMES and manual passive stretching for 10 consecutive days. After the intervention periods, the animals were submitted to death and afterwards the mechanical tests of longitudinal traction of the muscles were done. The mechanical properties evaluated were the load and the stretching in the limit of proportionality and in the maximum limit, the stiffness and the capacity to absorb energy in the <b>elastic</b> phase (<b>resilience)</b> of the muscle, obtained based on the curves load versus stretching. We observed that the immobilization has provoked significant reduction of the values of the mechanical properties evaluated in the gastrocnemius muscle. The remobilization by the manual passive stretching gave back to the muscle the mechanical properties of stretching in the limit of proportionality, stiffness and resilience like the standard ones of the control group, but it was not capable of reestablishing the properties of load in the limit of proportionality, load and stretching in the maximum limit. The remobilization done by the NMES reestablished all of the properties studied like ones of the control group. The remobilization by electric stimulation and passive stretching reestablished the mechanical properties in the maximum limit and in the proportionality and stiffness, although it was not capable of giving back to the muscle its properties of load in the maximum limit, load in the limit of proportionality and resilience.

40|$|Latent {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} b (TGF-b) binding protein 2 (LTBP- 2) {{is an integral}} component of elastin-containing microfibrils. We studied the expression of LTBP- 2 in the developing mouse and rat by in situ hybridization, using tropoelastin expression as a marker of tissues participating in elastic fiber formation. LTBP- 2 colocalized with tropoelastin within the perichondrium, lung, dermis, large arterial vessels, epicar-dium, pericardium, and heart valves at various stages of rodent embryonic development. Both LTBP- 2 and tropoelastin expression were seen throughout the lung parenchyma and within the cortex of the spleen in the young adult mouse. In the testes, LTBP- 2 expression was seen within lumenal cells of the epididymis {{in the absence of}} tropoelastin. Collectively, these results imply that LTBP- 2 plays a structural role within elastic fibers in most cases. To investigate its importance in development, mice with a targeted disruption of the Ltbp 2 gene were generated. Ltbp 22 / 2 mice die between embryonic day 3. 5 (E 3. 5) and E 6. 5. LTBP- 2 expression was not detected by in situ hybridization in E 6. 5 embryos but was detected in E 3. 5 blastocysts by reverse transcription-PCR. These results are not consistent with the phenotypes of TGF-b knockout mice or mice with knockouts of other elastic fiber proteins, implying that LTBP- 2 performs a yet undiscovered function in early development, perhaps in implantation.

40|$|In this paper, a ductile and non-carbide former Cu was {{incorporated}} into diamond-like carbon (DLC) films to modify the microstructure and property of the films using a hybrid ion beam system comprising an ion beam source and a magnetron sputtering unit. The composition, microstructure, residual stress and mechanical property of the DLC films with Cu doping were characterized carefully using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, stress-tester, and nanoindentation {{as a function of}} Cu concentration. The results reveal that the doped Cu atoms had low solubility in the as-deposited DLC films. The maximum solubility was found to lie around 1. 93 at. %. When the Cu concentration was lower than this solubility, the doped Cu atoms dissolved in the carbon matrix, and the film exhibited the typical amorphous structure of DLC and showed a low residual stress and high elastic recovery due to the dissolved Cu atoms which could play a role of the interstitial atoms for stress relaxation through the distortion of the atomic bond length and angle. As the doped concentration exceeded the solubility, Cu nanocrystalline was formed in the carbon matrix, which could significantly improve the <b>elastic</b> <b>resilience</b> of the film through strain release via sliding of the nanocrystalline in the amorphous carbon matrix. It is worth noting that when the doped Cu concentration approached the solubility limit, amorphous nano-clusters were formed in the carbon matrix due to the segregation of Cu, resulting in the decrease of the number of the interstitial atoms, and thus caused the increase in the residual stress and the decline in the elastic recovery.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{experimental results}} and computational {{analysis of the}} large strain dynamic behavior of single neurons in vitro {{with the objective of}} formulating a novel quantitative framework for the biomechanics of cortical neurons. Relying on the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique, novel testing protocols are developed to enable the characterization of neural soma deformability over a range of indentation rates spanning three orders of magnitude, 10, 1, and 0. 1 μm s[superscript − 1]. Modified spherical AFM probes were utilized to compress the cell bodies of neonatal rat cortical neurons in load, unload, reload and relaxation conditions. The cell response showed marked hysteretic features, strong non-linearities, and substantial time/rate dependencies. The rheological data were complemented with geometrical measurements of cell body morphology, i. e. cross-diameter and height estimates. A constitutive model, validated by the present experiments, is proposed to quantify the mechanical behavior of cortical neurons. The model aimed to correlate empirical findings with measurable degrees of (hyper) <b>elastic</b> <b>resilience</b> and viscosity at the cell level. The proposed formulation, predicated upon previous constitutive model developments undertaken at the cortical tissue level, was implemented in a three-dimensional finite element framework. The simulated cell response was calibrated to the experimental measurements under the selected test conditions, providing a novel single cell model that could form the basis for further refinements.

Vol. 33, Suppl. 2, 2017 (0006) "The {{natural polymer}} tropoelastin is a {{structural}} protein of ECM of tissues requiring elasticity {{as part of}} their function, including ligaments and tendons. Tropoelastin has an innate capacity of self-assembly into high-order structures, and together with <b>elastic</b> <b>resilience,</b> structural stability and bioactivity bring forth pleasant singularities in adopting it as a building block to fabricate hydrogels. Moreover, easy tailoring of properties can be attained via incorporation of specific components into the polymeric network, including magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which are beneficial for on-demand therapies. Thus, the main goal of this work consisted in developing a magnetically responsive tropoelastin (MagTro) hydrogel as a platform to study the response of tendon cells to a mechanical stimulus induced by application of an external magnetic field (EMF). For this purpose, to first produce hydrogels, a solution of recombinant human tropoelastin was first freeze-dried overnight inside a mould and then chemically cross-linked inside an open desiccator via vapour glutaraldehyde. Thereafter, MagTro hydrogels were obtained through in situ precipitation of MNPs by immersing tropoelastin hydrogels in FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 solution overnight and secondly by soaking them in NaOH. Hydrogels were then analysed morphologically by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM and Cryo-SEM). Enzyme-triggered degradation was studied after 72 h at 37 oC in a human neutrophil elastase solution. Hydrogels exhibited a quick magnetic responsiveness to an EMF (Fig. 1). Interestingly, MagTro hydrogels exhibited smaller pores as observed by Cryo-SEM. This feature can be tuned according to different soft tissue requirements by controlling different parameters of the fabrication process. Additionally, the release of tropoelastin into solution decreased, which suggests the formation of a surface coating of MNPs on tropoelastin network, protecting the hydrogel from a faster degradation. Preliminary results also indicate that cultured cells are viable and spread at the surface of the hydrogel. The application of an EMF to cell-laden MagTro hydrogels will be further investigated. Overall, the streamlined fabrication of MagTro hydrogels was successfully attained and the hydrogel formulation represents a promising potential platform for soft tissue regeneration.

40|$|Elastomeric {{copolymers}} {{have been}} versatile materials {{for a broad}} variety of engineering applications of critical importance ranging from ballistic protective coatings to self-healing microstructures, possessing a backbone structure composed of alternate hard and soft segments, where the hard/soft nomenclature corresponds to the thermodynamic glassy/rubbery state at ambient temperature. The thermodynamic incompatibility of microstructures often lead to a phase-separated morphology of the hard and soft domains which can be tailored depending on the chemical composition, molecular dispersion, processing and synthesis to give a variety of physical properties. The mechanical behavior of elastomeric copolymers is hence governed by the chemical composition {{as well as the}} morphology providing a hybrid performance by virtue of simultaneous contributions from constituent homopolymers often offering new and unique properties. In this research, the mechanics and physics of large deformation behavior of elastomeric copolymers are addressed in terms of their resilience and dissipation involving elastomeric "segmented" copolymers and elastomeric "ionic" copolymers. The presence of hard and soft domains yields to multiple molecular relaxations and hence multiple viscous dissipation mechanisms in elastomeric copolymers. In addition to the viscous dissipation, stretch-induced softening due to microstructural evolution revealed via x-ray scattering observation during deformation provides another major dissipation pathway. Furthermore the segmented copolymers exhibit a substantial shape recovery upon unloading in tandem with a remarkable amount of hysteresis. A microstructurally-informed constitutive model is proposed to address the main features of mechanical behavior of exemplar copolymers under a variety of loading conditions, employing multiple micro-rheological mechanisms representing hard and soft domains. The proposed model was found to be capable of capturing the salient features of resilient yet dissipative stress-strain behavior of materials at a wide range of strains and strain rates. The model was then furthered to examine the effect of weight fraction, morphology and segmental dynamics of hard and soft microstructures. Next, the resilience and dissipation in elastomeric segmented copolymers are examined in their connections to shape recovery under microindentation testing in experiments and numerical simulations. Numerical simulations imparting the proposed constitutive model were found to be capable of capturing the microindentation behavior of materials including force-displacement capable of capturing the microindentation behavior of materials including force-displacement responses under complicated loading scenarios. Additionally, the microindentation behavior revealed a substantial shape recovery of indented surfaces which was due to inelastic flow beyond <b>elastic</b> <b>resilience.</b> The elastically- and inelastically-driven shape recovery provides critical insight into a better understanding of shape memory, recovery and self-healing mechanisms in this class of segmented elastomers. The extreme nature of elastomeric copolymers under harsh mechanical environments is then addressed via Taylor impact testing, where an ultrafast deformation event is incurred. Numerical simulations of Taylor impact behavior of elastomeric copolymers are compared to experimental results in terms of overall and localized deformation profiles, revealing a three-dimensional capability of our framework under dynamic, inhomogeneous deformation field. Furthermore, energy dissipation under such an extreme event is examined by comparison to that found in "model" glassy and rubbery polymers revealing that copolymeric materials enable a highly recoverable, protective composite architecture for shock and ballistic mitigation by taking advantages of hybrid performance of glassy and rubbery polymers. Lastly, the mechanics of elastomeric "ionic" copolymers is addressed for a broad understanding of their resilience, dissipation and shape recovery under a wide range of mechanical loading conditions. Our viscoelastic-viscoplastic constitutive framework is further developed to address the large deformation behavior of ionic elastomers including ethylene methacrylic acid (EMAA) copolymer and its chemically-modified counterparts which are recently finding new avenues towards multi-functional soft materials involving their self-healing ability under severe deformation events. This study provides a simple yet intuitive framework to rationalize physically-sound deformation mechanisms of diverse elastomeric copolymers by employing a combination of novel modeling, experimentation and computation. Finally, potential topics for further research, to which the present work can directly contribute, are discussed {{in a wide variety of}} engineering contexts. by Hansohl Cho. Thesis: Ph.
