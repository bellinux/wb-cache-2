50|$|There may be local rules {{pertaining}} {{to the use of}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys.</b> In some parts of the world, surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> alone are not legally sufficient signaling devices, and one of the international diver down flags (in an appropriate size), might be required while drift diving.|$|R

25|$|Western Channel Pile Light was {{established}} in 1924, replacing a <b>marker</b> <b>buoy,</b> together with Eastern Channel Pile Light.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, Tideland Signal {{provided}} SB‐30 lateral <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{and three}} DM‐390 buoys for {{use during the}} Vancouver Winter Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|Accessories - Their {{accessories}} line includes dive torches, knives, Surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> diving sportswear, bags, weight belts, hangers, dry boxes etc.|$|R
50|$|Boats {{that have}} come off their {{moorings}} are not normally classified as wreck as {{they have not been}} abandoned without hope of recovery. Also, <b>buoys</b> including <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> mooring buoys etc., other than those that are fishing equipment, are not normally classed as wreck.|$|R
50|$|An anchor {{may be used}} to moor {{the boat}} during the dive, or if {{conditions}} allow, it may be towed as a large surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shotline: A line {{connecting}} a {{shot weight}} to a <b>marker</b> <b>buoy,</b> used to mark a dive site {{and provide a}} vertical reference for descent and ascent.|$|R
5000|$|A {{temporary}} <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> set by danlayers during minesweeping {{operations to}} indicate the boundaries of swept paths, swept areas, known hazards, and other locations or reference points.|$|R
2500|$|... {{a surface}} <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> or other surface {{detection}} aid may be standard equipment {{in some regions}} to allow the surface crew and boats to monitor the diver's position.|$|R
5000|$|A delayed surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (DSMB), {{decompression}} buoy or deco buoy {{is similar}} to a surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> but is deployed whilst the diver is submerged and generally only {{towards the end of the}} dive. The buoy marks the diver's position underwater so the boat safety cover can locate the diver even though the diver may have drifted some distance from the dive site while doing decompression stops. A reel and line connect the buoy on the surface to the diver beneath the surface. Alternative means of marking one's position while doing decompression stops are diving shots and decompression trapezes.|$|R
25|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> line {{may be used}} {{to signal}} to the diver below, either by pre-arranged pull signals, or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and {{carrying}} a message.|$|R
25|$|Use {{of surface}} marker buoys: A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> {{is useful to}} {{indicate}} {{the position of the}} diver to people on the surface. Control of line tension is important to prevent entanglement and snagging.|$|R
50|$|The reef {{leads to}} a sandy seabed between 15 and 20 meters off the shore. Water sports {{activity}} {{take place on the}} spot, especially jet skies during the summer months and therefore divers are advised to use <b>marker</b> <b>buoy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|DSMB - (Delayed, or {{deployable}} surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy),</b> {{which is}} inflated {{at the start}} of, or during the ascent, to indicate {{the position of the}} divers to the surface team, and as a signal that the divers are ascending.|$|R
25|$|A surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> (SMB) {{tethered}} to a diver is usually towed on {{a thin line}} attached to a reel, spool or other device which allows the diver to control the line length, so that excessive slack line can be avoided.|$|R
50|$|Despite an {{extensive}} search, no trace was ever found of the vessel. Her stern emergency <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> washed ashore {{on the coast}} of Khan Yunis, an Arab town southwest of Gaza, just over a year later, on 9 February 1969.|$|R
25|$|The purge button is {{also used}} by {{recreational}} divers to inflate a delayed surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> or lifting bag. Any time that the purge button is operated, the diver {{must be aware of}} the potential for a freeflow and be ready to deal with it.|$|R
50|$|Methods of {{attracting}} help include shouting, waving a straight arm, flag or surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoy,</b> blowing a whistle, flashing or swinging a torch/flashlight at night, or using a strobe at night. Cylinder powered, high-pressure gas whistles may be effective {{even over the}} sound of engines.|$|R

50|$|The seine netting method {{developed}} in Denmark. Scottish seining ("fly dragging") was a later modification. The original procedure {{is much the}} same as fly dragging except for the use of an anchored <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> when hauling, and closing the net and warps and net by winch.|$|R
25|$|A {{group of}} moored surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{may be used}} to demarcate an area in which diving is taking place. This {{is more likely to be}} used by commercial, {{scientific}} or public service divers to cordon off a work or search area, or an accident or crime scene.|$|R
50|$|After a {{submarine}} became {{entangled in the}} net, a <b>marker</b> <b>buoy</b> attached to the net drifted along the water's surface indicating an enemy below. The first example of indicator nets causing {{the destruction of a}} U-boat occurred at Dover when the U-8 became entangled on March 4, 1915.|$|R
