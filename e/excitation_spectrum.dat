He visited the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego, and then enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. There, he taught physics classes as a Teaching Assistant and carried on independent research; he also joined in the protests against the Vietnam War and was President of the Association of Foreign Students. He received his doctorate in physics from Virginia in 1971 with a thesis on Theory of the Elementary <b>Excitation</b> <b>Spectrum</b> of Superfluid Helium: the Roton Lifetime, extending his planned stay in the US by a year in order to continue his research. Returning to Spain he became a lecturer in solid-state physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid, UAM, and then in 1975 he became a Professor at Complutense University. During these years he published more than 30 articles. For a time he worked as assistant to Nicolás Cabrera, whom he had met when Cabrera was Professor at the University of Virginia. The last PhD dissertations that he directed were in the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Two obvious {{emissions}} are observed from the ZnS clusters encapsulated in zeolite-Y. The emission around 355 nm is sharp and weak, locating {{at the onset}} of the absorption edge. The band around 535 nm is broad, strong and Stokes-shifted. Both the two emissions shift to blue and their intensities firstly increase then decrease as the loading of ZnS in zeolite-Y or clusters size decreases. Through investigation, the former is attributed to the excitonic fluorescence, and the latter to the trapped luminescence from surface states. The cluster size-dependence of the luminescence may be explained qualitatively by considering both the carrier recombination and the nonradiative recombination rates. Four peaks appearing in the <b>excitation</b> <b>spectra</b> are assigned to the transitions of 1 S- 1 S, 1 S- 1 P, 1 S- 1 D and surface state, respectively.
