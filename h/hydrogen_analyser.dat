40|$|Determination of {{hydrogen}} in solids {{such as high}} strength steels or other metals in the ppb or ppm range requires hot-extraction or melt-extraction. Calibration of commercially available hydrogen analysers is performed either by certified reference materials CRMs, often having limited availability and reliability or by gas dosing for which the determined value significantly depends on atmospheric pressure {{and the construction of}} the gas dosing valve. The sharp and sudden appearance of very high gas concentrations from gas dosing is very different from real effusion transients and is therefore another source of errors. To overcome these limitations, an electrochemical calibration method for hydrogen analysers was developed and employed in this work. Exactly quantifiable, faradaic amounts {{of hydrogen}} can be produced in an electrochemical reaction and detected by the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>analyser.</b> The amount of hydrogen is exactly known from the transferred charge in the reaction following Faradays law; and the current time program determines the apparent hydrogen effusion transient. Random effusion transient shaping becomes possible to fully comply with real samples. Evolution time and current were varied for determining a quantitative relationship. The device was used to produce either diprotium (H- 2) or dideuterium (D- 2) from the corresponding electrolytes. The functional principle is electrochemical in nature and thus an automation is straightforward, can be easily implemented at an affordable price of 1 - 5 % of the hydrogen analysers price.

40|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} {{is often}} a catastrophic phenomenon of machine elements failure under cyclic stresses. This hydrogen is generated {{as a result of}} tribo-chemical and mechanical actions on the working surfaces. This hydrogen can have three different zones or stages of behaviour under tribo-mechanical actions. Firstly, it can strongly adsorb on the mating surfaces at a shallow subsurface zone and take up the load in the boundary-lubricating regime and reduce the coefficient of friction. At a second stage, it can diffuse to the deep subsurface zone where it might work together with Hertzian stresses and embrittle the subsurface zone. The last zone of hydrogen activity is the bulk of the bearing steel where it is known to collect under the action of tensile stresses and degrade the bearing steel and hence resulting in catastrophic failure. It is important and interesting to follow up the presence of hydrogen in these zones in order to predict the safe functioning of the machine elements. In addition to this a clear distinction must be made between the internal hydrogen embrittlement and environmental hydrogen embrittlement. Two important behaviours of hydrogen are studied and quantification was made by a melting sample technique. Dependence of hydrogen diffusion on the variation of tribo-mechanical action is shown in this work. This was done by studying the pure rotating bending, rotating bending with combination of sliding and rolling motion of the mating surfaces and uni-axial tensile experiments in pure water environment to see the diffusion of hydrogen into or out of the AISI- 52100 bearing steel and in silver steel. Two different approaches were adopted in order to investigate the presence of hydrogen in three zones under the action of different stress states. The two techniques are melting sample technique by using <b>hydrogen</b> <b>analyser</b> and elastic recoil detection analysis, an ion beam technique. It is believed until now that hydrogen spread is homogeneous in the bearing steel. The results obtained showed that the inherent amount of hydrogen in steel samples is non-homogeneous and it was learnt that inherent amount of hydrogen in the steel samples is very important in order to support the boundary lubrication by hydrogen. Content of hydrogen in the steel samples showed a relation to the increasing number of cyclic stresses. The sliding-rotating bending stress state showed a considerable wear of the surfaces but the content of hydrogen was not very high in that sample when compared to the samples that were run under pure rotating bending stress state.

40|$|The hydrogen-absorbing {{intermetallic}} compound LaNi 5 was activated using volumetric apparatus (a HTP 1 -V volumetric <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>analyser)</b> at 333 K. Pressure-composition isotherms (PCIs) were measured {{through the first}} 8 hydrogenation cycles and show considerable change in the hydrogen absorption behaviour through the activation process. A series of isotherms at temperatures in the range 308 – 413 K were also measured. The higher temperature measurements show {{a clear indication of}} the formation of an intermediate phase between the solid solution phase and hydride phase.

40|$|The High Acceptance Recoil Polarimeter (HARP) {{is a new}} {{polarimeter}} detector {{which is}} based on the recoil principle, using liquid <b>hydrogen</b> as an <b>analyser.</b> With the analysing power, A sub y well known for n-p and p-p scattering, the asymmetry from the incoming nucleon flux and the normal polarisation variable, P sub 0 sup y can be determined in a sup 2 H(e, e'n-vector) reaction. The sup 2 H(e, e'n-vector) experiment which was performed at NIKHEF, Amsterdam which utilised HARP as means to detect the polarisation of the neutron took place late in 1997. This thesis documents my involvement in the building and testing of this new detector system, my participation {{in the development of the}} data-acquisition software and in a commissioning experiment which took place at NIKHEF in November 1996 involving HARP. My work at ISN Grenoble on the analysis of the wire chamber information from the commissioning experiment is also documented. An overview of the HARP detector and its components are described and their performance under experimental conditions are documented. In addition, the experimental hall at NIKHEF, Emin, is also described. This thesis also describes the running of the sup 2 H(e, e'n-vector) experiment, the set-up at the experimental hall at NIKHEF and the problems encountered during this experiment involving the failure of the electron beam and the wire chambers of the HARP detector. A novel analysis method to extract as much information as possible in the absence of wire chamber data and with the reduced beam time of the experiment is presented where a value of 0. 03 for P sub 0 sup y is found...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIron oxide {{has been}} widely used as an oxygen carrier {{material}} (OCM) for hydrogen production by chemical looping due to its favourable thermodynamic properties. In spite of this, iron oxide loses much of its activity after redox cycling mainly due to sintering and agglomeration. Perovskites, such as La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 FeO 3 -δ (LSF 731), have been suggested as potential candidate OCMs for hydrogen production due to their excellent oxygen transport properties and stability under cycling. However, hydrogen production per cycle for a similar carrier weight is lower than with iron oxide. This work proposes the use of composite OCMs made of iron oxide clusters embedded in an LSF 731 matrix. The perovskite matrix facilitates oxygen transport to the iron oxide clusters while preventing agglomeration. Two preparation methods, mechanical mixing and a modified Pechini method, were used to obtain composite materials with different iron oxide weight fractions, 11 and 30 wt. %. The reactivity of these OCMs was studied in a thermogravimetric <b>analyser.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> production and carrier stability were investigated in a microreactor over 25 redox cycles while periodically feeding carbon monoxide and water {{in order to produce}} carbon dioxide and hydrogen in separate streams. Hydrogen production was stable over 25 cycles for LSF 731 and the composite OCM with 30 wt. % iron oxide produced by the modified Pechini method but iron oxide particles alone underwent a decrease in the hydrogen production with cycling. The hydrogen production during the 25 th cycle was eight times higher for the composite material than for iron oxide alone and four times higher than for LSF 731. The hydrogen production was therefore also higher than that expected from a simple combination of the iron oxide and LSF 731 alone, indicating a synergetic effect whereby the LSF 731 may have a higher effective oxygen capacity when {{in the form of the}} composite material...|$|R
40|$|Le but de la présente étude était d'étudier l'impact de la {{variation}} des niveaux d'eau d'un marais d'eau douce (Baie Saint-François, Québec) sur l'évolution des concentrations et des flux d'hydrogène, monoxyde de carbone, méthane et dioxyde de carbone. Une approche originale impliquant l'association d'un gradient de concentration de ces composés sur un profil vertical de 1, 5 m au transfert de flux turbulent micrométéorologique fut utilisée pour la détermination des flux. L'étude démontre qu'une hausse du niveau d'eau d'un bassin versant alimentant une zone humide influence les flux de méthane, de monoxyde de carbone d'hydrogène et de dioxyde de carbone. En conditions submergées, le marais émettait du méthane et du monoxyde de carbone et consommait moins d'hydrogène troposphérique. Ainsi, cette étude démontre que des mesures in situ peuvent servir à inférer des scénarios d'impacts possibles des changements climatiques et des variations des niveaux d'eau sur les émissions des gaz à effets de serre dans l'écosystème du fleuve Saint-Laurent. Wetlands {{are known}} for their great biodiversity and the important carbon reservoir that they represent. Moreover, in the global warming context, these ecosystems represent net sources or sinks for different greenhouse gases depending of their conditions. For instance, flooded conditions favour methane production whereas they prevent hydrogen and carbon monoxide soil consumption. Baie Saint-François is a freshwater wetland that opens onto Lake Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence River) where water levels are subject to important fluctuations due to natural processes and human activities (hydroelectricity and navigation). This study was done in order {{to assess the impact of}} the Lake Saint-Pierre water level variations on the tropospheric methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide dynamics over the wetland. Knowledge of these dynamics should provide indications about the possible effects of the decreasing or increasing water level associated with the global warming on the production or consumption of these trace gases. Studies were carried out between June and August 2003 in Baie Saint-François where soil was subjected to successions of flooded and dry conditions. Water and carbon dioxide fluxes were obtained with a Bowen ratio micrometeorological station including a high frequency single infrared gas <b>analyser.</b> <b>Hydrogen,</b> carbon monoxide and methane fluxes were estimated with the modified Bowen method, their vertical concentration gradients (1. 5 m) were measured over the plant canopy. The Bowen Ratio station was equipped with different probes to measure parameters such as net radiations, soil heat fluxes and vertical temperature gradients. The turbulent transfer coefficient (k) obtained every 20 min was assumed equal for heat, water vapour and trace gases. Hence, fluxes calculations were done by the multiplication of the turbulent transfer coefficients with the vertical concentration gradients of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. The instrument used to detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane was a RGA 5. This analyser has two detectors: the reductive gas detector (RGD) for hydrogen and carbon monoxide and a flame ionisation detector (FID) for methane. The RGD contains an HgO bed wherein oxygen reacts with reductive gases resulting in Hg° releases detectable by differential UV absorbance. Chemicals were detected continuously in 10 min cycles with an analytical reproducibility of ± 0. 2, 0. 3 and 2 % for hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Generally, vertical concentration gradients measured were greater than these limits. A calibration gas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane at 4940, 1000 and 1000 ppbv respectively in nitrogen was analysed daily to verify calibration. To ensure data integrity, linearity of the instrument was assayed by several dilutions of the standard gas and the integration of the curves gave a correction factor for hydrogen (18 %) and carbon monoxide (13 %). An intercomparison with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) was done to corroborate these correction factors. Background carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide levels were in agreement with literature values. However, hydrogen was low, as observed by other investigators in summertime, since this season is related to minimal concentrations. Methane followed a diurnal cycle where maximum levels were observed during nighttime. In wet conditions, these nocturnal peaks reached occasionally 4000 ppbv and could be explained by specific production mechanisms and diurnal changes of vertical mixing in the boundary layer. Sensitivity of the processes responsible for methane and carbon monoxide cycling was seen between July 21 st and 26 th where a rain episode (total precipitation of 33. 2 mm) increased their background concentrations. It seems that this precipitation was enough to favour methanogenesis and inhibit tropospheric CO and CH 4 consumptions by a reduction of the diffusion of these chemicals into the soil. Our results demonstrated that four to eleven days following a variation of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level, a change in the tropospheric hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane concentrations was observed. This lag might be explained by the distance between the lake and the research station (about 1. 5 km) and the required time for the adaptation of soil microorganisms to the disruption of their environment. The concentration variations of these chemicals resulted from the inhibition of the processes responsible for their consumption or the activation of the processes accountable for their production. In June, the wetland was flooded and the CO 2 median flux was - 56. 5 g m- 2 d- 1. Fluxes increased significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 01) in July to 5. 30 g m- 2 d- 1, possibly due to dry conditions. Indeed, absence of water favours the activity of soil aerobic microorganisms which might produce more carbon dioxide than the quantity used by plants during photosynthesis. Methane was produced in June where the median flux was 54 mg m- 2 d- 1. These emissions were caused by the presence of water which maintained anaerobic conditions in the sediments, a suitable environment for methanogenic microorganisms. July was characterised by dry conditions, which generated aerobic environments in soils, an unfavourable microniche for methanogens. Therefore, methane median fluxes decreased significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) to 0. 011 mg m- 2 d- 1 in July. In August, before the end of the investigation period, water levels had increased but methane fluxes were not significantly higher than in July. Moreover, in this period, methane concentrations tended to increase, showing that after an augmentation of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level, Baie Saint-François flooding area could represent a methane source. During summer 2003, Baie Saint-François acted as a net source of carbon monoxide. In June, the median flux was 21 µg m- 2 d- 1 due to presence of water which inhibited consumption by soil. Emissions were significantly (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) lower in July (15 µg m- 2 d- 1) due to the absence of water, which represented a suitable environment for microorganisms consuming tropospheric carbon monoxide. In August, the median carbon monoxide flux attained 65 µg m- 2 d- 1 due to an increase of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level. Net carbon monoxide emissions observed in wet and dry conditions might be due to the high organic content in soil and water in addition to the presence of plants since all of these are subjected to photooxidation, generating this pollutant. Therefore, an increase of the Lake Saint-Pierre water level is associated with an augmentation of tropospheric carbon monoxide due to the inhibition of the processes responsible of its consumption. A decline in the water level might result in the activation of the soil microorganisms (or abiotic hydrogenases) able to consume tropospheric hydrogen. At the beginning of the campaign (June), the median hydrogen flux was weak (- 1. 37 g m- 2 d- 1) due to the presence of water. However, a net soil consumption was seen in July, where the median hydrogen flux decreased to - 125 g m- 2 d- 1. The Lake Saint-Pierre water level increase observed in August was associated with a significant (Mann-Whitney, α= 0. 05) augmentation of the hydrogen median flux to 299 g m- 2 d- 1. Consequently, a rise in the Lake Saint-Pierre water levels induced an inhibition of the processes responsible of the tropospheric hydrogen consumption. This study illustrated that the water level fluctuations of the Lake Saint-Pierre have an impact on the H 2, CO, CH 4 and CO 2 dynamics over the surrounding wetlands. When the Lake Saint-Pierre water level decreased, the wetlands acted as a carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide source, but as a consumer of tropospheric hydrogen and a minor source of methane...|$|R
