This {{led to the development}} of constructions with a relatively horizontal guider and a very <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> of the columns in the ground. Collision tests on a real scale took place at a standardization crashing angle of 20. About 5 years practical experience proved that these trial were a reasonably correct reflection of reality...|$|E
40|$|The article {{gives an}} account {{of the results of the}} {{constructed}} generalized mathematical model of fixation of cargo with pads jointly with flexible and thrust fastening elements. Developed for the first time the generalized mathematical model of collateral fixation of cargo with padding by flexible and thrust elements made it possible to identify the conditions providing workability of thrust bars together with pre twisted fastening wires and cargo pads. It should be emphases that it is only when these conditions are not fulfilled that elastic forces of <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> elements are engaged in work on retaining cargo from shifting. The distinguishing characteristics of generalized model under the action of spatial force system as compared to specific models is manifested in its ability to provide workability of <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> elements together with thrust bars and cargo pads according to the criterion of normative value of longitudinal (or lateral) load on a fastening component and allowable pressing tension of the most loaded of the used pads. The investigation results concerning cargo transported by and unprovided for in Specification [3] are now available for researchers and can be looked upon as a new stage in the development of this problem...|$|E

It {{should be noted that the}} theoretical analysis of the application of mathematical modeling is often based on highly idealized assumptions. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is the experimental analysis of dynamic effects of selected <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> structures without baseplates. Forces induced by the passage of trains have been simulated on a specially prepared samples using inertial exciter. Additional measurements of the dynamic response of structures to shock induced by a modal hammer were also performed. Measurements were performed in the laboratory of ÚPKO and ÚŽKS and in situ...|$|E
50|$|The raganella {{is about}} the size of a breadbox and {{consists}} of a wooden frame into which are fastened four or five stiff but <b>flexible</b> wooden tines <b>fastened</b> to one side of the frame; the other ends of the tines are struck in rapid succession by a cog-wheel that is turned by a crank handle mounted on the side of the frame.|$|R

The plate is hit alternatively {{on each side}} by rubber or wooden beaters mounted on a clock spring. A tremolo is the normal effect, and thumb pressure on the free end of the plate alone changes the pitch, resulting in a glissando from note to note...It is usually employed as an abstract effect, since it is notoriously difficult to play specified pitches with any accuracy—the thumb pressure to sharpen or flatten is extremely subtle and difficult to gauge...The sound is quite clangy, a cross between the smoothness of a musical saw and a poor glockenspiel.|$|R
500|$|The {{floating}} section {{consists of}} a steel box girder placed on top of ten floating pontoons. The pontoon section is anchored only at both ends, on the underwater foundation at Kauvaskallen and on Flatøy. It is <b>fastened</b> using <b>flexible</b> plate connections <b>fastened</b> by bolts and cables under tension. These are flexible around the horizontal axis at right angles towards the axis of the bridge, allowing for deformation caused by the tide. The fastening on Flatøy {{consists of a}} massive concrete block [...] long and [...] tall which was poured into a blast-out foundation pit in bedrock. Vertical pretension rock anchors have also been installed, with 12 at Klauvaskallen and 14 at Flatøy, giving [...] of support, although they were only built to increase the safety factor.|$|R
40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model of fixation of cargo with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model of cargo fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model of cargo with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means of cargo on rolling stock. In particular, {{on the basis of this}} model there can be obtained the technology models of joint work of flexible and elastic fastening means of cargo without pads of fastening flexible elements of cargo with pads without thrust bars and also <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> elements of cargo without pads and thrust bars at asymmetrical and/or symmetrical allocation of cargo in the wagon. A specific feature (novelty feature) of the proposed dynamic model is inclusion into the model of both cargo pads and thrust bars which are nailed to the wagon floor close to the butt and lateral sides of cargo...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled steel hollow flange channel beams are {{commonly}} used as joists and bearers in various flooring systems in buildings. A new rivet fastened rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) was proposed using an intermittently rivet fastening process {{as an alternative to}} welded beams. This <b>flexible</b> <b>fastening</b> process allows RHFCBs to have greater section optimisation, by configuring web and flange widths and thicknesses. In the industrial applications of RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be fastened to supports, which will provide increased capacities. However, no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges fastened to supports under two-flange load cases. Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. The web crippling capacities were compared with the predictions from the design equations in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 to determine their accuracy in predicting the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs. Test results showed that these design equations are considerably conservative for the ETF load case while being unconservative for the ITF load case. New equations are proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges fastened to supports. Test results showed that web crippling capacities increased by 78 % and 65 % on average for the ETF and ITF load cases when flanges were fastened to supports. This paper presents the details of this web crippling experimental study of RHFCB sections and the results...|$|E
5000|$|According to Hipkins Wornum had {{perfected the}} crank, or [...] "tied" [...] double action during this year, and {{introduced}} {{it in his}} cabinet and three feet eight inch tall (112 cm), piccolo uprights by 1830. In this action a <b>flexible</b> tie <b>fastened</b> to the hammer butt and to a wire mounted on the crank lever has the same function as the dog spring from the 1826 double action. The crank lever also operated a check working against {{an extension of the}} hammer butt and raised the damper wire. This arrangement {{has come to be known}} as the tape check action, the name which is also applied to the modern upright action which differs in the form of the jack and the position and operation of the damper lever. Hipkins claimed that the [...] "facile touch gained by the new mechanism soon attracted the musical public" [...] but it was not put in widespread use in Britain even after the 1826 patent expired; he wrote in about 1880 that its durability had made it [...] "a favourite model of action for the manufacturers of the present day both here and abroad," [...] and predicted that it would eventually replace the sticker action in England, having already been generally adopted in France and Germany.|$|R
