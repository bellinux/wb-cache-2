5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E

In June 2010, she and producer Steve Morales commenced work on her unreleased second studio album. The following month, Montag filed for divorce from Pratt, citing irreconcilable differences in the petition. However, they called it off in September after confessing that the action was intended to boost Montag's ailing career. In November, they renewed their vows in Carpinteria, California. In February 2011, Montag made her feature film debut as Kimberly in Just <b>Go</b> <b>with</b> <b>It.</b> Later that year, she appeared on the VH1 reality television series Famous Food, where she competed against other celebrities for a partnership stake in a restaurant in which they worked to open. In October, Montag began writing a memoir. The following year, she released her third extended play Dreams Come True.|$|E

If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits. However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.|$|E

25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody else did {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by the focus group, Maria persuaded Sean to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> anyway, as she {{thought that it was}} better to have a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E
