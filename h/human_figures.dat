5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{generally}} rough sculptures that show considerable variation {{in size and}} {{the position of the}} limbs. They depict obese <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj has various {{so-called}} Potbelly monuments representing obese <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> sculpted {{from large}} boulders, {{of a type}} found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to El Salvador. Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis is also {{distinguished}} {{by a great}} quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill. The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis, during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> {{some of which are}} playing musical instruments. Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer, a turtle and a frog. Two <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> are depicted playing flutes, while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on preschool child conception of <b>human</b> <b>figure.</b> The theoretical part is about art imaging of preschool children. It also deals with {{its relationship with the}} development of cognition, perception, graphomotor skills and changes in art imaging development during preschool period. The practical part {{is based on the assumption}} that there is a development of preschool children´s drawing of a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> in a long-term period.

50|$|Emphasis on {{the human}} figure: The <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> {{has always been the}} primary subject matter for most African art, and this {{emphasis}} even influenced certain European traditions. For example, in the fifteenth century Portugal traded with the Sapi culture near Ivory Coast in West Africa, who created elaborate ivory saltcellars that were hybrids of African and European designs, most notably in the addition of the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> (the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> typically did not appear in Portuguese saltcellars). The <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> may symbolize the living or the dead, may reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades such as drummers or hunters, or even may be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive function. Another common theme is the inter-morphosis of human and animal.|$|R
5|$|Two temples {{dating to}} Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled {{superstructures}} {{that may have}} been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> against a scrollwork background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{all sides}} of a stela were sculpted with <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming {{a part of a}} single composition. Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found {{throughout}} the Maya region. These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with overlaid stucco sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Han luxury items {{furnished}} {{the homes}} of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such goods were often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver.|$|E
50|$|In aesthetics, the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> or <b>human</b> form in art, {{sculpture}} and other art forms involves a study {{and appreciation of}} {{the beauty of the}} human body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the body shape, including body postures - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - walking, running, dancing etc. Kant refers to the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> as the ideal of beauty. The <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> conforms very well to the law that states that form follows function, which is a result of evolution over thousands of generations.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clear the effects of <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> drawing ability and stimulus separability on categorization mode in young children. Eighty-two 5 - and 6 - year-old children were asked to draw a same-sex <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> on a 21 cm × 30 cm paper. After drawing, they were showed the category generalization tasks of schematic faces or geometric figures with five dimensions varying in two values, and required to classify the test exemplars. As a result, children with high scores on <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> drawing classified them by holistic mode rather than those with low scores on <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> drawing. Geometric figure test exemplars were classified by holistic mode rather than schematic face test exemplars. This result suggests that integral stimuli may be likely to be classified by holistic mode...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} detailed {{record of the}} methodologies, assumptions, limitations, and references used in creating the <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> model in Jack, a program that displays and manipulates articulated geometric figures. This report reflects current efforts to develop and refine Jack software to enable its validation and verification {{as a tool for}} performing human engineering analysis. These efforts include <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> model improvements, statistical anthropometric data processing methods, enhanced <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> model construction and measuring methods, and automated accomodation analysis. This report discusses basic details of building human models, model anthropometry, scaling, Jack anthropometry-based human models, statistical data processing, figure generation tools, anthropometric errors, inverse dynamics, smooth skin implementation, guidelines used in estimating landmark locations on the model, and recommendations for validating and verifying the Jack <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> model...|$|R
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|The second {{piece of}} art is Jonathan Borofsky's Humanity in Motion. Located in the glass atrium of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> walking across ten {{horizontal}} poles positioned {{at different levels of}} the atrium. At ground level, looking up at the stainless steel figures, are two more figures shaped to look like a father and son.|$|E
5|$|Watts's {{composition}} echoes J. M. W. Turner's 1843 {{treatment of}} the same topic, Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure abstract art as Watts's composition.|$|E
40|$|Background. Perseveration {{has been}} {{observed}} {{in a number of}} behavioural contexts, including speaking, writing, and drawing. However, no previous report describes patients who show perseveration only for drawing a <b>human</b> <b>figure.</b> Objective. The present report describes a group of patients who show body awareness-related cognitive impairment during a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> drawing task, a different presentation from previously described neuropsychological cases. Methods. Participants were 15 patients who had a frontal lobe brain tumour around the insula cortex of the right hemisphere and had subsequently undergone a neurosurgical resective operation. Participants were asked to draw a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> in both “hands-down” and “hands-up” configurations. Results. Eight of the 15 patients drew a <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> with six fingers during the “hands-up” and the “hands-down” <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> drawing tasks (one patient drew eight fingers). A statistical analysis of potential lesion areas revealed damage to the right anterior frontal insula and operculum in this group of patients relative to the five-finger drawing group. Conclusions. Our findings reveal a newly described neuropsychological phenomenon that could reflect impairment in attention directed towards body representations...|$|R

5|$|A {{more careful}} project was {{undertaken}} between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made {{to place the}} stucco fragments. There is evidence of multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|Bangui’s artisans’ {{market has}} {{traditional}} wares representing the art products from {{different regions of}} the country. Handicrafts include woven mats and baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a xylophone, is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and <b>human</b> <b>figures.</b> The crafts center in Bangui provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony wares.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Crane {{illustrated}} and Evans printed, The Baby's Bouquet: a Fresh Bunch of Old Rhymes and Tunes, {{which went}} on to sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies. The book shows influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites, Japanese art to the incipient arts and crafts movement. In 1889, Flora's Feast: A Masque of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks. Their later collaborations includes an edition of Alice in Wonderland with coloured versions of John Tenniel's 1890 illustrations, and the 1899 A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden.|$|E
5|$|Research in the 1960s by Eliécer Silva Celis on {{the rock}} art of Sáchica showed phytomorphic designs, masked <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> {{singular}} and concentric rings, triangulated heads, and faces where the eyes and noses were drawn, but the mouths absent. The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though {{to refer to a}} pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on the heads of the anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, <b>human</b> <b>figures,</b> and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E

5|$|Artists were {{classified}} as artisans since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food-producing farmers while able-bodied men in the cities wasted their time (among other listed pursuits) crafting miniature plaster carts, earthenware statues of dogs, horses, and <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar-officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for artisans, such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong (132192 CE) to paint portraits and produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar-official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled artisans to do the painting.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E
