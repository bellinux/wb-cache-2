Then he purchased a five-pound box of candy at the confectioner's shop, and Tom and Sam did the same.|$|E
6000|$|Lillie, as queen {{in her own}} parlor, was all {{grace and}} indulgence. Hers was now to be the sisterly rôle, or, as she laughingly styled it, the maternal. With a ravishing morning-dress, and with a killing little cap of about three inches in extent on her head, she enacted the young matron, and gave full {{permission}} to Tom, Dick, and Harry to make themselves at home in her room, and smoke their cigars there in peace. She [...] "adored the smell;" [...] in fact, she accepted the present of a <b>fancy</b> <b>box</b> of cigarettes from Danforth with graciousness, and would sometimes smoke one purely for good company. She also encouraged her followers to unveil the tender secrets of their souls confidentially to her, and offered gracious mediations on their behalf {{with any of the}} flitting Newport fair ones. When they, as in duty bound, said that they saw nobody whom they cared about now she was married, that she was the only woman on earth for them,--she rapped their knuckles briskly with her fan, and bid them mind their manners. All this mode of proceeding gave her an immense success.|$|E
60|$|As sailors, the {{men were}} {{somewhat}} better able to support the dull hopelessness of their lives than others would have been. Most of them were handy {{in some way or}} other, and as they were permitted by the authorities to make anything they could, they passed much of their time in working at something or other. Some cut out and rigged model ships, others knitted, some made quilts from patches purchased for a trifle by the warders for them in the town, some made <b>fancy</b> <b>boxes</b> of straw, others carved walking-sticks, paper-cutters, and other trifles.|$|R

In 1868, Cadbury created <b>Fancy</b> <b>Boxes</b> – a decorated box of chocolates – {{in the shape of}} a heart for Valentine's Day.

He had needles and thread, scraps of materials of many colours for making patchwork quilts, blocks of wood for carving out model ships, straw dyed various colours for making <b>fancy</b> <b>boxes,</b> glass beads, and other small articles.

5000|$|With {{increasing}} industrialization {{resulting in}} Americans {{working outside the}} home in factories, it became unfeasible {{to go home to}} lunch every day, thus it was necessary to have something to protect and transport a meal. [...] Since the 19th century, American industrial workers have used sturdy containers to hold hardy lunches, consisting of foods such as hard-boiled eggs, vegetables, meat, coffee, and pie. David Shayt, curator of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, states that “Some of our earliest examples, from the 19th century, were woven baskets with handles. A meal would be wrapped in a handkerchief. Depending on your station, a <b>fancy</b> wooden <b>box</b> would be used by the wealthy.” Tinplate boxes and recycled biscuit tins commonly were used in the early 1800s, and fitted metal pails and boxes began to appear around the 1850s. Patents started to appear for lunchbox inventions in the 1860s.|$|R

5000|$|.....In {{the former}} age {{there was an}} ideal {{business}} model {{that was based on}} a quality product. In this age the ideal business model is based on a good marketing department, as a result what we have wound up with is shit in a <b>fancy</b> <b>box,</b> which amounts to lower quality of life. But what's worse than {{the fact that we have}} seen a decline in the quality of life, is the fact the whole system has become dishonest. We now have a culture of dishonesty, everything you see and read in popular culture is an insidious attempt to make you buy something that you don't actually want. And when we participate in the insidious lie, when we believe the lie and act in the ways that we have been programmed to act we forfeit our status as free agents. We lose our souls.But there is a counter culture, that's where punk rock comes in. Punk rock is considered a style of music, but it's not. If you listen to what was considered punk 25 years ago, and compare it to what is considered punk today, it's obvious that they are totally different styles of music. Punk Rock in its purest form is an ideology. It's a rejection of the insidious lie that has come to be status quo, and an embracing of honesty in the form of anti-status quo. ..." ...|$|E
40|$|Grimsey, a {{sculptor}} whose research is {{located within the}} field of community and public art, explores the relationships between communities, their social circumstances, site conditions and the integrity of the artist and artistic production. Public art is generally associated with forms of regeneration and sites of resistance. Distinct from works created for the gallery, public art demands engagement, testing the integrity of the artist. Through a two-stage review process, Grimsey was selected to direct the Arts Council-funded St Radigunds project in Dover. Working with the architect, the landscape designer and directly with the community (one of the most deprived communities nationally), he undertook extensive consultation with local schools, community groups and the local authority. Funding in excess of £ 60 k was raised from: the Foundation for Sports and the Arts; Kent C. C.; the London <b>Fancy</b> <b>Box</b> Company; Sure Start; and Arts for All. Grimsey developed an overarching narrative for the 2. 5 acre site to integrate three artworks. Adopting the metaphor of the sea, Grimsey used this to develop identifiable places for different constituencies of the community, linking these through a rippled and sculpted landscape created from the new topsoil that this formerly contaminated site required. Further elements tackled the stark boundary fence of the new nursery, developing ‘St Radigunds Forest’ a new tree-scape made in consultation with the local schools; and ‘Live Screen’, developed as an amphitheatre for screening and performance containing a giant television and inspired by Johan Huizinger’s ideas of ‘Homo Ludens’. A simple object forms the setting for invention in the spirit of a contemporary bandstand where performances are intermittent and the ‘Live Screen’ creates a proscenium for meeting and informal play. Extending the collaborative principle, Grimsey worked with ‘Black Fish’ Physical Theatre Company and video artists to produce an inaugural event with dance, drama, film and video...|$|E

Started by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association, (TSSA), the Osborne family has been associated with the spectacle from the beginning and Chris Osborne, chairman of TSSA has seen the event take place in every weather condition, from brilliant sunshine to freezing wind-chill. And he said that each year, the organisers never fail to be amazed by its growing success and popularity. As the swim goes from strength to strength each year, the event grows with canoes, raft racing and much more before the great immersion at 11.30am [...] Come and meet your friends on the North Beach this Boxing Day, give generously to the local charities and enjoy all the fun of the beach ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have already}} told {{the reader that}} there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle it about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to <b>fancy</b> that the <b>box</b> was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of relief, {{although}} I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I understood. I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.|$|R

Not one of them can swallow three different handkerchiefs and then restore any one of the handkerchiefs called for. And it is questionable as to their ability to drink kerosene oil. Mr. Hadji Ali can do all of these things. —The Fredonia Censor, May 2, 1928 At some performances, a panel or [...] "jury" [...] from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed—that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation. Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick. His stomach exposed by his standard costume, he invited audience members to pat his stomach, allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within. One newspaper reported that Ali's feats, essentially controlled vomiting, were performed in [...] "a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness." [...] Not everyone felt the same: at least one of Ali's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act [...] "was killing their supper shows".
