Room cooling demand and <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> operation was controlled by the bulk fruit temperature. Refrigerant temperature was regulated by a computer controlled ramping sequence and a weighted average of three thermistors rather than a room thermostat. Evaporator fans remained off 60 - 65 % of the time during periods of fan cycling operation. Seasonal average fan energy savings approached 50 - 55 % when the product remained in storage for a typical length of time. Room environment conditions, product mass loss, and fruit quality were not compromised. Bulk fruit temperature was exceptionally stable as compared to fruit stored in non-fan cycled rooms controlled by traditional means. Less fan motor heat input in the fruit storage space also results in compressor energy savings. Total electrical energy savings were projected to an 18 room fruit storage facility implementing computer controlled <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> cycling.

40|$|<b>Evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, shaded-pole motors {{have been the most}} commonly used <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors {{in commercial}} refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between shaded-pole and EC motor price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motor applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new motor technology versus shaded-pole, PSC, or EC <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors in identical refrigerated display cases, are presented. Measured quantities include fan motor power, current, and power factor, as well as display case discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than shaded-pole motors. In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors. Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors with the new motors would produce a 68 % <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motors. This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{standard}} {{practice in the}} field of industrial refrigeration to design and operate systems with little regard toward part-load performance. This approach is understandable, whether viewed {{from the standpoint of the}} design engineer, plant manager or chief operator. As long a space temperature and production rates are maintained during peak periods, the refrigeration system is viewed as operating "correctly". The truth is, most refrigeration systems spend some, if not most operating hours at reduced capacity. Screw compressors back off slide valves, evaporator coils utilize back-pressure regulators (BPRs) or liquid solenoids, and condensers cycle fans. Unfortunately, these control methods do not provide the maximum attainable reduction in brake horsepower (BHP) as refrigeration capacity is reduced. This paper will discuss the application of variable speed drive (VSD, also called "variable frequency drive", "adjustable speed drive", "inverter", or simply "freq. drive") technology to capacity control of screw compressors, <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans,</b> and condenser fans.

The objective was to demonstrate the effect of cyclic and continuous variation of the operating temperature of 20 °C to- 20 °C on the appearance of cracks on the fan blades. Throughout this study, the effects of mechanical vibration have been neglected. The temperature gradient and the stress field in the material was estimated using Hoai model. Bueckner and Paris model was used to evaluate the stress intensity factor in order to determine the lifespan of the fan blades on the evaporator of the freezer rooms. The equation system chosen was solved by the application of the method of separated variables and dichotomy. The results show that the temperature field generated by either a short or long operating cycle does not have a considerable effect on the thermomechanical behavior of the fans.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Increased {{consumer}} demand for fresh fruit {{throughout the year}} has created a need for long term storage. Long term storage of fruit uses more energy than fresh market products, thus increasing production cost. Pacific Northwest energy costs and more competition for markets has made energy conservation an important factor to be considered by the fruit industry. A BASICA computer program, RLSIM, was developed to predict the transient refrigeration load throughout the storage season in apple and pear cold storage warehouses. RLSIM accurately predicted the seasonal and component refrigeration system energy demand curves during the 1985 - 1986 cold storage season. The results also indicated that the largest single energy use component is the continuous operation of <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans.</b> Simulation of a six hours on and six hours off fan cycling technique indicated a reduction of 23. 75 percent could be achieved in overall refrigeration system energy use in the cold storage warehouse. Cold storage warehouse management can be improved by using the results of RLSIM. Fan cycling schemes could be properly employed without risk of increasing fruit temperature.

40|$|Systems {{based on}} the vapor {{compression}} cycle are {{the most widely used}} in a variety of air conditioning applications. Despite the vast growth of modern control systems in the field of air conditioning systems, industry standard control is still thermostat based on-off control, in other words cycle control. This thesis proposes an approach to find the optimal profiles for the expansion valve and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> for an air conditioning system for a given period of on-off cycle of the compressor. The research will consist of two phases, the development of a simulation model and an experimental analysis. In this thesis, the profiles for the expansion valve and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> are parameterized by an S-curve equation so that the optimization problem will have less numbers of parameters. The first step is a simulation model that predicts startup/shutdown characteristics. This model is used as a tool to understand the effect that the S-curve parameters has on the system cycle efficiency. Several key vapor compression system dynamics are identified as causes for increasing/decreasing system's cyclic efficiency. Refrigerant migration and fan delay at shutdown are determined as crucial issues that {{have an effect on the}} A direct search optimization algorithm, namely the simplex search algorithm, is then used to search for the optimal S-curve parameters. Valve/fan strategies that ultimately resulted in a better superheat control are assessed as the most energy efficient.

A real time optimization method is explored and the feasibility, recommendations for a successful online method are proposed. The heuristics for the expansion valve and <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> profiles from the optimization results could be easily hard coded into any commercial air conditioning system to perform the much preferred cycle control.

40|$|In this study, a multi-variable {{extremum}} seeking control (ESC) {{scheme is}} proposed for a variable-speed mini-split air-conditioning system. The control inputs are the evaporator and condenser fan speeds, respectively, while the total power consumption {{is used as}} the feedback. As accurate model is hard and expensive to obtain for the AC system of interest in real time, nearly model-free self-optimizing control methods such as ESC is considered a more feasible solution to practical deployment. Recent development in ESC, and especially the Newton based multi-variable ESC method with online Hessian estimation provides the capability for real-time decoupling among the input channels (Ghaffari et al. 2012). Different from gradient based multi-variable ESC method, the Newton based multi-variable ESC provides uniform convergence characteristics for all the control inputs. Therefore, the Newton based multi-variable ESC is suitable for multi-input real-time optimization, especially for the case with large gain variation and coupling for different control input channels. An experimental setup is developed with a 9000 BTU variable-speed mini-split AC system (Mitsubishi MSZ-GE 09 NA 2 ̆ 6 MUY-GE 09 NA). A 2000 Watts electrical heater works as the heat load. The indoor unit of the mini-split system and the heater are installed in a 4 ’x 8 ’x 6 ’ insulated chamber. A Watt Node Pulse WNB- 3 D- 240 -P power meter is utilized to measure the power consumption of the mini-split system. To achieve the speed control of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> motor and condenser fan, a TMS 320 F 28035 based customized motor controller is used. Three RTD temperature sensors are deployed to measure the indoor temperature, the outdoor temperature and the condenser coil temperature, respectively. The data acquisition and control algorithms are implemented on a National Instruments CompactRIO platform. During the system operation, the CompactRIO reads the power consumption sent from the power meter, which will be fed into the ESC control algorithm to get the speed reference for both the <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> and the condenser fan. Then, the speed reference will {{be applied to the}} motor controllers for each motor. Meanwhile, some other measurements such as indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, the speed feedback for both the motors, etc. are also monitored by the CompactRIO. The experimental study is planned to include three scenarios of ESC implementation: 1) single-input ESC with <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> speed input only; 2) single-input ESC with condenser fan speed input only; and 3) multi-variable ESC with both evaporator and condenser fan speed inputs.

It also discusses {{advantages and disadvantages of}} using mechanical MC-ASD versus VFDs and it provides field experience with VFDs in refrigerated warehouses as well as the fixed magnet MC-ASD in wastewater and other field applications. Laboratory tests for a 50 hp fan retrofit showed electronic VFD savings at 62 %, the MagnaDrive Coupling at 39 % and PAYBACK Drive at 46 %. At $ 0. 06 /kWh and list prices, the simple payback for the VFD is 2. 4 years, the MagnaDrive is 4. 6 years and the PAYBACK is 1. 9 years. MagnaDrive has models from 25 to 500 hp while PAYBACK has models from 3 to 200 hp. Contractors to the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance have helped to install VFDs for about 300 <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans</b> in over two dozen refrigerated warehouses and to install fixed-magnet MC-ASDs in about 50 applications with about half of these controlling wastewater pumps. The Alliance has no particular field experience with the electcromagnetic coupling. The primary advantages of magnetically coupled adjustable speed drives (MC-ASD) over VFDs come from reduced maintenance, resistance to dirty environments, separation of load vibration from the motor, and less stringent requirements for precise shaft alignment.

40|$|Virtual sensors have {{previously}} been developed and demonstrated {{that can provide}} a low cost and relatively accurate estimation {{of the amount of}} refrigerant charge contained in packaged (rooftop) air conditioners. Â One particular virtual refrigerant charge sensor approach uses four surface-mounted temperature measurements to determine suction superheat, liquid-line subcooling and evaporator inlet quality that are inputs to an empirical model for charge. The empirical parameters of the model are determined using linear regression applied to laboratory data collected from the system. In previous studies, extensive psychrometric chamber testing was required at different refrigerant charge levels and ambient conditions to obtain sufficient data for the regression. This testing is expensive for equipment manufacturers and {{it can be difficult to}} find available test facilities. Â The current work describes the development of an automated open lab training kit for calibrating the virtual refrigerant charge level sensor in an open laboratory space. The developed automated training kit algorithm has the ability to modulate the condenser and <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans</b> to simulate the effects of different ambient conditions and automatically add different amounts of refrigerant. The charge level is automatically adjusted and monitored using solenoid valves and a digital weighing scale. This approach reduces the human involvement to a great extent and eliminates the need for psychrometric chambers. An optimal set of test conditions has been determined using optimal experimental design techniques and implemented as a Python application. An Arduino microcontroller is used to continuously send data from the sensors to a personal computer which is used to supervise the process, including determining when the system has reached steady-state. The training kit has been applied to several different rooftop units in an open lab space.

The model consists of the evaporator, compressor and condenser sub-model, each modeling the steady-state behavior of a particular component. To confirm the model accuracy, simulation results are compared with the experimental data from the Mitsubishi "Mr. Slim"® heat pump.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein and Douglas Reindl; 166 pp. Industrial refrigeration systems {{can be found in}} applications ranging from ice making to food processing and preservation to industrial chemical processes. These systems typically consist of many different components, each component may be produced by a different manufacturer. The operational data provided by the different manufacturers for each component is used by system designers to specify installation and operational procedures of the system. Often times, the optimum control of an individual piece of equipment results in sub-optimal system performance due to unforeseen interactions between the different system components. It is important to identify and monitor key parameters of the system, such as power consumption and refrigeration effect, in order to optimize the performance. The efforts of this research focused on modeling an operating, ammonia vapor compression, refrigeration system serving a two-temperature food storage and distribution facility located near Milwaukee, WI. This system utilized a combination of both single-screw and reciprocating compressors operating under single-stage compression, an evaporative condenser, and both liquid overfeed and direct expansion evaporators. The model was verified with experimental data recorded from the system and then used to identify alternative designs and operating techniques that lead to optimum system performance. Changes in system operation such as variable frequency (VFD) or multi-speed motor control on condenser and <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans,</b> head pressure control, refrigerant temperature control, and aspects of load sharing between compressors were investigated.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the the transient behavior of an automobile arr conditioning system was performed. The experiments were conducted on an original equipment air conditioning system modified for laboratory investigation. Qualitative results showing a clear relationship between refrigerant charge and mean clutch cycling period, and between refrigerant charge and the transient behavior of the evaporator outlet refrigerant temperature, were obtained. A five-factor, two-level, designed experiment was performed to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} clutch cycling period of the air conditioning refrigeration system to small (8 %- 15 %) changes in: condenser air flow rate, condenser air inlet temperature, evaporator air inlet temperature, compressor speed, and refrigerant mass. The values chosen for each factor were based on a nominal operating condition which assumed a vehicle speed of 60 mph, and an air conditioning system operating on maximum cold setting, full recirculation, and maximum evaporator speed. The test facility permitted the control of condenser and evaporator air flow rates and inlet air temperatures, compressor speed, and refrigerant charge. <b>Evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> speed was set at the same value for all tests, and all tests were run dry coil. For the range of variables studied, experimental results showed that refrigerant charge loss corresponded to a shortening of the mean clutch cycling period and a decrease in the variance of the mean clutch cycling period. Experimental results further showed that the transient behavior of the evaporator refrigerant outlet temperature, following each clutch engagement, was clearly a function of refrigerant charge. A parameter, Time to Temperature Turning, was defined which adequately describes this behavior in terms of time and temperature only.

40|$|The vaccine {{cold chain}} is an {{integral}} part of the process of storing and distributing vaccines prior to administration. A key component of this cold chain for developing countries is the primary vaccine storage warehouse. As the starting point for the distribution of vaccines throughout the country, these buildings have a significant amount of refrigerated space and therefore consume large amounts of energy. Therefore, this thesis focuses on analyzing the relative importance of parameters for the design of an energy efficient primary vaccine storage warehouse with the end goal of achieving Net-Zero Energy operation. A total of 31 architectural design parameters, such as roof insulation U-Value and external wall thermal mass, along with 14 building control parameters, including evaporator coil defrost termination and thermostat set points, are examined. The analysis is conducted across five locations in the developing world with significant variations in climate conditions: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Tunis, Tunisia; Asuncion, Paraguay; Mombasa, Kenya; and Bangkok, Thailand. Variations in the parameters are examined through the implementation of a Monte Carlo-based global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to a case study building layout. A regression-based sensitivity analysis is used to analyze both the main effects of each parameter as well as the interactions between parameter pairs. The results of this research indicate that for all climates examined, the building control parameters have a larger relative importance than the architectural design parameters in determining the warehouse energy consumption. This is due to the dominance of the most influential building control parameter examined, the Chilled Storage <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> control strategy. The importance of building control parameters across all climates examined emphasizes the need for an integrated design method to ensure the delivery of an energy efficient primary vaccine warehouse.

40|$|Platelet {{incubators}} provide {{temperature controlled}} environments for laboratories that preserve platelets in liquid form {{at close to}} ambient temperature. Quality and shelf life of the stored platelets strongly depend on the storage temperature uniformity and continuous movement of the platelets provided by an agitator to avoid coagulation. Incubator manufacturers usually provide assurance that temperature uniformity within +/- 1 Â°C from the set point can be attained. Â Tight temperature tolerances are achieved with a combined vapor compression cooling system and an electric resistance heating system integrated into the incubator. Â Standard refrigerants currently employed in refrigerated laboratory equipment are HFCs with high GWPs. In the future, HFCs could be gradually replaced mostly by flammable natural refrigerants of the ASHRAE A 3 group such as R 600 a (isobutane), R 290 (propane) and R 170 (ethane) depending on the cooler size and application temperature.

The baseline R 134 a system performance was experimentally evaluated at a wide range of ambient temperatures between 15 Â°C to 35 Â°C specified by the manufacturer and at 3 different cabinet set points: 20 Â°C, 22 Â°C and 27 Â°C. Attention was given to the energy consumption by distinguishing between contributions of individual components: compressor, fans, pulse heater, agitator, condensate tray heater and controller. Temperature uniformity was determined from measurements at 17 locations inside the cabinet over a 24 hour period. Subsequently, the refrigeration system was converted to R 600 a refrigerant and its performance was optimized by capillary tube size selection, refrigerant charge amount, <b>evaporator</b> <b>fan</b> speed and by replacing the electric condensate heater with a discharge gas loop. The redesigned machine required only 50 g of R 600 a refrigerant charge and resulted on average in 20 % lower energy consumption. Cabinet temperature uniformity was within the required +/- 1 Â°C for all tested conditions and uniformity of +/- 0. 5 Â°C at 15 Â°C and 25 Â°C ambient temperatures was confirmed...|$|E
5000|$|The condensed, pressurized, {{and still}} usually {{somewhat}} hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve (often {{nothing more than}} a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. Aircraft air conditioners use turbines for cooling, more efficient but more complex. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the <b>evaporator.</b> A <b>fan</b> blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own [...] "kind" [...] of air (either the hot air or the cool air).|$|R

Proceedings of the Internationa 1 Conference for Agricultural Machinery & Process Engineering October 19 - 22. 1993. Seoul. KoreaA study of heat transfer and water vapour transport {{in a large}} industrial apple coolstore was undertaken. A set of measurements was made including product cooling rates in both pre-cooling units and the bulk-storage area, <b>evaporator</b> and <b>fan</b> performance, floor and building shell temperatures, door opening frequency and air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and velocity variation with both position and time. Measurements within pallet pre-coolers showed large variations in product cooling rate, between apple cartons but this could not be attributed to any positional factor studied. The spread of data was probably due to widely differing airflows through and around each apple carton. A staggered pallet pre-cooler configuration had a 30 % faster cooling rate on average than an in-line pallet arrangement. Measurements of cooling rates within single cartons showed large variation of cooling rate with position within a carton, probably resulting from non-uniform airflow within the carton. Existing heat conduction-based models were unable to predict the level of variability of cooling rate within cartons. A multi-zoned conduction and convection model was developed which predicts apple temperature and weight loss, air temperature, enthalpy and humidity, and packaging temperature with position within the carton. Testing of the model against measured data showed good fit for air and apple temperatures, but insufficient data were available for comprehensive testing of the humidity and weight loss sub-models. Difficulties in developing methodology to accurately define the patterns of airflow within cartons were not adequately overcome, so measurements to determine airflow patterns would be required before predictions could be made for alternative packaging systems. Within the coolstore measured there was significant positional variation in air temperature and humidity associated with local heat sources (such as pre-coolers, doors, uninsulated floor, and warm fruit batches), {{and the degree of}} air circulation as quantified by local air velocities. In addition, temperature and humidity showed a diurnal fluctuation associated with the operation of the coolstore. These results suggested the need for a multi-zone dynamic model to enable predictions of both the time and the positional variation to be made. Such a model was developed which included component models for zone air, external surfaces, floors, heat generators, inert materials such as internal structural components, <b>evaporators,</b> <b>fans,</b> doors and product. Novel features of the model compared to existing models are that it estimates airflow between zones using fixed user defined pathways, rather than complex hydrodynamic models; it considers water vapour transport in detail as well as heat transfer; condensation on surfaces and water absorption by packaging are modelled; and the product sub-model both allows movement of product batches during the simulation and accounts for differences in cooling rate within a batch. Single-zone, 5 -zone, 8 -zone and 34 -zone versions of the model were tested. The 1 -zone model predicted mean thermal conditions for the coolstore adequately. The 5 -zone model which differentiated the pre-coolers and the bulk-storage area predicted measured data well for the pre-coolers, but more time-variability was predicted for the bulk-storage area than occurred in the measured data. Separate door zones and vertical subdivision of the bulk-storage area were allowed in the 8 -zone model. The pre-cooler prediction was largely unchanged and predicted vertical temperature differences were consistent with measured data, but the predicted mean temperature in the bulk-storage area was offset from the measurements. Little accuracy improvement was achieved by further subdivision (up to 34 zones), probably because of imprecision in defining and predicting interzone airflow rates. Irrespective of the number of zones, adequate air humidity predictions could only be achieved when water absorption by packaging was modelled as well as product weight loss, door infiltration and deposition of moisture on evaporators. For the industrial coolstore studied use of 5 or 8 air zones appeared to be the best trade off between accuracy and complexity. The model allows study of the effect of design and operational features on coolstore air temperature, humidity, product temperature and weight loss with better accuracy than previous models...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of a heat pipe using nano enhanced Phase Change Material (PCM) as an energy storage medium for electronic cooling application is studied. The PCM is placed around the adiabatic section of the heat pipe in which heat is absorbed and released depending on the power inputs at the <b>evaporator</b> and <b>fan</b> speeds at the condenser. Experiments are performed to obtain the evaporator, condenser and PCM temperature distributions during the charge, discharge and simultaneous charge/discharge processes. In the present study, Water, Tricosane and nano enhanced Tricosane are used as energy storage materials. The nano enhanced PCMs are prepared by mixing different volume percentage (0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 %) of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles with Tricosane. Thermal conductivity of nano enhanced PCM is measured and found to be enhanced {{to a maximum of}} 32 % compared to pure Tricosane. The effects of PCM filling volumes, fan speeds and heating power on the performance of cooling module are also investigated. From this study it is found that the evaporator temperature of heat pipe with nano enhanced PCM is decreased about 25. 75 %, which can save 53 % of the fan power compared with the traditional heat pipe. Also found that the nano enhanced PCM can store almost 30 % of the energy supplied at the evaporator leading to the reduction in fan power consumption. [URL] and Aeronautical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Supermarkets {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} energy-intensive building groups in the commercial sector, consuming 2 to 3 million kWh/yr per store (ES- 1). Over half of this energy use is for the refrigeration of food display cases and storage coolers. Display cases are used throughout a supermarket for the merchandising of perishable food products. The cases are maintained at air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 35 F, depending upon the type of product stored. The operating characteristics and energy requirements of the refrigeration system are directly related to the refrigeration load. The sources of the display case refrigeration load consist of: (1) Moist and warm air infiltration through the open front of the case [...] air curtains are employed to inhibit this infiltration, but some ambient air is entrained, which adds a substantial portion to the refrigeration load. (2) Heat conduction through case panels and walls. (3) Thermal radiation from the ambient to the product and display case interior. (4) Internal thermal loads [...] the use of lights, <b>evaporator</b> <b>fans,</b> periodic defrosts, and antisweat heaters adds to the refrigeration load of the display case as well as directly consuming electric energy. The impact of each of these elements on the refrigeration load is very dependent upon case type (Figure ES- 1). For example, air infiltration is the most significant portion of the refrigeration load for open, multi-deck cases, while radiation is the largest part of the load for tub-type cases. The door anti-sweat heaters represent a major share of the refrigeration load for frozen food door reach-in cases. Figure ES- 2 shows the distribution of display cases in a typical supermarket (ES- 2). Open, multi-deck, medium temperature display cases typically comprise about half of the refrigerated fixtures in a store (ES- 3). In addition, medium temperature fixtures and storage coolers account for roughly 70 to 75 percent of the total store refrigeration load with open, multi-deck cases contributing about 3 / 4 of that fraction. Consequently, the focus of this investigation has tilted toward the open, vertical, multi-deck medium temperature case type. Various technologies and control methods are energy efficiency measures (EEMs) that could be applied to display cases and result in the reduction of the refrigeration load and of the energy consumption of the supermarket refrigeration system. An extensive evaluation of the EEMs was conducted in order to select those that met the following criteria: (1) Near-term implementation [...] All EEMs considered could be implemented with existing refrigeration hardware and technology. (2) Potential for energy-efficiency improvements [...] Energy savings and/or refrigeration load reduction must be obtained by the implementation of the EEM. (3) Enhancement of the ability to maintain target product temperature [...] Proper operation of the display case and maintenance of the stored product temperature could not be compromised by the use of the EEM. The energy impact of a number of viable display case EEMs was quantified by performing whole building hourly simulations. A special version of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE- 2. 3) program was used to develop a model of a supermarket. The model was then calibrated using available end-use monitored data to increase confidence in simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. Defrosting is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas defrosting technique. In both defrosting modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air defrosting, where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and defrosting is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube <b>evaporator</b> by the <b>fan.</b> A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and frost deposits. The theoretical results have been validated by numerous defrosting experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the time needed for defrosting. Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air defrosting is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air defrosting is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C. The application of this technique can significantly reduce defrosting energy consumption and improve the overall efficiency of air/water heat pumps...|$|R
50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the <b>evaporator</b> unit. A <b>fan</b> blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|R
