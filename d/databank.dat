40|$|Nowadays, {{biologists}} use {{a number}} of large biological <b>databanks</b> to find relevant information for their research. Users of these <b>databanks</b> face {{a number of}} problems. One problem is that users are required to have good knowledge about the contents, implementations and conceptual models of many <b>databanks</b> {{to be able to}} ask precise and relevant questions. Further, the terminology that is used in the di#erent <b>databanks</b> may be different. Also, when asking complex queries to multiple <b>databanks,</b> users need to construct a query plan on their own possibly leading to poor performance or not even obtaining results. To alleviate these problems we define an architecture for systems that deal with these problems by allowing for a transparent and integrated way to query the multiple sources. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we describe a study of current biological <b>databanks.</b> Then, we propose a base query language that contains operators that should be present in any query language for biological <b>databanks.</b> Further, we present an architecture for a system supporting such a language and providing integrated access to the highly distributed and heterogeneous environment of biological <b>databanks...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Homogenization is {{necessary}} for all climate data to correct for non-climatic changes, such as introduction of different measurement instruments, changes in location of the instruments, or differences {{in the time of}} day that measurements are taken. The NOAA temperature dataset is regularly updated with refinements improving the allowance for known biases, including the effects of past changes in methods of collecting temperatures. In 2015 it changed from the Global Historical Climatology Network to the new International Surface Temperature Initiative <b>databank</b> which includes many more stations giving wider coverage of land surface temperatures, and the latest Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature dataset (version 4) which made improved allowances for biases, including the phased changeover from measuring ship water intake to using automatic buoys: the previous version made a simpler allowance for this. An article published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science journal in June 2015 by a team led by Thomas R. Karl, director of the NOAA datacenter, reported that these adjustments made very little difference to the temperature record, but the small change in recent years was sufficient to indicate that there had been no hiatus in the period from 1998 to 2014. They used the IPCC definition of the supposed hiatus as a slowdown in rate of temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, compared to the rate from 1951 to 2012, and again found no support for the idea of a [...] "hiatus" [...] or slowdown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Web Services and Workflow Management Systems {{can support}} {{creation}} and deployment of network systems, able to automate data analysis and retrieval processes in biomedical research. Web Services {{have been implemented}} at bioinformatics centres and workflow systems have been proposed for biological data analysis. New <b>databanks</b> are often developed by taking into account these technologies, but many existing databases do not allow a programmatic access. Only a fraction of available <b>databanks</b> can thus be queried through programmatic interfaces. SRS is a well know indexing and search engine for biomedical <b>databanks</b> offering public access to many <b>databanks</b> and analysis tools. Unfortunately, these data are not easily and efficiently accessible through Web Services. Results We have developed ‘SRS by WS’ (SWS), a tool that makes information available in SRS sites accessible through Web Services. Information on known sites is maintained in a database, srsdb. SWS consists in a suite of WS that can query both srsdb, for information on sites and databases, and SRS sites. SWS returns results in a text-only format and can be accessed through a WSDL compliant client. SWS enables interoperability between workflow systems and SRS implementations, by also managing access to alternative sites, in order to cope with network and maintenance problems, and selecting the most up-to-date among available systems. Conclusions Development and implementation of Web Services, allowing to make a programmatic access to an exhaustive set of biomedical databases can significantly improve automation of in-silico analysis. SWS supports this activity by making biological <b>databanks</b> that are managed in public SRS sites available through a programmatic interface. </p...|$|R
