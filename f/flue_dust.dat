5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in <b>flue</b> <b>dust.</b> Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E

30|$|An {{environmental}} friendly method {{was introduced to}} utilize the FCC <b>flue</b> gas <b>dust</b> in this study. A new matrix was first prepared with exhausted FCC <b>flue</b> gas <b>dust.</b> Then FCC catalysts were prepared by partial substitution of pseudo-boehmite binder by this new matrix. Compared with conventional catalyst, the FCC catalysts with new matrix have better heavy oil conversion and coke selectivity, and increased light oil yield and total liquid yield. Therefore, the utilization of <b>flue</b> gas <b>dust</b> in this new strategy has a good application prospect and remarkable economic benefits.|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} {{primary copper}} industry generates {{in excess of}} 600 million t of mining and mineral-processing waste annually.

Among the wastes generated by various copper producers are <b>flue</b> <b>dusts,</b> slags, refinery-bleed solutions, and. acid-plant wastes. The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has researched methods to mitigate the environmental threat posed by copper-processing wastes while recovering valuable metals from these materials. Acid-leach processing of <b>flue</b> <b>dusts</b> has been demonstrated feasible along with sulfide treatment of liquid refinery wastes and acid-plant-bleed and gas-cleaning solutions to precipitate dissolved metals.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the salient {{features of a}} new process for the recovery of metal values from secondary sources and waste materials such as slag and <b>flue</b> <b>dusts.</b> It is also feasible in extracting metals such as nickel and cobalt from ores that normally are difficult to enrich and process metallurgically. The salt extraction process is based on extraction of the metals from the raw materials by a molten salt bath consisting of NaCl, LiCl, and KCl corresponding to the eutectic composition with AlCl 3 as the chlorinating agent. The process is operated in the temperature range 973 K (700 °C) to 1173 K (900 °C). The process was shown {{to be successful in}} extracting Cr and Fe from electric arc furnace (EAF) slag. Electrolytic copper could be produced from copper concentrate based on chalcopyrite in a single step. Conducting the process in oxygen-free atmosphere, sulfur could be captured in the elemental form. The method proved to be successful in extracting lead from spent cathode ray tubes. In order to prevent the loss of AlCl 3 in the vapor form and also chlorine gas emission at the cathode during the electrolysis, liquid aluminum was used. The process was shown to be successful in extracting Nd and Dy from magnetic scrap. The method is a highly promising process route for the recovery of strategic metals. It also has the added advantage of being environmentally friendly...|$|R

50|$|The {{small town}} in {{question}} was Quincy, Washington. Fateful Harvest won book {{of the year honors}} from the press group Investigative Reports and Editors and for which Wilson was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. It details Wilson's investigation into the recycling of fly ash, tire ash, <b>flue</b> <b>dust,</b> tailings, phosphoric acid from car factories, baghouse dust from recycling plants, zinc skimmings from galvanizing industries, and assorted other industrial byproducts with heavy metals such as arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, lead, titanium and other chemicals into plant fertilizer based on the agronomic benefits of their alkalinity (sold as lime) or their micronutrients zinc and manganese. Part of the reasoning behind this is that plants growing in alkaline soils do not uptake the metals as easily. The problem was brought to Wilson's attention in 1996 by a woman named Patty Martin, the mayor of a small rural town named Quincy, Washington, and together Wilson and a small group of farmers conducted the investigation. The issue of heavy metals in fertilizer is sometimes mistakenly confused with biosolids, although there may be some crossover.|$|E
50|$|Wilson {{reports that}} the Bay Zinc Company, founded by Dick Camp Sr., is {{a pioneer in the}} {{recycling}} of industrial byproducts into fertilizer. Dick Camp Jr. recounts that his dad may have been the first to use <b>flue</b> <b>dust</b> from steel smokestacks, which is higher in heavy metals than the previously used zinc skimmings. Wilson finds that in 1988 Camp had been instrumental in creating the loopholes in the which allowed heavy metals in fertilizers to go unregulated. Wilson discovers that between 1990 and 1996 Bay Zinc took in roughly one and a half million pounds of lead, eighty-six thousand pounds of chromium, and nineteen thousand pounds of nickel. However, Wilson notes that Bay Zinc is relatively small in comparison to Alabama-based Frit Industries, the leader, which connected one its major factories to Nucor Steel. Together eight companies process 120 million pounds of industrial byproducts into fertilizer, roughly half of the total zinc fertilizer sold in the country (157). Wilson says this trade is facilitated by state industrial material exchanges (IMEX) and that twenty-six states have them. Later Wilson goes to see what he calls Monsanto Mountain -- Monsanto had decided in 1994 that it no longer wanted the liability of using its industrial byproducts as fertilizer.|$|E
30|$|FCC {{process is}} one of the most {{important}} technologies to convert heavy oil into liquified petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, and diesel. FCC catalyst with particle sizes in the range of 80 – 180  μm cycles between FCC riser and regenerator for hydrocarbons cracking and reactivation [3]. However, due to the collision, hydrothermal collapse, and mechanical friction in recycle, spent FCC catalyst becomes dust and escapes with the FCC flue gas when its particulate size is less than 30  μm (more than 50  % is < 10  μm), leading to higher concentration of atmospheric particulate matter pollution.

30|$|The {{simulated}} {{dust concentration}} at the boiler outlet was 4.5 g/Nm 3 at 12 % CO 2. This is {{in agreement with}} the results reported in the literature. For wood-fired boilers, Buonicore and Davis [18] reported a value of 3, 000 mg/Nm 3, whilst De Kock and Yap [19] reported that the boiler <b>flue</b> gas <b>dust</b> loads varied from 1490 to 4300 mg/Nm 3. These results were not corrected for carbon dioxide; hence, the dust load could have been higher after 12 % CO 2 correction. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 3 that even a small difference in dust collection efficiency can make a significant difference in dust concentration. For example, at 95 % efficiency, the dust concentration is 0.225 g/Nm 3, whereas at 90 % efficiency, which is lower, the dust concentration is 0.450 g/Nm 3. The latter result will not comply with the Clean Air Regulation of 1978 at 0.4 g/Nm 3.|$|R
