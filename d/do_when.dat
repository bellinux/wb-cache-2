5|$|The centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes {{greater than}} Jupiter's (5.5AU) {{and less than}} Neptune's (30AU). The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a {{diameter}} of about 250km.

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Upon Ivan's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his simple-minded son Feodor. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in {{maintaining}} exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom {{open to all}} foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by the new Tsar's late father. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent Boris Godunov that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor {{with two of his}} titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Although Allosaurus {{may have}} hunted in packs, {{it has been}} argued that Allosaurus and other theropods had largely {{aggressive}} interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they <b>do</b> <b>when</b> aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple Allosaurus individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that Allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in Allosaurus, including Allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.|$|E

5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can <b>do</b> <b>when</b> {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
