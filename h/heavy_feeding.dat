25|$|In the United States, western Europe, and Japan, {{butadiene}} {{is produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} the steam cracking process used to produce ethylene and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over 900Â°C), aliphatic hydrocarbons give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including butadiene. The quantity of butadiene produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed. Light feeds, such as ethane, give primarily ethylene when cracked, but <b>heavier</b> <b>feeds</b> favor the formation of heavier olefins, butadiene, and aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|R

The authenticity of the second peak was proved statistically. Considerable variation was observed among amoebae of similar age. In experiments in which daughter amoebae underwent different treatments, differences in the rates of incorporation of [3 H]thymidine due to differences in the nutrition of the cells were found to be a predominant cause of variation. <b>Heavy</b> <b>feeding</b> reduced labelling; starvation increased labelling while at the same time reducing variability...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between epithelial cell production and growth rate {{was investigated in}} Hydra attenuata under different feeding regimes. The increase of epithelial cell number was compared to {{the duration of the}} epithelial cell cycle using standard methods of cell cycle analysis. The results indicate that cell cycle changes accompanying changes in feeding regime are not sufficient to explain the altered growth rate. Under <b>heavy</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes, epithelial cell production equals tissue growth rate. At low feeding level or under starvation conditions the epithelial cell cycle lengthens and growth rate of epithelial cell population is slowed. However, the cell cycle changes are insufficient to account for the reduction in tissue growth and thus there is an effective overproduction of epithelial cells amounting to 10 % per day. Evidence suggests that these excess cells are phagocytized by neighboring cells in the tissue. Thus phagocytosis is directly or indirectly involved in regulating the growth of hydra tissue. ...|$|E

This insect is an inconsequential-looking, dark little beetle about one-eighth inch long that looks much like the familiar carpet beetles to which it is closely related.

30|$|Another {{observation}} {{is that the}} best results for similar values of relative set point are obtained with the heaviest oils, i.e. the Marmul oil. This suggests a higher intensity of cracking to which a <b>heavier</b> <b>feed</b> would be more susceptibleâwe have shown above that pure pyrolysis does not reduce viscosity as much as cracking in subcritical water for the same processing time. Thus, viscosity lowering can be achieved in shorter times. Oil maturation in shales might be accelerated with subcritical water processing rather than long term heating (âretortingâ). In addition to the mean molecular weight, there will be also other compositional elements (linear and branched composition, for example) which we now consider.|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{stations}} {{are commonly used}} to sustain conservation programs of scavengers but their impact on behaviour is still debated. They increase the temporal and spatial predictability of food resources while scavengers have supposedly evolved to search for unpredictable resources. In the Grands Causses (France), a reintroduced population of Griffon vultures Gyps fulvus can find carcasses at three types of sites: 1. "light feeding stations", where farmers can drop carcasses at their farm (spatially predictable), 2. "heavy feeding stations", where carcasses from nearby farms are concentrated (spatially and temporally predictable) and 3. open grasslands, where resources are randomly distributed (unpredictable). The impact of feeding stations on vultureâs foraging behaviour was investigated using 28 GPS-tracked vultures. The average home range size was maximal in spring (1272 Â± 752 km 2) and minimal in winter (473 Â± 237 km 2) and was highly variable among individuals. Analyses of home range characteristics and feeding habitat selection via compositional analysis showed that feeding stations were always preferred compared {{to the rest of}} the habitat where vultures can find unpredictable resources. Feeding stations were particularly used when resources were scarce (summer) or when flight conditions were poor (winter), limiting long-ranging movements. However, when flight conditions were optimal, home ranges also encompassed large areas of grassland where vultures could find unpredictable resources, suggesting that vultures did not lose their natural ability to forage on unpredictable resources, even when feeding stations were available. However during seasons when food abundance and flight conditions were not limited, vultures seemed to favour light over <b>heavy</b> <b>feeding</b> stations, probably because of the reduced intraspecific competition and a pattern closer to the natural dispersion of resources in the landscape. Light feeding {{stations are}} interesting tools for managing food resources, but donât prevent vultures to feed at other places with possibly high risk of intoxication (poison) ...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{depredation}} by red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) causes serious {{economic losses}} to agricultural crops {{each year in}} both Canada and the United States. The concentration of vulnerable, monocultural crops, particularly corn, during periods when large flocks of blackbirds congregate in roosting areas prior to migration has invariably led to <b>heavy</b> <b>feeding</b> pressure (Stone et al., 1972; Wiens and Dyer, 1975; Tyler et al., 1978). Efforts to reduce damage levels by mechanical and chemical dispersal agents have been largely unsuccessful, {{at least in terms}} of a long-term solution to the problem. Recently, the lethal control of blackbird populations using surfactants has been proposed. However, the potential repercussions of the removal of substantial numbers of birds from northern breeding areas are virtually unknown (Robertson et al., 1978). Much of the research dealing with the feeding ecology of red-winged blackbirds has been limited to fall and winter periods when large aggregations of birds are actively involved in crop depredation (Goddad, 1969; Williams, 1976; Dolbeer et al., 1978) or pose a potential health hazard (Monroe and Cronholm, 1976). However, what is not known is the degree to which the removal of deleterious weed seed and insect pests cited in several studies (Bird and Smith, 1964; Mott et al., 1972; Robertson et al., 1978) might be of potential value to agriculture. The issue of whether the benefits derived from redwing foraging compensate for the negative aspects associated with crop depredation and health hazards remains largely unresolved. The present study attempted to evaluate the pest status of this species using diet information derived from food habits analysis conducted during the residency of red- winged blackbirds in a northern breeding area. By determining how the feeding ecology of red-winged blackbirds varies on a seasonal basis, among different breeding habitats and between sexes, we hoped to determine more realistically which segments of the population might be responsible for the greatest benefits or detriments and, thereby, more accurately evaluate the economic impact of the species as a whole. To achieve this aim, the study provides an accurate description of the common insects and weed pests utilized by redwings. By determining the relative proportions of those items known to be detrimental, we hoped to illustrate, at least qualitatively, the degree to which redwing foraging is comprised of both beneficial and harmful components...|$|E
3000|$|Classical {{viscosity}} {{breaking of}} vacuum distillate residue or bitumens requires temperatures well {{in excess of}} 400 Â Â°C and up to 500 Â Â°C. This involves direct heating with coils or in soak drums as the pressure has to stay low to encourage cracking. Another method used to heat <b>heavy</b> <b>feeds</b> is hot water. Low pressure steam aids thermal cracking to make the smallest chemical building blocks such as ethylene and propyleneâalthough this requires even higher temperatures. By contrast, lower temperature steam mobilises heavy hydrocarbons in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (in situ) as well as post-processing such as bituminous oil (âtar sandsâ). The viscosity is reduced as long as heat is applied enabling improved mobility. Simultaneously, the steam selectively removes (âstripsâ) lighter components from the crude, but no cracking takes place as the temperature is well below the 340 Â Â°C threshold. Once the heating conditions are removed (i.e. after the heating zone), cooling results in a viscosity increase again.|$|R

The decline in light crude oil has increased the share of heavy oils in the crude slate fed to refineries. The development of new catalysts that can withstand deactivation by <b>heavy</b> <b>feeds</b> can be readily applied in industry. The aims of this work centred in the development and characterisation of novel NiMo mesoporous catalysts along the testing of such materials in hydrocracking reactions using a <b>heavy</b> hydrocarbon <b>feed,</b> Maya vacuum residue (VR). Four categories of catalytic supports were synthesised: mesoporous alumina (Al 2 O 3), mesoporous alumina doped with Cr (Al 2 O 3 -Cr), mesoporous silica alumina (MSA) and carbon nanofibres (CNF). An experimental method was developed for one hour hydrocracking reactions between 400 and 450 Â°C in a batch reactor using VR. Selected catalysts were utilised in a second reaction with fresh feed. The catalysts short term deactivation was investigated and related to the product distribution and reaction conditions. It was found that reaction temperature had an important impact on conversions and product distributions. The conversion of materials with a boiling point above 450 Â°C was mainly thermally driven. NiMo catalysts supported on Al 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 -Cr and CNF led to high asphaltene conversions without suffering significant deactivation. On the other hand, the MSA supported catalyst was active mainly due to thermal reactions and its pores were blocked by coke deposits by the first hour of reaction. The Al 2 O 3 -Cr support allowed not only higher NiMo dispersion than Al 2 O 3, but also better dispersion of the coke deposits after reaction. NiMo catalysts supported on CNF showed they could be very active in VR hydroprocessing, depending on their synthesis conditions. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The steam {{cracking}} process {{is an important}} asset in the hydrocarbon processing industry. The main products are lower olefins and hydrogen, with ethylene being the world's largest volume organic chemical at a worldwide capacity of ~ 120 million tonnes per year. Feed stocks are hydrocarbons such as: ethane, LPG, naphtha's, gas condensates and gas oil. The research goal of this thesis is {{to search for the}} intrinsic optimal {{steam cracking}} reaction conditions, pushing the olefin yields to the maximum that the fundamental reaction kinetic models allow for. To get to that goal we have: firstly, identified and assessed alternative process concepts published in the literature. Secondly, developed the concepts and software for an equation based modelling tool suitable for optimisation of large scale reaction kinetic models. Thirdly, developed a new reactor concept, d-RMix for homogeneous reactions with distributed feed allocation, product removal and macro-mixing. Fourthly, applied the optimisation tool to the new reactor concept model and an advanced reaction kinetic model for steam cracking, SPYRO(r). For four different feed stocks optimisations of ethylene yield and of ethylene plus propylene yields have been carried out. For the cracking of ethane a linear-concave unconstrained temperature profile with a (free) maximum temperature of ~ 1260 K proves optimal. For propane and <b>heavier</b> <b>feed</b> stocks an isothermal profile at the upper temperature bound is optimal, with dips at the beginning and the middle of the reaction volume coordinate. For these <b>heavier</b> hydrocarbon <b>feeds</b> a distribution along the reactor volume coordinate does result in higher yields.

By 1983, 8. 2 percent of the seedlings examined in seedbeds were injured by this moth. A spray program was adoptel in 1984 {{to reduce the amount}} of damage. Three applications of Diazinon at 1 lb. active ingredient per acre were used to kill adult moths, and three applications of Dursban at the same rate were used to reduce larval populations in the soil of Douglas-fir beds.

There were no beds of unsprayed Douglas-fir seedlings to use as a check.

30|$|Autoxidation is a {{conversion}} pathway {{that has the}} potential to add value to multinuclear aromatic-rich coal liquids, heavy oils and bitumens, which are typically considered low-value liquids. In particular, autoxidation of these heavy materials could lead to products that may have petrochemical values, e.g., lubricity improvers and emulsifiers. Proper assessment of an oxidative transformation to ring-open the multinuclear aromatics present in <b>heavy</b> <b>feeds</b> relies on the understanding of the fundamentals of aromatic oxidation. This work reviews the selective oxidation chemistry of atoms that form part of an aromatic ring structure using oxygen (O 2) as oxidant, i.e., the oxidation of aromatic carbons as well as heteroatoms contained in an aromatic ring. Examples of industrially relevant oxidations of aromatic and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are provided. The requirements to produce oxygenates involving the selective cleavage of the ring CâC bonds, as well as competing non-selective oxidation reactions are discussed. On the other hand, the Clar formalism, i.e., a rule that describes the stability of polycyclic systems, assists the interpretation of the reactivity of multinuclear aromatics towards oxidation. Two aspects are developed. First, since the interaction of oxygen with aromatic hydrocarbons depends on their structure, oxidation chemistries which are fundamentally different are possible, namely, transannular oxygen addition, oxygen addition to a carbonâcarbon double bond, or free radical chemistry. Second, hydrogen abstraction is not necessary for the initiation of the oxidation of aromatics compared to that of aliphatics.|$|R
