Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Bitola inscription where the victory of Samuil, commander of the Bulgarian army, is mentioned <b>in</b> <b>summary</b> form, several medieval historians have written accounts for the battle. Among them were Leo the Deacon who was an eyewitness and a direct participant in the campaign; John Skylitzes and two other historians George Kedrin and Joannes Zonaras who repeat the work of Skylitzes. Not only Byzantine historians wrote accounts for the battle, it was also recorded by the Melkite chronicler Yahaya of Antioch and the Armenians, Stephen of Taron (also known as Asolic) and Matthew of Edessa. More details {{can be found in}} the commended sermon of Saint Photius of Thessaly.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>summary,</b> Luang Pu Sodh had a {{significant}} impact on Thai Buddhism, both in Thailand and abroad. He helped pioneer the combination of study and meditation, traditionally two separate monastic vocations. Newell points out that in this he even preceded Phra Phimontham, the administrator monk who introduced the New Burmese (meditation) Method in Thailand. Luang Pu Sodh ordained a British monk that helped pioneer Buddhism in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, he started many developments that were continued by Wat Phra Dhammakaya, later to become the largest temple of Thailand.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>summary,</b> {{the desired}} line L1 {{is defined by}} two points: the radical center G of the three given circles and the pole in C1 {{of one of the}} four lines {{connecting}} the homothetic centers. Finding the same pole in C2 and C3 gives L2 and L3, respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which one pair of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line L'k does not intersect its circle C'k for some k, there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.|$|E

But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>summary,</b> the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E

40|$|The {{manuscript}} studies NGOs {{in international}} law. For that purpose, NGOs were appraised under {{each of the}} sources of international law, which, according to authoritative legal doctrine, were listed in article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The thesis also addresses the challenges to the legitimacy of States and Intergovernmental Organizations in an era in which electoral democracies constitute the predominant form of government. The research has identified that international law is changing to accommodate new subjects of law that were not conceivable under positivism. The author argues that NGOs are subjects of law to the same extent that Intergovernmental Organizations are, because both are created by subjects of international law (States and individuals) under a typical principal-agent relationship as rational-legal bodies entrusted with certain functions, which, with the attendant duties and responsibilities, were clothed by its constituencies ‘with the competence required to enable those functions to be effectively discharged’.
