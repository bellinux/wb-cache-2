40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} {{has dramatically}} enriched both the functional and structural diversity of proteins in mammals. Due to the non-template biosynthesis of glycoproteins in the nature, glycoproteins always exist as heterogeneous mixtures with different glycan structures, which have complicated {{the isolation of}} pure and well-defined glycoforms for detailed mechanistic and functional studies. Over the past years, different strategies including chemical and chemoenzymatic methods {{have been developed for}} obtaining the homogenous glycoproteins, which will offer new opportunities to conduct an extensive assessment of relationship between the structure and function of glycoproteins and to reveal the biological role of the individual oligosaccharide on a glycoprotein for the evolution and development of cells. This chapter gives insight into the recent progress in the development of chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogenous glycoproteins including native chemical ligation, serine/threonine ligation, and chemoenzymatic <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>remodeling.</b> Examples are selected to demonstrate successful applications of synthetic strategies developed so far...|$|E

Oxazolines are formed directly from the anomeric OPMP protected N-acetyl glucosamine derivatives. Efficient endohexosaminidase catalysed glycosylation of a synthetic beta-D-GlcpNAcAsn glycosyl amino acid is demonstrated with the trisaccharide oxazoline donor...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} {{is among}} the most common and well-defined post-translational modifications due to its vital role in protein function. Monitoring variation in glycosylation is necessary for producing more effective therapeutic proteins. Glycans attached to glycoproteins interact highly specific with lectins, natural carbohydrate-binding proteins, which property is used in the current label-free methodology. We have established a lectin microarray for label-free detection of lectin-carbohydrate interactions allowing us to study protein glycosylation directly on unmodified glycoproteins. The method enables simultaneous measurement of up to 96 lectin-carbohydrate interactions on a multiplex surface plasmon resonance imaging platform within 20 min. Specificity determination of lectins succeeded by analysis of neoglycoproteins and enzymatically <b>remodeled</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> to verify carbohydrate binding. We demonstrated the possibilities for glycosylation fingerprinting by comparing different Erythropoietin sources without the need for any sample pretreatment {{and we were able to}} accurately quantify relative sialylation levels of Erythropoietin...|$|R
