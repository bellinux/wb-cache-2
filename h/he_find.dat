5|$|The next morning, Logan is {{informed}} that Ichirō has died. At the funeral, Yakuza gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal {{as quickly as}} they should. After fighting off more Yakuza on a bullet train, Logan and Mariko hide in a local love hotel. Meanwhile, Ichirō's bodyguard Harada meets with Dr. Green who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands <b>he</b> <b>find</b> Logan and Mariko. Logan and Mariko travel to Ichirō's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying, and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Mariko's fiancé, corrupt Minister of Justice Noburo Mori. Mori confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have Mariko killed because Ichirō left control of the company to Mariko, and not Shingen.|$|E
5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did <b>he</b> <b>find</b> out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary does <b>he</b> <b>find</b> his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, Rodriguez-Ramon {{distinguished}} Soler's {{case from}} Scherk by two factors.

Nor did <b>he</b> <b>find</b> Southland Corp. v.

Prominent Little Rock attorney George Rose wrote a letter to outgoing Governor Thomas McRae requesting that <b>he</b> <b>find</b> a way to release the remaining defendants if they agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder.

Aoyama agrees, and with a friend, stages a phony audition to meet a potential new partner in life. After interviewing several women, Aoyama becomes interested in Asami (Eihi Shiina), who responds well to him, although as they begin to date, her dark past begins to affect their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, {{it is kind of}} hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can <b>he</b> <b>find</b> a reason to continue? Can <b>he</b> <b>find</b> the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E

[...] Inside they found Wells, an old woman named Mary Squires, her children, Virtue Hall and a woman they supposed was Wells's daughter. [...] Another woman, Judith Natus, was brought down from the loft to be questioned with the rest. [...] The warrant officer who searched the loft was surprised when he discovered {{that it did not}} resemble the room described by Canning, and nor could <b>he</b> <b>find</b> evidence of her having jumped from the window. [...] The rest of the party, who had by then arrived in a hired coach and chaise, were similarly surprised.|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will <b>he</b> <b>find</b> this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Introduced in the 2008 {{video game}} Street Fighter IV, Rufus is angered that martial artist Ken Masters is {{declared}} the best fighter in America. Per Candy's suggestion that <b>he</b> <b>find</b> and defeat Ken {{to prove himself}} as the best, he declares Ken as his rival and sets out to find him. However, {{along the way he}} repeatedly mistakes other fighters for Ken, attacking similarly dressed or blonde people regardless of gender, and blames the mistaken identities on his belief Ken is using decoys to delay him, notably, the character Abel. He eventually confronts Ken, who states he does not know who Rufus is, which angers him further before they fight. In the game's conclusion, Rufus is shown pushing his broken down motorcycle uphill with Candy on board, using it as training and blaming Ken for the predicament. At the conclusion of Super Street Fighter IV, Rufus repairs his motorcycle and at Candy's request for a colder climate, heads due north to the North Pole.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, the local-born Chinese, who {{retained}} {{significant economic}} power, began {{pushing for a}} greater role in Malayan government. Much of the Chinese community, which now made up 45% of the Malayan population, still comprised transient labourers. Nevertheless, the Straits Chinese — which comprised the bulk of local-born Chinese — wanted to be given government positions and recognised as Malayans. One Straits Chinese leader asked, [...] "Who said this is a Malay country? ... When Captain [...] Light arrived, did <b>he</b> <b>find</b> Malays, or Malay villages? Our forefathers came here and worked hard as coolies — weren't ashamed to become coolies — and they didn't send their money back to China. They married and spent their money here, and in this way the Government was able to open up the country from jungle to civilization. We've become inseparable from this country. It's ours, our country..." [...] Malay intellectuals objected to this reasoning, claiming that such reasoning is totally absurd and proposing an analogy with the Chinese as masons and Malaya as a house. A paid mason, they argued, was not entitled to a share in the ownership rights to a home he built. As such, they opposed any attempt to grant the Chinese citizenship or other political rights.|$|E
500|$|With September nearly dead, Peter {{decides to}} use Walter's {{equipment}} {{to enter the}} Observer's mind to try to learn of Olivia's location. Within September's consciousness, Peter learns the Observers are {{a team of scientists}} from one possible future of humanity, having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation. September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes. Ultimately, this would lead to the birth of Henry, Peter's child with the parallel universe's Olivia, which September claimed never should have happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events. By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline, Henry also ceased to exist. September explains that Peter's reappearance may be a means to set things right, and insists <b>he</b> <b>find</b> a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia. As the reality of September's mind breaks down and he claims [...] "they are coming", the Observer tells Peter to [...] "go home".

500|$|Before {{the first}} of the song's two {{instrumental}} breaks, Harrison states that this world is [...] "Such a long way from home" [...] – home being [...] "spiritual understanding", according to Inglis. This repeated line is viewed as significant by Tillery and by Christian theologian Dale Allison, on the basis of whether Harrison intended the final word to be [...] "home" [...] or the sacred Sanskrit term [...] "Om". Tillery writes: [...] "Where does <b>he</b> <b>find</b> himself? 'Such a long way from home' ... but in his autobiography, he renders it, 'Such a long way from OM' – confessing his inner turmoil at having strayed from his faith." [...] Allison identifies Extra Texture as being unique among Harrison's post-Beatles solo albums due to its complete avoidance of [...] "positive theological statements", mirroring the [...] "emptiness" [...] of Harrison's apparently faithless existence in 1975, and he interprets this particular lyric as the singer [...] "expressing his remoteness from both God and his ideals". While noting that the ancient Hindu text Bhagavad Gita [...] "identifies the sound 'OM' with Brahman and promises that chanting it with attention on one's deathbed will lead one to 'the highest goal'", Allison writes of its possible inclusion in the context of [...] "World of Stone": [...] "All pontifical pronouncements have ceased. George has come to doubt what matters to him most." ...|$|E

His father killed his mother {{when it was}} discovered that Haku possesses a genetic ability, , that allows him to mix wind and water elements to create ice, which was considered a threat and Haku then killed his father. After wandering from place to place for a time he was found by Zabuza. Zabuza recognized Haku's talents and agreed to take him in as a tool. As a result, Haku becomes unquestioningly protective of and loyal to Zabuza, and only by being useful does <b>he</b> <b>find</b> a purpose in life. Haku later meets Naruto (who mistakes him for a girl) while he is training, and the two bond over their connections. On this same mission, Haku ultimately gives his life in his mission to save his master from Kakashi's Lightning Blade, becoming the first casualty in the series. This is not in vain, however, as a saddened Naruto uses Haku's death to redeem Zabuza. [...] Episode 17 of the anime greatly expands on Haku's early life, visually showing the scene where Haku discovered his powers. [...] Haku is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi later in Part 2 of the series to fight in the Fourth Shinobi World War until being sealed by the Allied Shinobi Forces. His voice actress in the Japanese anime is Mayumi Asano, and his English voice actress is Susan Dalian. Mona Marshall voiced Haku as a child.|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now all you want is a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote [...] "Strange how I suggested <b>he</b> <b>find</b> himself a canine companion at ...|$|E
500|$|Lajoie's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Naps' play worsened. [...] "You can't win {{in the major leagues}} unless you have players who know the game. We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, <b>he</b> <b>find</b> the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E
