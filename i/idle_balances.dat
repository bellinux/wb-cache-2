This paper investigated {{the impact of the}} 2007 / 2008 global financial crisis on the Nigerian capital market. Monthly time series data from January 2006 to December 2009. All Share Index (ASI) was used as proxy for the performance of the Nigerian Capital market, while Credit to the Private Sector (CPS), Price of Crude Oil (POIL), Money Supply (MS) and Dow Jonews Industrial Average (DJIA) were the set of explanatory variables used to ascertain the effects of the crisis on the capital market in Nigeria. The paper employed the Vector Error Correction (VEC) model for the analysis. Based on the estimated Cointegration and the VEC analyses, the paper found that the global finanancial crisis adverstly and significantly affected the Nigerian capital market both in the shortrun and long run. This was clearly evidenced by the fact that POIL slumped to a record low level, MS equally decreased and the CPS contracted thereby reducing the <b>idle</b> <b>balances</b> which could have been invested in stocks. All these are clear evidences of the crisis on the performance of the Nigerian capital market. Hence the global financial crisis of 2007 / 2008 was no respecter of any economy, eventhough some writers in Nigeria were quick in concluding that the Nigerian financial sector was insulated and robust, but it was not long after the economy was brought to its knees as the stock market in Nigeria crashed leading to a valuable lost of capital assets and investments...|$|E

In general, we do not find any support for the liquidity trap hypothesis. Moreover, we cannot conclude that the response of the demand for money to changes in interest rates was significantly different than in the past. However, we do find that through history the magnitude of the response of money demand to changes in interest rates has been relatively smaller in Japan, suggesting that traditional money demand relationships may not hold.

40|$|The {{last two}} years have brought a {{profound}} {{change in the way}} that monetary policy is implemented. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve defined its near-term objective in terms of the fed funds rate. The Fed sought to achieve this target by using purchases or sales of Treasury securities to control excess reserves and the money supply. Beginning in August 2007, the Fed came to see its objective instead in terms of maintaining market “liquidity, ” which in practice might be measured by the spread between the fed funds rate and other interest rates to which the overnight rate had historically been closely linked. Initially these new operations took the form of expanded use of repos, through which the Fed could effectively take the place of private repo lenders, offering short-term loans at terms more favorable than private lenders were offering. In December 2007, the Fed introduced a new Term Auction Facility for lending to banks and expanded currency swaps with other central banks. To prevent these measures from affecting the money supply and overnight rate, the Fed sterilized these operations by selling offsetting volumes of its Treasury holdings. In the fall of 2008, the Fed embarked on a huge expansion of these and other programs, simultaneously adopting measures to ensure that the newly created funds were held as excess reserves or <b>idled</b> Treasury <b>balances</b> so as 2 again to prevent any effect on the money supply. For purposes of this discussion, I will group together all of the Fed’s assets other than Treasuries into a single composite, and describe the sum as a measure of “targeted liquidity operations. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a marked upsurge in the output of {{literature}} dealing with the demand for money, but {{with the exception of the}} North American Continent, empirical research has lagged distressingly far behind the voluminous output of theory. This dearth of empirical results has had a restrictive influence. Since any of the controversial points which are being disputed by theoreticians can only be resolved by recourse to empirical methods. The restriction of empirical research to the North American Continent has further meant that the various points under dispute have had only a limited qualification and consequently monetary theorists have had no indication as to the universalizability of their conclusions. There is thus a great need for empirical studies in other countries so that the validity of the rival theories can be tested under different conditions. It was with these thoughts in mind that the present study was undertaken. Its objectives are strictly national and no pretense of strict international comparability is made. Further, great care has been taken to avoid the pitfall so beloved of econometricians, the fallacy of reduction wherein strictly limited results are uncritically universalized. Thus no attempt has been made to draw conclusions which will have universal validity. The theoretically vital points which are going to be examined in the light of South African experience are: 1. The feasibility of distinguishing <b>idle</b> from active <b>balances,</b> and if this proves possible, the determination of the wealth and interest elasticities of these balances; 2. Dropping the explicit distinction between <b>idle</b> and active <b>balances</b> to (a) determine the role of interest rates, (b) determine the appropriate constraint on the demand function, (c) determine what effect different definitions of money have on (a) and (b); 3. To examine the stability of the demand function over time. Truth is, of course, many-sided and any uniform presentation can only aspire to present a one-sided picture, just like a photograph cannot hope to do justice to the full grandeur of nature, merely presenting a one-dimensional representation of a many dimensioned object. In spite of this restriction which is inherent in all econometrical studies, this one-sided picture seems to be justified in view of the lack of any unified and coherent treatment of the demand for money in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Clusters of {{computers}} {{have emerged as}} mainstream parallel and distributed platforms for high performance, high throughput, and high availability computing. To enable effective load balancing in distributed systems, numerous schedulers have been designed. Migration of the job from an overloaded node to the idle node, involves matching the possessions of the idle computer with the job requirements. Both code and data are {{to be transferred to}} the idle node from overloaded node. The job is executed at the idle node. The results are transferred back to the host node. These consume a lot of bandwidth, processor time, and memory. A good selection of job results in less execution time, efficient usage of resources and overall increase in the throughput of the system with the minimum cost. The selection of the job and its subsequent execution is an interesting area of research. The proposed criteria based method assigns a weight for each criterion of each job of several predefined criteria. Then the total weights of all the jobs are found out. The job with the highest weight will be considered for submission. Key words Distributed system, load <b>balance,</b> <b>Idle,</b> overloaded, criteria, weight...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The IEEE 802. 11 MAC {{protocol}} provides {{shared access}} to a wireless channel. This paper uses an analytic model to study the channel capacity – i. e., maximum throughput – when using the basic access (two-way handshaking) method in this protocol. It provides closed-form approximations for the probability of collision p, the maximum throughput S and the limit {{on the number of}} stations in a wireless cell. The analysis also shows that: p does not depend on the packet length, the latency in crossing the MAC and physical layers, the acknowledgment timeout, the interframe spaces and the slot size; p and S (and other performance measures) depend on the minimum window size W and the number of stations n only through a gap g D W=. n 1 / – consequently, halving W is like doubling n; the maximum contention window size has minimal effect on p and S; the choice of W that maximizes S is proportional to the square root of the packet length; S is maximum when transmission rate (including collisions) equals the reciprocal of transmission time, and this happens when channel wastage due to collisions <b>balances</b> <b>idle</b> bandwidth caused by backoffs. The results suggest guidelines on when and how W can be adjusted to suit measured traffic, thus making the protocol adaptive...|$|R
6000|$|In San Bartolomeo, as {{in other}} squares, the {{buildings}} are palaces above and shops below. The ground-floor {{is devoted to the}} small commerce of various kinds already mentioned; the first story above is occupied by tradesmen's families; and on the third or fourth floor is the appartamento signorile. From the balconies of these stories hung the cages of innumerable finches, canaries, blackbirds, and savage parrots, which sang and screamed with delight in the noise that rose from the crowd. All the human life, therefore, which the spring drew to the casements was perceptible only in dumb show. One of the palaces opposite was used as a hotel, and faces continually appeared at the windows. By all odds the most interesting figure there was that of a stout peasant serving-girl, dressed in a white knitted jacket, a crimson neckerchief, and a bright-colored gown, and wearing long dangling ear-rings of yellowest gold. For hours this <b>idle</b> maiden <b>balanced</b> herself half over the balcony-rail in perusal of the people under her, and I suspect made love at that distance, and in that constrained position, to some one in the crowd. On another balcony, a lady sat and knitted with crimson yarn; and at the window of still another house, a damsel now looked out upon the square, and now gave a glance into the room, in the evident direction of a mirror. Venetian neighbors have the amiable custom of studying one another's features through opera-glasses; but I could not persuade myself to use this means of learning the mirror's response to the damsel's constant [...] "Fair or not?"

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{assembly line}} balancing problem considers {{the manufacturing process}} of a product where production is specified {{in terms of a}} sequence of tasks that need to be assigned to workstations. Each task takes a known number of time units to complete. Also, precedence constraints exist among tasks: each task can be assigned to a station only after all its predecessors have been assigned to stations. The U-shaped assembly line balancing problem is a relatively new problem derived from the traditional assembly line balancing problem. In the U-shaped assembly line balancing problem tasks can be assigned to stations either after all its predecessors or all of its successors have been assigned to stations. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) solution to the Type I U-shaped assembly line balancing problem.
