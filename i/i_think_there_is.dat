25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a growing}} distaste {{for the family}} duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E

It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There {{are people out there who}} think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E

500|$|Calvert {{dispatched}} Captain Edward Wynne and a {{group of}} Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, [...] "It is better and not so cold as England," [...] and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: [...] "The land on which our Governor [...] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no better in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was [...] "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{think the}} {{decision}} {{will have no}} impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information.

In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no possibility of any defensible [...] "right" [...] to censor what other people are saying.

Moore took {{a keen interest in}} Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending Cornell Medical School, where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to New York City following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer Mary McCarthy stated, [...] "Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop." [...] Moore helped Bishop first publish some of her poems in an anthology called Trial Balances in which established poets introduced the work of unknown, younger poets.|$|E

Our peasants, however, want to make the goods of other men common, and keep their own for themselves.

2500|$|At the {{direction}} of top officials of the Spitzer administration, the New York State Police created documents meant to cause political damage to Bruno. [...] The governor's staff had stated they were responding to a Freedom of Information request from the Albany Times-Union in late June.

[...] Dopp later wrote another e-mail to Baum after a story ran in the Albany Times-Union about {{a federal grand jury}} investigation of Bruno's investments in thoroughbred racing horses, and wrote: [...] "Think travel story would fit nicely in the mix." [...] The first Freedom of Information Act request about Bruno's travel was filed by the Times Union on June 27, nearly a month after.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. I {{think of it as a}} musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sullivan ... {{was very}} much in touch with all the music of his time.... There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time – you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is,</b> also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria is a very interesting piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue there. You can tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra. [...] He had always been cramped by the small orchestra, only ever one oboe, that he had to make do with at the Savoy. [...] Here he was really able to expand, you can feel it in the music." ...|$|E
