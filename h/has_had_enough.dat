5|$|Heather <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fueled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, {{she takes}} the baby and walks out ("Too Much, Too Soon"). Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E

Sameer says that he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> dreaming, and wishes Sunny happiness. Sunny taunts Sameer again, and Sameer loses his temper. He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents. He asks {{her to marry him}} in front of the crowd, and Rani runs onto the field and embraces him, thus reuniting with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{blind man}} pesters {{the other for}} details. He wants to know: “Is it still day? Will it not soon be night? Is there grass anywhere?” He insists on {{listening}} for sounds which the other can’t hear. Eventually the wheelchair-using man <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and he starts to threaten the fiddler who {{at the very end}} wrenches the man’s pole from out of his hands at which point the action freezes in a final tableau.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the performance, a Patbot {{performs}} {{instead of}} Pat, unbeknown to the audience. Wilf, knowing {{it to be}} a robot (and not realising there is the real Pat too), tries to unmask the Patbot. Then, the real Pat interrupts the performance. As Carbunkle releases the first few Patbots to kill off Pat, Simon Cowbell and Mr Brown, revealing that he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of them hindering his plans, Josh saves them. Little does Pat know that his wife and friends from Greendale arrive in the chaos.|$|E
25|$|Living {{conditions}} degenerate further when a clique of ward-3 men, {{armed with}} one handgun held by an ex-barman who declares himself {{the king of}} ward, gains control over the food deliveries. The MRE rations are distributed only {{in exchange for the}} other wards' valuables, and then for sex with the women of the other wards. When one of the women is beaten to death by the man having the coerced sex with her, the doctor's wife <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and soon kills the king with scissors to the neck. His death initiates a chaotic war confrontation between the wards, which culminates with ward-3 and then most of the building being burned down and some inmates dying in the fire. The survivors discover that the guards have abandoned their posts and they are free to venture into the city.|$|E
25|$|Semar {{decides that}} he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> humiliation; {{although}} he is very powerful, he feels constantly abused by humans and gods. With his favourite son Bagong {{he goes to the}} palace of the gods in Kayangan. However, only Semar is admitted; Bagong is chased off by two guards. Semar speaks to the gods Batara Guru and Batara Narada and asks to regain the handsome face he had once had. This they give him, using plastic surgery. Semar is made human and given his own kingdom, Simpang Bawana Nuranitis Asri. Semar changes his name to Prabu Sanggadonya Lukanurani. Although he has become leader of his own kingdom, Semar is unable to find happiness. His wife, not believing that he is Semar, leaves him; only his sons Petruk and Gareng join him. They begin building the kingdom, but are displeased to find that all of its riches are not enough to ensure harmony.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} study that Dr. Kupferberg introduces to Dr. Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study {{when he and}} some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked forensic psychologist Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Dugan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after he read it and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring of questions and concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides it <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of it.|$|E
500|$|The chorus {{continues}} and {{the video}} cuts to {{a scene in}} which Rihanna and other people dance at an outside rave; Calvin Harris features as the DJ. As the second chorus begins, Rihanna and her boyfriend are happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing each other in a shopping cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. However, they begin arguing in a car. The video then shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. They eventually begin to physically abuse one another. During the final chorus, Rihanna is seen vomiting streamers; she is also seen unconscious on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. After [...] finding the boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, Rihanna decides she <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of the relationship and leaves him. The video ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] {{continues}} {{the theme of}} road weariness from the album's previous song, [...] "Highway 61 Revisited." [...] The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as [...] "Saint Annie" [...] and [...] "sweet Melinda", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and finds the means to leave it all behind and head back to New York City, where things may be better. Author Paul Williams has noted that scene and situation are combined into a gorgeous evocation of muddied consciousness in [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", without ever resolving into {{a clear picture of}} what the song is about. Despite the sordid details of the singer's experiences in Juarez, the lyrics maintain a sense of humor, and William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website considers the song a comic tour de force.|$|E

500|$|Randy {{tries to}} keep other {{countries}} from spending the space cash since that might alert the Intergalactic Police; however, this fails when Mexico spends its money on 32 hospitals and 7 water parks, and China spends it on 48 soccer stadiums. Learning that Finland is about to divulge to the cops, Randy persuades {{the rest of the}} world to wipe Finland out in a nuclear missile attack. The Intergalactic Police pay a third visit to ask about the strike, but the South Park residents fake disbelief. By this time, Stan <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of the deception, so he tells the truth about cheating in the pinewood derby and returns his trophy; however, no one else on the planet comes clean about the space cash. McGeezax emerges from the officers' ship, having only faked his death. He reveals that he is really Kevern Zaksor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community but humans proven to be too selfish, greedy, chaotic and deceitful. As punishment for failing, the Earth and the Moon are isolated from the rest of the Universe (although it appears to have disappeared later on). The episode ends with Randy saying, [...] "Well that sucks." ...|$|E
500|$|The eponymous story {{revolves}} around Yertle the Turtle, {{the king of}} the pond. Dissatisfied with the stone that serves as his throne, he commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see farther and expand his kingdom. However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him to be quiet. Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain to the turtles {{at the bottom of the}} pile, as well as hunger. Again, Yertle yells at Mack to be quiet. Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something [...] "dares to be higher than Yertle the King", he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before he can give the command, Mack decides he <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough.</b> He burps, which takes away Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him [...] "King of the Mud" [...] and freeing the others.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley), {{supported}} by her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), auditions {{for the role}} of Maria and impresses the directors—Emma, Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Artie (Kevin McHale)—with her rendition of [...] "Spotlight". They schedule a callback between her and Rachel (Lea Michele) to help them decide who should be cast in the role. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and when Will pushes her in the glee club's extra dance rehearsals that Rachel is excused from, she decides she <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and quits glee club. When Mercedes and Rachel compete by singing [...] "Out Here On My Own" [...] in the callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better, which prompts Rachel to begin a last-minute candidacy for senior class president to improve her college prospects; this dismays Kurt, who now has another rival to campaign against. The three directors decide to offer the role of Maria to both contenders, with each to do half the performances, but Mercedes is convinced she deserved to win the part outright and refuses to accept half a role. She withdraws from contention, which leaves Rachel as the sole Maria, and volunteers to join Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) new glee club. The cast list is posted, with Rachel as Maria, Blaine as Tony, Santana as Anita, Mike as Riff, and Kurt as Officer Krupke.|$|E

500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and snaps {{at her father}} for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E
