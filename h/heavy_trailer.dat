50|$|To support {{industry}} in the Tettauer Winkel on 1 June 1952 the Deutsche Bundesbahn introduced a Culemeyer <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> service. The goods wagons were transported on heavy trailers over the new road built in 1951 from Steinbach am Wald to Alexanderhütte. There they were transferred to the rails and hauled by a Köf shunter to the sidings at Tettau and Alexanderhütte. Until 1989 about 3,400 trips were carried out annually. The 'island operation' between Tettau and Alexanderhütte was closed in 1983, and the Köf shunted wagons in Alexanderhütte {{until the end of}} 1992. In 1987 a private haulier took over the <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> service which finally ended on 31 May 1996.|$|E

50|$|Configure Price Quote (CPQ) Software is a {{term used}} in B2B to {{describe}} software systems that help sellers quote complex and configurable products. An example could be a maker of heavy trucks. If the customer chooses a certain chassis, the choice of engines may be limited, because certain engines do not fit certain chassis. Given a certain choice of engine, the choice of trailer may be limited (e.g. a <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> requires a stronger engine), and so on. If the product is highly configurable, the user may face combinatorial explosion. Thus a configuration engine is employed to alleviate this problem.|$|E

50|$|The close seating {{arrangement}} at 4MH was also by design. To achieve {{the lowest possible}} car silhouette, the seats were within and not located on the wheel arches. Consequently, there was only space in center of the vehicle. Stability in the area was compared with the Saurer M6 and M8, despite the almost identical central tube frame means substantially better. Regarding off-road capability, he stood by his multi-wheeled brothers M6 and M8 in nothing.

50|$|Expeditions {{were offered}} with an {{adaptive}} pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a Nivomat adaptive hydraulic suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> is coupled, {{such as a}} travel trailer, and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed {{on the left and}} right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any listing caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition's headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.|$|E
50|$|Since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, {{several other}} {{tropical}} cyclones have impacted Palm Beach County. In August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay brought generally minor flooding, with 7 to 9 in of rain over the eastern {{portions of the}} county. Fay spawned an EF2 over Wellington, which deroofed stables and knocked over electrical poles and several trees at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic. Additionally, the Equine Veterinary lost more than 95% of its roof tiles and a <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> was tossed about 120 ft from its original location. An apartment building also suffered minor roof damage. About four years later, in August 2012, the outerbands of Hurricane Isaac dropped at least 15.86 in of rain near Lion Country Safari. The consequent flooding left neighborhoods, in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach and Wellington, stranded for up to several days. One man died after crashing into a concrete wall along Interstate 95 during the storm. Overall, damage in the county totaled approximately $71.59 million (2012 USD).|$|E

50|$|In 1942 a new 40-ton {{semi-trailer}} tank transporter was required.

This new trailer was designed by the Fruehauf Trailer Company (based in Detroit, MI). A new tractor unit was required, as this <b>heavier</b> <b>trailer</b> {{was more than the}} Diamond T could cope with.|$|R
50|$|The tornado first {{touched down}} in Washington County around 2:50 p.m. EST {{at the south}} edge of Fredericksburg, {{snapping}} trees at EF1 strength along a narrow path as it moved to the northeast. Several minutes later, the tornado intensified to high-end EF2 strength as it destroyed a metal truss tower and snapped numerous trees. The tornado intensified further as it passed {{to the north of}} Palmyra, where it crossed State Route 135 and ripped 6 in thick slabs of asphalt off the roadway and tossed them 10 to 30 yd. Smaller pieces of pavement were found up to a quarter-mile away. Just beyond this point, the tornado path began to widen and tremendous tree damage was observed. Homes in this area sustained damage ranging from EF2 to EF3 in intensity. As it neared the south side of New Pekin, the tornado widened and strengthened even more. By this time, it reached EF4 strength with winds estimated at 170 mph. The tornado clipped the southern fringes of town, and a large factory building was leveled to its foundation with large amounts of debris swept away. Anchor bolts were bent at this location, and debris from the factory was scattered up to 0.75 mi downwind. A metal building {{on the edge of the}} circulation had metal sheeting pulled off, apparently from the force of inbound winds towards the circulation. Nearby, an entire family of five was killed when their mobile home was obliterated. Several other homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in the New Pekin area as well. As it neared the Clark County border, the tornado produced high-end EF3 to EF4 strength damage to many homes and farmsteads as it traversed rural areas. One brick home at the top of a ridge was completely leveled, and a <b>heavy</b> <b>trailer</b> cab from this location was found a quarter-mile away at the remains of another destroyed brick home. Several cows missing from this vicinity were never located, and thousands of trees were mowed down along a swath up to a half-mile wide. Outbuildings and grain bins were also destroyed, and a car was thrown 100 yd from one residence as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{new type}} of rolling stock {{introduced}} after electrification was designed {{so that it could}} also run on the tramway network. It consisted of 2-axle motor cars (class N), <b>heavy</b> <b>trailers</b> (class n) and light trailers (class n1), which were combined to form trains of up to nine cars in length. These were in operation until 1964. From the mid-1950s onwards, these cars were completely rebuilt using steel frames and new electric equipment. These were referred to as class N1 (motor cars) and class n2 (trailers) and were used well into the 1980s.|$|R
