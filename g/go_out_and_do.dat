[...] Feldman {{and nine}} {{other of the}} team's top young pitchers were brought to Arlington in November for a week-long conditioning camp. [...] "It's different", Feldman said. [...] "In the past, {{it was a little}} more of 'this is what you need to do, now <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it.' Most guys would do it, but this is their way of overseeing it and making sure everybody is ready." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 December 2012, Gorham {{revealed}} that the new material would be recorded {{under the name of}} Black Star Riders, and that Downey and Wharton had chosen not to participate in the new band project. Downey had decided to take a break from touring, and Wharton would be working on his own band Dare, and a film project. In March 2013, the band toured Australia under the Thin Lizzy name, with Downey and Wharton, as the opening act on a triple bill with Mötley Crüe and Kiss. Gorham stressed that Thin Lizzy would still perform together occasionally: [...] "We'll still go out as Thin Lizzy. There are still certain big festivals that we will do. Thin Lizzy is still on the horizon, we will still <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> that but in the meantime we have Black Star Riders {{that we are going to}} concentrate on also." ...|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president, Robert E. Lee, would frequently tell his students, [...] "the eyes of the South are upon you." [...] Prather was known for including in his speeches a similar admonition, [...] "The Eyes of Texas are Upon You," [...] meaning that the state of Texas was watching and expecting the students to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> great things. Prather enjoyed the song and promoted its usage. He died not long thereafter, and the song was played at his funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{currently}} teaches and directs. Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E

He just <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> the job each week." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I would {{describe}} him {{not so much}} as an artist but as a craftsman who worked hard to do a good job," [...] said his son, Joel. [...] "He really liked the newspaper business and all the glamor of it. He was a very, very hard worker. He had little formal training but <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> things. His education was more in the form of apprenticing himself to excellent cartoonists." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> some shopping. The sun was shining, {{and a soft}} west wind blowing. London, {{which seems}} to hold its populace longer than any other great city, was gay, almost joyous. He had to elbow his way through crowds as he passed along Piccadilly. The streets and shops were thronged. The sky above was blue. The rare {{sunshine}} seemed to make cheerful even this most sombre of cities.|$|R
2500|$|Rekha, their {{daughter}} was born following the completion of Wadkar's film Mera Gaon (1942). Over time when her husband physically abused her over some imagined wrong-doing, she would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it. She started drinking and describes one drinking session in her autobiography where she was unconscious of what took place. She found herself in a village where Joshi, {{one of the men}} she had been drinking with brought her as his third wife. She stayed virtually imprisoned there for three years, till she was able to smuggle a letter out to her husband. He arrived with the police, and took her to the magistrate's office in the neighbouring town, [...] [...] [...] [...] where she had to testify. The magistrate sent Bandarkar to get a signature on a paper and then proceeded to rape Wadkar. Since she did not speak out about the incident, no action was taken.|$|E
2500|$|Series co-creator Dan Povenmire {{attributed}} the genesis {{for the show}} to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama. Povenmire recalled that his mother told him [...] "never to waste a day of summer". Meanwhile, the show's other co-creator, Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh {{grew up in a}} large, blended family. Similar to Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun. The two met while working as layout artists on The Simpsons in the 1990s. Povenmire commented that [...] "We were always laughing at the same jokes". The two became a writing team on the Nickelodeon animated series Rocko's Modern Life. They began working on Phineas and Ferb around 1992, while still working together at Nickelodeon. The two had become friends due to their mutual tastes and interests. Citing their childhood, they wanted to incorporate summer vacations, a time when the two would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something constructive. They spent sixteen years pitching it to four different networks, including Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, all of which kept shooting it down due to its complexity. When Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney, despite being unsure at first, the series was accepted.|$|E

He suffered knee injuries most of his career, yet he would play a total of 195 games, more than any other Cowboys offensive player ever. He also helped to protect Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman and pave the way for Hall of Fame running back Smith to become the NFL all-time leading rusher.|$|R
50|$|After {{several months}} of combat, a warrior who hated Popoca sent a false message to the Emperor. The message said that his army had won the war, but that Popoca had died in battle. The Emperor was very sad {{when he heard the}} news, and when Izta heard she could not stop crying. She refused to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not eat any more. A few days later, she became ill and she died of sadness.|$|R

We wanted to become superheroes like Batman. It was pathetic. We were five years too old really to be doing this.

5000|$|Gabaldon was reprimanded by his {{superior}} officers, and threatened with a court-martial for leaving his post.

6000|$|... "No, George. Sometimes as evenings get {{longer we}} may make little {{excursions}} together: {{go across the}} river to Greenwich and spend {{two or three hours}} in the park, or take a steamer and go up the river to Kew; but as a general thing you had better take your rambles together.

6000|$|... "Look here, Will,"--he {{had begun}} to call me [...] "Will," [...] of late, {{probably}} because Corny called me so,--"I think it is too bad that we should just sit here and do nothing.

60|$|In the {{old days}} the Consul used, {{as a matter of}} course, to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the fighting. When there was an enemy here, or an enemy there, the Consul was bound to hurry off with his army, north or south, to {{different}} parts of Italy. But gradually this system became impracticable. Distances became too great, as the Empire extended itself beyond the bounds of Italy, to admit of the absence of the Consuls. Wars prolonged themselves through many campaigns, as notably did that which was soon to take place in Gaul under Cæsar. The Consuls remained at home, and Generals were sent out with proconsular authority. This had become so certainly the case, that Cicero on becoming Consul had no fear of being called on to fight the enemies of his country. There was much fighting then in course of being done by Pompey in the East; but this would give but little trouble to the great officers at home, unless it might be in sending out necessary supplies.|$|E
60|$|After {{all those}} {{thousands}} {{at the station}} had departed, there were still visitors enough left in Aberystwyth to distend the hotels uncomfortably; {{and the next morning}} we set out in the pursuit, always interesting and alluring, of lodgings. The town seemed to be pretty full of lodgings, but as {{it was the middle of}} August, and the very height of the season, they were full-up in dismaying measure. We found the only one not kept by a Welsh woman in the ostensible keeping of an Englishwoman, a veteran cockney landlady, but behind her tottering throne reigned a Welsh girl, under whose iron rule we fell as if we had been unworthy Saeseneg instead of Cymric-fetched Americans. We had rejected other lodgings because, though their keepers had promised to provision us, it always appeared that we must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the marketing ourselves. I shall lastingly regret that we did not submit to this condition, for it would have been one of the best means of studying the local life. But we held out for the London custom, and before the Welsh Power, which has so often made itself felt behind English thrones, could intervene, compliance was promised. After that it remained for the Welsh Power to make our stay difficult, and our going easy.|$|E

However, according to Drummond, [...] "That's {{just the way it}} was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct."

[...] He charged {{that one of the most}} egregious aspects of the corruption was Ryan's action after learning that bribes were being paid for licenses. Instead of ending the practice he tried to end the investigation that had uncovered it, Fitzgerald said, calling the moment [...] "a low-water mark for public service." [...] Ryan became one of four Illinois governors since 1968 to be convicted of white-collar crimes, following Otto Kerner, Jr. and Dan Walker and followed by Rod Blagojevich.|$|R
