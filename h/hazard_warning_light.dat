40|$|The Mobile Millennium project {{provided}} {{a platform for}} aggregating traffic information across various sources, including infrastructure sensors, commercial data feeds, probe vehicles, and probe cell phones. The Networked Traveler project provided the California PATH instrumented research vehicle platform used to both deliver vehicle probe data back to the infrastructure and to generate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) alerts to the drivers of those vehicles. The main theme of this collaboration project was to demonstrate the potential to create Enhanced Probe Vehicles (EPVs) by merging vehicle CAN-bus data with the typical GPS data that is provided by normal probe vehicles. The first goal of this project was integrate the two systems, allowing the instrumented research vehicles {{to communicate with the}} Mobile Millennium traffic aggregation servers. The second goal was to enhance the data gathered and stored by the Mobile Millennium traffic aggregation server to include the enhanced information provided by the EPVs, specifically, to include <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> activation events. The third and final goal of this project was to integrate the information provided by the EPVs to the traffic server into soft-safety alerts that could be provided to the drivers of the EPVs and demonstrate the prototype system.

50|$|The {{bus station}} is {{relatively}} busy, and until 19/20 December 2009 {{there was only}} one stand for route 9. When two arrived at the same time, one went {{to the other side of}} the bus station on another stand, and then reversed all the way back along when the stand became free. Without a condition to use the <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> when reversing, this was sometimes quite hazardous. Over the weekend on 19/20 December, with the new Southern Vectis timetable, the stands were rearranged. Route 9 gained two stands, one for the Staplers leg, and the other for Fairlee (ironically after the frequency was decreased), and routes 2 and 3 were given a stand each.|$|R

A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk.

The existing Triumph Herald three-rail type gearbox {{was replaced with}} a Triumph Spitfire 1500 type single-rail gearbox and the car was fitted with a new clutch. The new look Toledo was also fitted with side body trims, new look black type front grille (replacing the silver type front grille) and a stainless trim {{was added to the}} side roof guttering. The specification again improved; standard equipment now included a rear-view dipping mirror, fasten seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> reclining front seats (previously an option), twin reversing lights (also previously an option), cigar <b>lighter,</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and a driver's exterior door mirror. A laminated windscreen, front head rests and brushed nylon seat facings were optional extras. The Toledo was finally replaced by the Dolomite 1300 and 1500 in March 1976. Total production was 119,182 cars, making it one of Triumph's best-selling small saloon cars.|$|R

5000|$|First {{production}} Audi with a Collision avoidance system: Pre sense (similar to Mercedes-Benz Pre-Safe). The full {{version of}} the system (Pre Sense Plus) works in four phases. In the first phase, the system provides warning of an impending accident, while the <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> are activated, the side windows and sunroof are closed and the front seat belts are tensioned. In the second phase, the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking {{at a rate of}} 3 m/s² (9.8 ft/s²). The fourth phase decelerates the car at 5 m/s² (16.4 ft/s²) followed by automatic deceleration at full braking power, roughly half a second before projected impact. A second system, called (Pre Sense Rear), is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The optional memory seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. The system uses sensor fusion with twin radar and a mono camera and was introduced in 2010.|$|R

5000|$|... 2013: Mercedes updated Pre-Safe on the W222 S-Class as plus with cross-traffic assist. Pre-Safe with {{pedestrian}} {{detection and}} City Brake function {{is a combination}} of stereo camera and radar sensors to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicle. Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a full brake application. Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about 72 km/h , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to 50 km/h. A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle.

[...] Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.|$|R

40|$|Abstract EVALUATING THE USE OF STEADY BURN WARNING LIGHTS ON DRUMS FOR WORK ZONE SAFETY by PRASAD LAKSHMI VARA NANNAPANENI May 2011 Advisor: Dr. Timothy Gates Major: Civil Engineering Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Roadway {{maintenance}} and repair has become increasingly commonplace in the United States {{over the past several}} decades as our roadway infrastructure has continued to age and deteriorate. Maintenance and repair work on an existing roadway often presents the challenge of maintaining traffic on the existing roadway while work is being performed, thereby necessitating the use of what is commonly referred to as a roadway 2 ̆ 2 work zone 2 ̆ 2. One of the most important components of traffic control in a work zone is delineation of the edge of the traveled way, which assists drivers with tasks such as: lane selection; lateral positioning within a lane; and speed control. Delineation of the edge of the traveled way is commonly provided by a series of portable devices, such as drums, cones, vertical panels, or barricades. The type and duration of the work being performed often requires that these channelizing devices remain in place at all times. Maintaining traffic through nighttime work zones poses increased risks for drivers and roadway workers due to the lack of ambient light. To help overcome nighttime visibility issues, the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) requires work zone traffic control devices to be retroreflective or internally illuminated. To help supplement retroreflectivity, Section 6 F. 81 of the 2009 MUTCD allows for the use of auxiliary steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> (SBWL) on work zone channelizing devices. Until recently, plastic drums with steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> had been the primary channelizing device utilized in work zones throughout the State of Michigan for several years. However, the use of sheeting materials with improved retroreflectivity, including high intensity and microprismatic (i. e., prismatic) materials, has prompted investigation into the value and effectiveness provided by the steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> Furthermore, although previous research has explored the effectiveness of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on drums both in Michigan and elsewhere, these efforts included a relatively limited number of work zone sites and/or focused on controlled human factors experiments. As a result, research was undertaken to explore the impacts associated with the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on channelizing drums considering a variety of work zone scenarios utilized in Michigan. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the safety impacts associated with the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on drums in roadway work zones in Michigan. The following research objectives were addressed in this study: 1. 	Determine the state-of-the-art of work zone channelization through a comprehensive literature review. 2. 	Determine the state-of-the-practice regarding the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> by roadway agencies throughout the United States. 3. 	Assess the crash experiences of states with respect to the work zone steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> policy or practice. 4. 	Evaluate the impacts that steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on channelizing drums have on work zone crash occurrence in Michigan. 5. 	Evaluate the driver behavioral impacts associated with the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on channelizing drums in Michigan work zones. 6. 	Determine the degree by which steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> affect the overall brightness of work zone drums in Michigan. 7. 	Assess the overall impacts of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on work zone safety. A comprehensive research methodology was developed to address these objectives. The initial tasks involved a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art and a state DOT survey related to the use of drums or other channelizing devices in roadway work zones, both with and without the presence of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> The next tasks involved a comparison of work zone crash trends, both among states with varying policies on the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights,</b> as well as a detailed investigation of crash data for work zones within the State of Michigan. To further supplement the crash data, a series of field studies were performed at 36 Michigan work zones to provide a more in-depth evaluation of differences in driver behavior and performance with respect to the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> In addition to these field studies, a series of luminance tests were also conducted to assess the relative brightness levels provided by drums with and without <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> The luminance tests were performed both in the field and in a controlled environment to gauge the impacts of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on drum visibility. Established sampling procedures were utilized to determine the target sample sizes necessary to assess statistical inference on the measures of effectiveness (MOEs). The data were collected for each study component under a variety of representative field conditions, which included different types of roadways, work zone configuration, levels of ambient lighting, roadway geometry, and other factors. Each of the MOEs were analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques to determine the impacts of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and the impacts of other factors. The results showed that the presence of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on work zone channelizing drums increased the occurrence of risky driver behavior, as evidenced by a higher proportion of drivers traveling too close to the drums, more frequent steering reversals, and higher vehicular speeds. These findings were further substantiated by the observance of a greater proportion of damaged drums at work zone locations with steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> Steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> were not found to provide substantial increases to the luminance of the drums either in the field or in a controlled environment. It was determined that the use of microprismatic sheeting materials provide considerably greater luminance increases for the drums compared to the addition of a steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> to the drum. The state DOT survey revealed that only approximately one-third of the 42 responding state agencies utilize steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on channelizing devices in work zones and only one-tenth of the responding agencies utilize them on a frequent basis. The majority of agencies that use steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> do so on an infrequent basis, typically for specific types of applications, such as at spot hazards, tapers, lane shifts, and crossovers. The investigation of nationwide work zone crash statistics revealed only slight differences between the rates of work zone crashes for the various steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> usage practices. The states that frequently use lights on drums exhibited a slightly higher aggregate work zone crash rate, while the states that infrequently use lights on drums had the lowest aggregate crash rate. No discernable differences were observed between any of the three groups of states when examining work zone crashes as a proportion of total crashes. A detailed review of Michigan work zone crash statistics revealed that a higher proportion of work zone crashes tended to occur during nighttime conditions at locations with steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> compared to locations without steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> Deeper investigation showed that among those crashes occurring in the presence of drums, the proportion of the crashes that may have been affected by the drums was indistinguishable between the two samples. Based on a synthesis of all results, steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> demonstrate no substantive value to nighttime brightness, driver behavior, or crash prevention when used on channelizing drums in work zones. Thus, it was concluded that steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> demonstrate no additional safety benefit when used on channelizing drums in work zones. Furthermore, steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> may actually contribute to a greater crash risk due to the increase in risky driver behavior that was observed when steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> were present. Drums with high intensity sheeting that is in good condition will provide adequate nighttime brightness for work zone channelization regardless of whether a steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> is attached or not. Therefore, it is recommended that the use of steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> on work zone drums be discontinued. If additional nighttime brightness of the channelizing devices is desired, the use of microprismatic sheeting on the drums provides far greater increases in brightness than the addition of a steady burn <b>warning</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
