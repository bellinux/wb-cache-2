30|$|These studies usefully {{show that}} there are changes in the {{physical}} properties of parchment artefacts at different RH {{and this may be}} caused by the proportion of collagen and gelatine present in the parchment. Unfortunately neither Schillings nor Dernovšková’s study used a large enough sample set to provide sufficient data for the broad spectrum of parchment artefacts. Schilling only used DSS samples, which validates the results for a very specific sample set, and Dernovšková’s study only compared goat parchments from 1550  AD. Therefore, these sample sets need to be augmented by further studies to generalise the case and be representative of the range of parchment artefacts in terms of manufacturing procedures, animal skins used or the type of post manufacture storage conditions. In addition, techniques need to be developed to estimate the amount of collagen and gelatine in each sample and relate this to the physical changes observed at different RH values, although the properties of the structural components of parchment (<b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> <b>collagen)</b> have been characterised in part by response to RH, {{there is a need to}} consider the spatial relationship of collagen and gelatine at a variety of length scales within each parchment.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveOsteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal diseases. Collagen derivatives are candidates for disease-modifying OA drugs. This group of derivatives can be divided into undenatured collagen (UC), <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> <b>collagen</b> hydrolysate (CH). Collagen derivatives are marketed as having direct chondroprotective action and reducing complaints of OA. This review summarizes the evidence for the effectiveness of symptomatic and chondroprotective treatment with collagen derivatives in patients with OA. MethodsEligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until November 2011. Methodological quality was assessed using methods of the Cochrane Back Review Group. ResultsEight studies were identified: six on CH, two on gelatine, and one on UC. The pooled mean difference based on three studies for pain reduction measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index comparing CH with placebo was − 0. 49 (95 % CI − 1. 10 – 0. 12). However, some studies report significant between-group differences in pain when measured with a visual analogical scale (VAS) or other instruments, or when CH is compared with glucosamine sulphate. For disability no significant between-group mean differences were found when comparing CH with placebo. Gelatine compared with placebo and with alternative therapies was superior for the outcome pain. UC compared with glucosamine+chondroitin showed no significant between-group differences for pain and disability. The most reported adverse events of collagen derivatives were mild to moderate gastro-intestinal complaints. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low. ConclusionsThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the generalized use of CHs in daily practice for the treatment of patients with OA. More independent high-quality studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic effects of collagen derivatives on OA complaints...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} {{a serious problem}} for {{patients}} with burns and other wounds. Such burn wound infection accounts for the pathogenic bacteria by colonising onto burned areas. Therefore, the need for detection and inhibition of such bacterial colonisation requires a methodology for sensing/killing pathogenic bacteria. This research project aims to design a ‗smart‘ wound dressing system which can respond to the microbiological environment of the wound via a simple colour change and will release antimicrobials only when required. Two strains of pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 476) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO 1) {{were used in the}} study. The non-pathogenic bacterium E. coli (DH 5 α) was used as a control organism as it does not secrete virulence factors and therefore does not lyse membranes of vesicles. The key contributions of this thesis are outlined below. Firstly, an initial responsive nanocapsule system was studied. The fundamental work with giant unilamellar vesicles proved such a responsive system can provide antimicrobial properties when antimicrobial agents were encapsulated within the vesicles. Secondly, partially polymerised vesicles—polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles were then developed to improve vesicle stability. The vesicle system was optimised by varying molar concentration of diacetylene monomers (TCDA) in order to obtain relatively stable vesicles as well as sensitivity to the toxins secreted by the pathogenic strains. Measurements proved that the polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles can respond to pathogenic bacteria when fluorescent dye/antimcirobials were encapsulated in the vesicles. Finally, a simple prototype dressing was constructed. Plasma polymerised maleic anhydride (pp-MA) deposited onto non-woven polypropylene was shown to be a good method to stabilise vesicles via covalent bonding. Vesicle adhered to pp-MA non-woven polypropylene showed the ability to inhibit/kill the pathogenic strains, quantified by the Japanese Industry Standard assay and also gave a fluorimetric colour response in the presence of pathogenic bacteria when a fluorescent dye is encapsulated within vesicles. Other simple prototypes were also attempted by using hydrogels (<b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> <b>collagen)</b> to maintain vesicle stability as well as promote tissue healing...|$|E

30|$|Parchment {{artefacts}} {{are composed}} of collagen, its degraded form gelatine, varying minerals, lipids, and for documents inks and paints. The main structural components are <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> are both hygroscopic. Changes to the relative proportions of <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> (that may be mediated through adverse storage conditions and accelerated by the effects of lipids, or inks) contribute to the dominant effect of the mechanical properties of a parchment. It {{has also been shown}} that the high quantities of gelatine are related to physical features of parchment that may be undesirable, such as cockling [1]. Understanding the relationship between the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of parchment structure and water content is therefore critical to establishing appropriate temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) conditions for the storage, display, and preservation of parchment artefacts. When establishing these parameters, {{it is important for the}} structural organisation of <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> to be considered because water interaction with collagen is found to be different to gelatine (discussed later).|$|R

40|$|This study {{involves}} the preparation, microstructural, physical, mechanical, and biological characterization of novel <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> gelatine/elastin gels {{for their use}} in the tissue engineering of vascular grafts. <b>Gelatine</b> <b>and</b> gelatine/elastin nanocomposite gels were prepared via a sol-gel process, using soluble gelatine. Gelatine was subsequently cross-linked by leaving the gels in 1 % glutaraldehyde. The cross-linking time was optimized by assessing the mass loss of the cross-linked gels in water and examining their mechanical properties in dynamic mechanical tests. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies revealed elastin nanodomains, homogeneously distributed and embedded in a bed of gelatine nanofibrils in the 30 / 70 elastin/gelatine gel. It was concluded that the manufactured nanocomposite gels resembled natural arteries in terms of microstructure and stiffness.

30|$|We {{postulate}} {{that the}} differences in water content between the collagen gelatine phases within parchment is a critical link when determining appropriate RH conditions for the storage, handling and display of parchment. The specific interaction between water <b>and</b> <b>collagen</b> {{at different levels of}} molecular and supramolecular structure means that changes in water content will induce well described and characteristic structural changes at each level; however in gelatine, the lack of conformational specificity means that changes in water content can only be described by the relative level in the proximity and entanglement of the collagen polypeptide chains. The gelatine-collagen stratigraphy within parchment may mean that the difference in water content at any given RH could cause differences in the cohesion between these structural phases [24, 25]. It is also possible that the difference in structural stability between the <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> phases could affect mechanical properties within parchment inducing a stress at the interfaces between <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine.</b> If the changes in water exposure are cyclic, the stress imposed could eventually lead to mechanical fatigue and fracture, this would be a feed forward mechanism in which collagen is further damaged <b>and</b> converts to <b>gelatine.</b> Because the <b>collagen,</b> <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> interface layers will absorb different amounts of water at the same RH, there will be a differential distribution of water at any given RH typically used in storage conditions; an alteration in the RH will cause the water distribution and the physical properties of the different components to change [26]. The effect that the disparity between water content of <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> has on parchment stability is not clear, and needs to be resolved. Electron micrograph images of parchment surfaces show a delamination of a glassy surface layer of parchment that has separated in parts from the underlying core of the parchment. These fractures are possible representative of differential behaviour of layers and interfaces within the parchment document [27].|$|R

30|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the need to}} understand the effects of relative humidity on parchment and the current understanding of parchment structure and hydration. It also provides a critical evaluation of the body of foregoing research investigating the effects of relative humidity on parchment artefacts. The critical evaluation shows that the current scientific evidence {{that can be used to}} inform the debate with regard to relative humidity guidelines for the preservation of parchment artefacts is insufficient, especially in the light of a greater understanding of parchment based documents when considered as composite materials comprising <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine.</b> The differential behaviour of <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> (<b>and</b> consequently the effect on the interfaces between them) in terms of response to relative humidity changes, is proposed as a key factor to be considered for future studies.

30|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that ATR-FTIR {{can be used to}} determine conformational changes of the <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> components within parchment artefacts and determine if structural degradation has taken place [14].

Therefore differences in the wavenumber of absorptions bandings can be used to determine if exposure to X-rays has altered the conformation of the <b>collagen</b> <b>and</b> <b>gelatine</b> components of parchment.|$|R
40|$|The {{gelation}} of gelatine {{in mixtures}} of gelatine (type A or type B) and globular proteins (Whey Protein Isolate (WPI), Whey Protein Aggregates (WPA) and Soy Protein Isolate (SPI)) was studied {{with a focus}} on their phase separation during gelation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, visual observations and rheology were used to link the changes on a microscopic scale to macroscopic gel properties (visual appearance and gel stiffness). An increase in storage modulus G' compared to single gelatine gels was observed for protein mixtures containing <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> SPI or <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> WPA. This could be related to segregative phase separation between proteins during gelatine gelation as detected by CLSM and visual observations. In protein mixtures without phase separation (Gelatine/WPI mixtures) the storage modulus G' of the gels was the same as in pure gelatine gels. Since all protein mixtures were prepared at an ionic strength of 150 mM, where the electrostatic interactions were screened, the occurrence of phase separation was attributed to the excluded volume interaction between <b>gelatines</b> <b>and</b> globular proteins. </p...|$|R

Variations in epithelium components of micro and nano sizes lead to initial pathological changes appearance. To fix the influence of such changes on diffuse- reflected light on the tissue surface, the experimental and theoretical studies were conducted. Materials and methods: For the experimental part multi-layers synthetic phantoms were made for mimicking absorbing and diffusing optical properties of the bladder mucosa. A substance with <b>gelatine</b> <b>and</b> Intralipid was taken as a basic constituent of our medium. Polymer micro- and nanospheres of different diameter were used as scatterers.
