5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean Linear B script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{fossil record}} of Acochlidiacea. Application of a {{molecular}} clock allowed estimation of divergence times for these groups.

The most primitive of these, e.g. on the tyrannosauroid Dilong, were simply hollow-cored fibres that would have been useful for insulation but useless for flying.|$|E

25|$|In Ireland the {{commencement}} of the Iron Age around 600 BC is generally believed {{to coincide with the}} first appearance in this country of Celtic-speaking peoples. There is little archaeological evidence to support the theory of a large-scale Celtic invasion (or series of invasions), but {{it is quite possible that}} small groups of migrants, highly skilled in the art of war and armed with superior iron weaponry, were powerful enough to gain a foothold in the island and eventually succeeded in subjugating or absorbing the pre-Celtic natives; in the 12th century of the Common Era small bands of heavily armed Anglo-Normans did just this, so there is no conceivable reason why it could not also <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-Christian era.|$|E
25|$|Some myths {{may have}} been {{inspired}} by historical events. The unification of Egypt under the pharaohs, {{at the end of the}} Predynastic Period around 3100 BC, made the king the focus of Egyptian religion, and thus the ideology of kingship became an important part of mythology. In the wake of unification, gods that were once local patron deities gained national importance, forming new relationships that linked the local deities into a unified national tradition. Geraldine Pinch suggests that early myths may have formed from these relationships. Egyptian sources link the mythical strife between the gods Horus and Set with a conflict between the regions of Upper and Lower Egypt, which may <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Predynastic era or in the Early Dynastic Period.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{important}} for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called additionality. The concept of additionality addresses {{the question of whether}} the project would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of an intervention in the form of the price signal of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this price signal (holding all other factors constant), represent a net environmental benefit. Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of additionality requires a careful investigation of proposed carbon offset projects.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{fair chance}} of snow {{earlier in the season}} when {{temperatures}} are colder - often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Italian Marines {{based on}} the tanker Enrica Lexie {{allegedly}} fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala, killing two of her eleven crew. The Marines allegedly mistook the fishing vessel as a pirate vessel. The incident sparked a diplomatic row between India and Italy. Enrica Lexie was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police. The fact is still sub juris and its legal eventual outcome could influence future deployment of VPDs, since states will be either encouraged or discouraged to provide them depending on whether functional immunity is ultimately granted or denied to the Italians.Another similar incident {{has been reported to}} <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea between the coasts of Somalia and Yemen, involving the death of a Yemeni fisherman allegedly {{at the hands of a}} Russian Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) on board a Norwegian-flagged vessel.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E

500|$|According to Luca Codignola of the University of Genoa, {{contact with}} a {{powerful}} extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of Christopher Columbus and HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life. However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of {{the arrival of the}} European colonists to the Americas, have been disputed. Even so, any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society.

500|$|A {{number of}} outlets {{expressed}} disappointment at the penalty shoot-out, {{in particular the}} way that Martin Williams, who as a flanker who would not ordinarily take a kick at goal, had been to [...] "blame" [...] for Cardiff's loss. The Guardians Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal [...] "is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi-final into a pantomime, an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue." [...] Brendan Gallagher writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that {{only three or four}} players on a rugby team would kick the ball during a match in a meaningful way, and said it was [...] "ludicrous that a game should be decided by emphasising that particular skill". He also questioned what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event the shoot-out continued and the game been decided between props Martin Castrogiovanni and Gethin Jenkins, both considered amongst the finest players in their position but never ordinarily being required to kick the ball at goal. Chris Hewett expressed similar views in The Independent, observing that Martyn Williams [...] "lost the game by failing to perform a task outside the skill-set of the majority of players" [...] and commenting that [...] "short of asking a cat to bark, {{it is hard to imagine}} anything more preposterous." ...|$|E

Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E
