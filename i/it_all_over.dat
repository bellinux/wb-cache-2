5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> Again, I'd Do <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy the Ray Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It was the last resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater wreckage of the Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt the Ray line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Filgaia, throwing {{the forces of nature}} into chaos. It is also revealed that one of the Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E

25|$|Dyczkowski (1988: p.26) {{holds that}} Hāla's Prakrit {{literature}} poem the Gāthāsaptaśati (third to fifth century CE) {{is one of}} the first extant literary references to a Kapalika where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover. This is a literary allusion to the anointing of 'sacred ash' (Sanskrit: bhasma; vibhuti) especially associated with Shiva who applies <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> his body.|$|E
25|$|Bailey premiered {{his show}} Part Troll at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. A {{critical}} and commercial success, he then transferred {{it to the}} West End, where tickets sold out in under 24 hours, and new dates had to be added. He continued to tour <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the UK {{as well as in}} the US, Australia and New Zealand. Bailey expanded on subjects such as the war on Iraq. He also talks extensively about drugs, at one point asking the audience to name different ways of baking cannabis. A DVD was released in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to {{think of himself as}} a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|E

In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers. In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem.

500|$|This lila is a {{constant}} theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts {{as if he were}} playing a game.

A writer from the South Wales Echo gave a positive review, saying that GHV2 is [...] "an essential pop album" [...] and [...] "truly immaculate". MusicOMH's Michael Hubbard complimented {{the inclusion of}} [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" [...] from Evita and [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] from the Austin Powers sequel , saying that they [...] "are worthy inclusions... compiling this collection didn't require much imagination, the end result does the job—the CD is exactly what it says on the tin." ...|$|E

[...] Prof. Trueblood is the {{inventor}} of the novel scheme, and his course, which has been hitherto shunned as one of the toughest at the university, now seems likely to become the most popular on campus... Early this week he hit upon the successful plan, and now the many visitors who attend his classes are spectators of thrilling love scenes. [...] Fifty times a day Prof. Trueblood is forced to kneel to some maiden and show his pupils the right way to declare their devotion to their sweethearts... Each budding orator takes his place before a blushing maid, and no matter how smoothly the pair may have progressed in private the professor finds some fault with the public demonstration. [...] 'No, kneel on both knees—now hold her hand, it impresses her more-so,' and the old professor again kneels and goes through <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again." ...|$|E

But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1891 the Great Northern Railway {{crossed the}} Continental Divide at Marias Pass , which is along the {{southern}} boundary of the park. In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad, the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public. The company lobbied the United States Congress. In 1897 the park was designated as a forest preserve. Under the forest designation, mining was still allowed but was not commercially successful. Meanwhile, proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts. In 1910, {{under the influence of}} the Boone and Crockett Club, spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell, Henry L. Stimson, and the railroad, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park. This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11, 1910. In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote, [...] "This Park, the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club, whose members discovered the region, suggested it being set aside, caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} {{originality}} {{of the title}} character's song in the first act about {{the head of a}} railway company, which may have been a joke about the Duke of Sutherland, [...] "who was fond of running railway engines". Scott called the song a [...] "ludicrous ballad", but [...] "quite {{in the spirit of the}} well-known compositions of 'Bab,' and, as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus, a hearty encore was inevitable. Though the ditty was long, the audience would have been well content to hear <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette found the orchestration [...] "very novel, including, as it does, the employment of a railway bell, a railway whistle, and some new instrument of music imitating the agreeable sound of a train in motion." [...] Similarly The Sunday Times noted, [...] "The entire company join in the chorus, the music of which admirably expresses the whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed." [...] The Era called it [...] "a screaming, whistling and shouting chorus [...] fairly brings down the house".|$|E
500|$|During 1957 Gielgud {{directed}} Berlioz's The Trojans at Covent Garden {{and played}} Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production {{central to his}} career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show The Ages of Man. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: [...] "You've {{no idea how much}} easier it is without a Juliet. When there's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull out all the stops to get any attention." [...] His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.|$|E
