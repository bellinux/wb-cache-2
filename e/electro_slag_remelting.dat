40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis work was to {{establish}} a fatigue-test setup and perform several tests to characterize different combinations of steels and heat treatments. These materials should be suited for usage as cam ring material in hydraulic drives. Carring out the tests {{in a short time}} {{was one of the main}} features for the selection of the test-method. For characterizing the materials the Standing Contact Fatigue method was choosen. In this method, the sample is pressed against a hard ball in rapid succession causing different types of cracks in the contact-zone. The contact area was inspected after each test. Since a continuation of a performed test is not possible, a following test was carried out with more or less cylces, depending on the previous result (cracks found or no cracks present). In addition, a strain-gauge set-up was established for testing an insitu crack detection. Mostly ring-cone cracks were found at the edge of the indentation but inside the indent. The sectional view shows, that these crack grow underneath the indentation. The tests, performed at 60 Hz and a load cycle between 500 N and 15 kN, show a higher fatigue limit for the samples tempered at 240 °C than the samples at 180 °C.

Improvement of working properties provides remelted processes above an <b>electro</b> <b>slag</b> <b>remelting</b> (ESR). The slags play very important role by ESR process.

40|$|Tool steels are {{required}} to show high hardness and fracture toughness, as well as good wear resistance. Furthermore, other properties such as chipping and contact fatigue resistance are also essential {{in order to improve}} the life-time of the tool. The goal of this thesis is to analyze the chipping and contact fatigue resistance of several steels and try to evaluate the correlation between these two properties. On the one hand, the performance of different ausferritic or carbide-free bainitic steels as tool steels have been studied, by taking a high-silicon steel and subjecting it to two austempering treatments, to evaluate their properties next. On the other hand, several quenched & tempered commercial tool steel have been evaluated, produced either by conventional metallurgy, powder metallurgy or <b>electro</b> <b>slag</b> <b>remelting.</b> The microstructure and microhardness of all the steels have been studied first, and standing contact fatigue tests have been performed next. Finally, with the obtained results, the relation between the chipping resistance and contact fatigue resistance has been evaluated. Among the commercial tool steels Calmax, Vanadis 4 Extra and Caldie show much better standing contact fatigue resistance than AISI D 2. Ausferritic steels have also shown good resistance, comparable to the Calmax or, in some cases, even better. Regarding the microhardness, ausferritc steels are not as hard as the commercial tool steels, but the values are not much lower than Calmax or AISI D 2 for example. Finally, Caldie, the steel with the highest standing contact fatigue resistance shows, according to the provider, the best chipping resistance. The presented work has brought some insight to the evaluation of tool steels.

Starting with an {{ultimate tensile strength}} of 650 MPa, the material has recorded a tensile strength of 1250 - 1300 MPa corresponding to a percentage thickness reduction of 88. It has been observed that material with higher impurity, levels and inclusion ratings are more vulnerable to development of micro cracks at higher percentage thickness reduction. Deformed inclusions like MnS act as stress raisers leading to initiation of micro cracks.

Therefore, modelling of freckle formation {{is an important}} task for optimizing industrial remelting processes. Practically all present freckle models {{are based on a}} critical Rayleigh number. They are inspired by the “classical” assumption that freckles are caused by an inversion of the liquid density in the semisolid region. Plumes of the lighter segregated liquid evolve through perturbation of the metastable layering of the melt in the mushy zone, a mechanism which motivates its description via Rayleigh criteria. But these models are not suitable for materials like Alloy 718 which do not show a liquid density inversion, but nevertheless are prone to freckle formation in technical remelting processes. In this paper, a criterion is developed which – instead of using a Rayleigh number – is based on the evaluation of the non-isothermal component of an instantaneous down-hill flow of heavy segregated melt in a melt pool with axial symmetry. With knowledge of the exact pool geometry and the shape and properties of the mushy zone, the occurrence of freckles can be predicted. The model is applied to a technical ESR casting for which temperature fields and microstructural parameters have been obtained using CFD and 3 D phase-field modelling, respectively. Furthermore, the implications are discussed which the new model offers for the understanding of freckles in technical remelting processes...|$|R
40|$|Finite element (FE) {{models that}} simulates the ductile {{fracture}} {{process in a}} tool steel has been developed {{in order to determine}} the influence of the carbides on the ductility. The studied steel is an uphill ingot cast, <b>Electro</b> <b>Slag</b> Refined (ESR) and hot worked tool steel with a low fraction of carbides, so called matrix type tool steel. The microstructure consists of a steel matrix with high toughness and brittle carbides, which are approximately half a ìm in size with an almost spherical shape. An experimental four-point bending test has been carried out in order to establish the ductility properties of the steel and a FE-model of the four- point bending test has been designed for the calculations of the macroscopic deformations. A subsequent FE-model of the microstructure of the material has been designed based on Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) pictures. The matrix has been modelled as elastic-plastic and the carbides have been considered to be elastic. A failure criterion has been applied to the matrix, which eliminates an element from the mesh when the plastic strain exceeds a critical level. The FE-model of the microstructure has been loaded so that cracks have been generated and the load has been applied until total failure. SEM pictures of the fracture surface show that carbides above a critical size crack during the fracture process while smaller carbides remain intact. Different models of describing the failure at the carbides have been evaluated: i) intact carbides fixed to the matrix, ii) intact carbides with no cohesion to the matrix and iii) carbides with internal cracks. Several combinations of the failure models have been simulated. Failure curves from the simulations of the microstructure model have been evaluated in order to establish the strain at failure, which has been compared to the strain at failure of the FE-model of the four-point bending test. A very satisfactory agreement between the experimental ductility and the simulations has been obtained. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{involves the}} measurement of the electrical conductivity (K) for the ESR (electroslag <b>remelting)</b> <b>slag</b> (60 wt. % CaF{sub 2 } - 20 wt. % CaO - 20 wt. % Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) used in the decontamination of radioactive stainless steel. The electrical conductivity is measured with an improved high-accuracy-height-differential technique that requires no calibration. This method consists of making continuous AC impedance measurements over several successive depth increments of the coaxial cylindrical electrodes in the ESR slag. The electrical conductivity is then calculated from {{the slope of the}} plot of inverse impedance versus the depth of the electrodes in the slag. The improvements on the existing technique include an increased electrochemical cell geometry and the capability of measuring high precision depth increments and the associated impedances. These improvements allow this technique to be used for measuring the electrical conductivity of highly conductive slags such as the ESR slag. The volatilization rate and the volatile species of the ESR slag measured through thermogravimetric (TG) and mass spectroscopy analysis, respectively, reveal that the ESR slag composition essentially remains the same throughout the electrical conductivity experiments...|$|R
