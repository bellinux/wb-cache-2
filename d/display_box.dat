5|$|The SaGa Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a <b>display</b> <b>box</b> for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from the SaGa series, with All Sounds of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already have most of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified for everyone who liked just some of the music of the SaGa series.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Emin was commissioned, {{as part of}} {{a scheme}} {{throughout}} London titled Art in Sacred Spaces, to collaborate with children on an artwork at Ecclesbourne Primary School in Islington, north London. Pupils made the piece with her in Emin's style of sewing cut out letters onto a large piece of material. In 2004 the school enquired if Emin would sign the work so that the school could sell it as an original to raise funds. They planned to auction the piece for £35,000 for an arts unit, as it could not afford to display the large work. Emin and her gallery White Cube refused saying {{that it was not a}} piece of her art, therefore reducing its value, and requested it be returned. But Emin quickly came to an agreement with the school, where she paid £4,000 to create a perspex <b>display</b> <b>box</b> for the patchwork quilt to be showcased. Taking as her theme the title [...] "Tell me something beautiful", Emin invited eight-year-olds to nominate their ideas of beauty and then to sew the keywords in felt letters on bright fabric squares. The resulting bold patchwork featured words such as [...] "tree", [...] "sunrise", [...] "dolphin" [...] and [...] "nan".|$|E

Early box colors were blue with white lettering or yellow with black lettering. Later boxes were simpler flimsier cardboard in a cream tone with blue lettering and plastic paper windows. By that time, the hard plastic clear acrylic <b>display</b> <b>boxes</b> were apparently no longer offered.|$|R
