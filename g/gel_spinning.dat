40|$|Sol <b>gel</b> <b>spin</b> coating {{method has}} been {{successfully}} employed for the deposition of nanocrystalline nickel oxide (NiO) thin films. The films were annealed at 400 ˚C- 700 ˚C for 1 h in an air {{and changes in the}} structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties were studied. The structural properties of nickel oxide films were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD analysis shows that all the films are crystal-lized in the cubic phase and present a random orientation. Surface morphology of the nickel oxide film consists of na-nocrystalline grains with uniform coverage of the substrate surface with randomly oriented morphology. The electrical conductivity showed the semiconducting nature with room temperature electrical conductivity increased from 10 - 4 to 10 − 2 (Ωcm) − 1 after annealing. The decrease in the band gap energy from 3. 86 to 3. 47 eV was observed after annealing NiO films from 400 ˚C- 700 ˚C. These mean that the optical quality of NiO films is improved by annealing...|$|R
