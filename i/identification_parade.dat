25|$|George {{appeared}} before the Old Bailey on 14 December 2007 and again {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder. His retrial began on 9 June 2008. Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in social skills and a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice Griffith Williams). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) {{as a result of the}} enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and one of the jurors. For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change.

40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} {{multiple}} perpetrator crimes being committed is increasing {{both in the}} UK and around the world. In response to this, the number of multiple perpetrator <b>identifications</b> <b>parades</b> (‘multiple suspect showings’) conducted by the police in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are increasing. However, at present in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Police and Criminal EvidenceAct, Codes of Practice (2011) provides little guidance for the procedures of ‘multiple suspect showings’. This research involved a questionnaire sent to the identification unit of each police force across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. With 29 responses, {{it is clear to}} see the variants across forces with regards to procedure and instructions given. The affects of these deviations from the guidelines for eyewitness identification performance are discussed. Suggestions for improvements to the current procedures are also examined...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 239 - 248. This thesis {{addresses}} a practical problem. The problem concerns {{the evaluation of}} 'identification parades', or 'lineups', which are frequently used by police to secure evidence of identification. It is well recognised that this evidence is frequently unreliable, and has led on occasion to tragic miscarriages of justice. A review of South African law is conducted and reported in the thesis, and shows that the legal treatment of <b>identification</b> <b>parades</b> centres on the requirement that parades should be composed of people of similar appearance to the suspect. I {{argue that it is}} not possible, in practice, to assess whether this requirement has been met and that this is a significant failing. Psychological work on <b>identification</b> <b>parades</b> includes the development of measures of parade fairness, and the investigation of alternate lineup structures. Measures of parade fairness suggested in the literature are indirectly derived, though; and I argue that they fail to address the question of physical similarity. In addition, I develop ways of reasoning inferentially (statistically) with measures of parade fairness, and suggest a new measure of parade fairness. The absence of a direct measure of similarity constitutes the rationale for the empirical component of the thesis. I propose a measure of facial similarity, in which the similarity of two faces is defined as the Euclidean distance between them in a principal component space, or representational basis. (The space is determined by treating a set of digitized faces as numerical vectors, and by submitting these to principal component analysis). A similar definition is provided for 'facial distinctiveness', namely as the distance of a face from the origin or centroid of the space. The validity of the proposed similarity measure is investigated in several ways, in a total of seven studies, involving approximately 700 subjects. 350 frontal face images and 280 profile face images were collected for use as experimental materials, and as the source for the component space underlying the similarity measure. The weight of the evidence, particularly from a set of similarity rating tasks, suggests that the measure corresponds reasonably well to perceptions of facial similarity. Results from a mock witness experiment showed that it is also strongly, and monotonically related to standard measures of lineup fairness. Evidence from several investigations of the distinctiveness measure, on the other hand, showed that it {{does not appear to be}} related to perceptions of facial distinctiveness. An additional empirical investigation examined the relation between target-foil similarity and identification performance. Performance was greater for lineups of low similarity, both when the perpetrator was present, and when the perpetrator was absent. The consequences of this for the understanding of lineup construction and evaluation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A ZLRev. {{article on}} the legal {{pros and cons of}} face <b>identification</b> <b>parades</b> in {{criminal}} investigations. Witnesses to a crime are often required to identify a suspect from a police line-up or photo spread. Positive identification of a suspect made under oath and with confidence by one or more witnessess is usually considered to be strong evidence that the suspect is indeed the criminal. However, cases of mistaken identity sometimes do occur, often with disasterous consequences for the misidentified persons and their families (e. g. the cases of John Demjanjuk, Laszlo Virag, Frank Walus & Marinus de Rijke — see Wagenaar, 1988, pp 1 - 30). In recent years, applied research on the psychological processes involved in human memory has contributed significantly {{to our understanding of the}} sources of erroneous identifications in criminal investigations. However, research on developmental trends in face identification ability has been sparse. In this article, we report the results of two experiments in which children and adults's face recognition and identification performance were examined. Findings from both experiments showed that: (i) face recognition performance and face identification ability are skills that develop and improve as a function of increasing age, (ii) the probability of false recognitions occurring in a police line-up or photo spread is smaller for faces with distinctive features and/or feature configurations than it is for typical or 'average-looking' faces, and (iii) when the 'to-be-remembered' face is distinctive in appearance, children as young as 6 - 7 years are no more likely to make face identification errors than are adults. The practical implications of these findings for face identification procedures in criminal investigations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{confidence}} witnesses {{experience in}} their selection decisions, when participating in formal <b>identification</b> <b>parades,</b> {{has been the}} subject of much criminological research. The findings suggest that confidence is far from being a static construct; instead it is understood to be highly malleable and capable of being ameliorated by post-identification information. Although the effects of post-event feedback are well documented, no research has been conducted that establishes the nature and extent of information passed to witnesses by police investigators in real crime case scenarios. The dissertation reviews the current training provision for detectives and establishes an absence of any official guidance in regard to the information that should or should not be provided to witnesses post-identification. This is indicative of the current belief that witness confidence is conceptualised as being outside of the control of the criminal justice system. The research in this thesis challenges this position and suggests that information provided by police investigators is capable of affecting witness confidence, and, in addition, is also wholly capable of being placed within the scope of statutory control. The research establishes the views and practices of operational investigators and concludes that witnesses are frequently provided with positive reinforcement. The altering of witness confidence in this way has serious ramification for the judicial system, meaning that the confidence a witness displays at trial is unlikely to be indicative of that they experienced at the point of identification. In my conclusion I suggest that witness confidence should be understood as being equally susceptible to contamination as any other form of forensic evidence. That being the case, its management should be safeguarded within a legal framework and subject to intrusive scrutiny to establish its integrity at court...|$|R

In addition, we investigated factors that could explain any potential difficulties with identification performance, such as face recognition performance (as measured by a standardised test), eyewitness confidence, understanding of the purpose of a line-up, and memory for non-biased line-up instructions. In comparison with typical adults, participants with ID demonstrated poorer performance across both perpetrator-present and perpetrator-absent photographic line-ups, yet were more confident in the accuracy of their responses. In addition they had poorer face recognition performance, were less likely to understand the purpose of the line-up, and were less likely to remember the non-biased line-up instructions.

5000|$|Uncertainty {{following}} {{the tour of}} the territory by the Monckton Commission of Inquiry into {{the future of the}} Federation and the visit of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, led to an increase in politically motivated violence and intimidation. At Ndola on 8 May 1960 police dispersed an unauthorised public meeting and made 127 arrests in dealing with subsequent disorder. Mrs Lillian Burton was driving her daughters home when she was forced to stop by a mob. The windows of her car were smashed and petrol splashed over her and ignited. Her spaniel was burnt alive but Mrs Burton and her daughters, aged 12 and 5, escaped from the car to be brutally assaulted. They were found by a Forest Ranger and taken to hospital where Mrs Burton died. The officer leading the investigation recorded, [...] "Never during my twenty-seven years police career in Africa have I experienced such profound fear as prevailed in witnesses' minds during this investigation". One witness was found in Southern Rhodesia and an aircraft of the Police Reserve Flight used to intercept a bus on the Tanganyika border. 22 witnesses with their families were housed under police guard. 400 statements were recorded and cross checked. At 3am on 28 May, fourteen suspects were arrested in a concerted operation. <b>Identification</b> <b>parades</b> were held at which the witnesses were hooded. Disproving an alibi required a visit to the Congo and the co-operation of the Katanga Police. Four men werecharged with murder. For the re-assurance of witnesses the Preliminary Inquiry was adjourned to Solwezi 300 miles away, requiring a major logistic and security operation. On 17 August the trial opened at Ndola before Mr Justice Somerhough and four assessors. All four accused were legally represented. On 26 September after 11,605 pages of evidence had been recorded from 61 witnesses, Prosecuting Counsel had to withdraw through illness. Before he could be replaced, Mr Justice Somerhough died. A new trial opened on 8 November. Due to the situation in the Congo the attendance of five witnesses from Katanga could not be secured but statutory provisions enabled their evidence recorded at the aborted trial to be placed before the Court. All four accused were convicted. In July 1961 their appeals to The Federal Supreme Court were dismissed. Their petitions to Appeal to The Privy Council were rejected and they were hanged.|$|R

He even threatens to arrest Vishwanathan, if he decides to move ahead with the complaint. Vishwanathan, who goes crazy of anger, gets into a scuffle with Sudhakar, and kills him, which causes his father Reddy, who is now ruling the city, to hunt for Vishwanathan. He is saved by the rival mafia don Patel (Devan). Vishwanathan is made to stay at a brothel run by Patel, where he meets Appu (Maniyanpilla Raju), a good hearted chap. At the brothel, he is shocked to see Gowri, with whom he had a crush on the bus on the road to Hyderabad. From Appu, he comes to know that she was trapped and kidnapped at Tirupathi and has been sold to Patel by a lady pimp (Lalithasree). On meeting Vishwanathan, Gowri pleads him to save her.
