40|$|Peatlands {{cover more}} than 30 % of the Finnish land area and impact N 2 O fluxes. Denitrifiers release N 2 O as an {{intermediate}} or end product. In situ N 2 O emissions of a near pH neutral pristine <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> in Finnish Lapland were marginal during gas chamber measurements. However, nitrate and ammonium fertilization significantly stimulated in situ N 2 O emissions. Stimulation with nitrate was stronger than with ammonium. N 2 O was produced and subsequently consumed in gas chambers. In unsupplemented anoxic microcosms, <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> produced N 2 O only when acetylene was added to block nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting complete denitrification. Nitrate and nitrite stimulated denitrification in <b>fen</b> <b>soil,</b> and maximal reaction velocities (vmax) of nitrate or nitrite dependent denitrification where 18 and 52 nmol N 2 O h- 1 gDW- 1, respectively. N 2 O was below 30 % of total produced N gases in <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> when concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were < 500 μM. vmax for N 2 O consumption was up to 36 nmol N 2 O h- 1 gDW- 1. Denitrifier diversity was assessed by analyses of narG, nirK/nirS, and nosZ (encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases, respectively) by barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing. Analyses of ~ 14, 000 quality filtered sequences indicated up to 25 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and up to 359 OTUs at 97 % sequence similarity, suggesting diverse denitrifiers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clusters distantly related to publicly available sequences, suggesting hitherto unknown denitrifiers. Representatives of species-level OTUs were affiliated with sequences of unknown soil bacteria and Actinobacterial, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacterial sequences. Comparison of the 4 gene markers at 97 % similarity indicated a higher diversity of narG than for the other gene markers based on Shannon indices and observed number of OTUs. The collective data indicate (i) a high denitrification and N 2 O consumption potential, and (ii) a highly diverse, nitrate limited denitrifier community associated with potential N 2 O fluxes in a pH-neutral <b>fen</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{studying}} the influence of N-fertilization on N₂ and N₂O flux rates in relation to soil bacterial community composition of a long-term fertilization experiment in fen peat grassland, a strain group was isolated that was related to a strain isolated from a spacecraft assembly clean room during diversity studies of microorganisms, which withstood cleaning and bioburden reduction strategies. Both the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> isolates and the clean room strain revealed versatile physiological capacities in N-transformation processes by performing heterotrophic nitrification, respiratory ammonification and denitrification activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the investigated isolates belonged to the genus Paenibacillus. Sequence similarities lower than 97 % in comparison to established species indicated a separate species position. Except for the peptidoglycan type (A 4 alpha L-Lys–D-Asp), chemotaxonomic features of the isolates matched the genus description, but differences in several physiological characteristics separated them from related species and supported their novel species status. Despite a high 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the clean room isolate ES_MS 17 ^T and the representative <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> isolate N 3 / 975 ^T, DNA–DNA hybridization studies revealed genetic differences at the species level.

This thesis studies their seed ecology, {{focusing on}} the interaction between environmental temperature and germination. To this end we conduct laboratory germination experiments with calcareous spring fen species to characterize the temperature dimension of the germination niche and identify specific germination strategies. We explore the special thermal characteristics of <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> and their consequences on germination. Using the Cantabrian endemic Centaurium somedanum as a study species, we investigate the germination ecology of spring specialists and perform a common garden experiment supported by ISSR fingerprinting to determine the genetic and environmental influences on seed dormancy variation. Based on our results, we propose two germination strategies. Fen species generally follow a warm strategy, characterized by a heat response capable of overriding dormancy during episodes of unusual heat. Spring species lack the heat response and germinate only at cool temperatures. <b>Fen</b> <b>soils</b> have a buffer effect that makes their temperature less extreme than predicted, especially during the night and in winter. However, the germination niche breadth of fen species shows plasticity and is narrower in regions with harsher winters. The germination ecology of the spring specialist C. somedanum departs from the general germination patterns of its genus, showing morphophysiological dormancy and cool germination. This species has a local dormancy cline that {{is related to the}} genetic composition of the populations and to site climate, but that also responds in the short term to the seed maturation environment. These results highlight the potential of germination traits to react to climate changes at different spatial and temporal scales...|$|R
40|$|The diversity-stability {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} diverse communities are resilient to change. Wetlands are especially diverse and are {{an area of}} concern in the Boreal Zone of northern Alberta, Canada, as they are affected by surface mining for oil sands. This thesis describes terrestrial and semi-terrestrial invertebrate community composition within the Sandhill Fen Watershed, the first-ever landform constructed on a foundation of oil sands tailings, in the post-mining landscape. Soil attributes and plant community composition were associated with spatial variation in invertebrate abundance, richness and composition at low-elevation (peat dominated) and upland (forest soil dominated) locations within Sandhill Fen, and in 8 reference fens. Peat-dominated sites in Sandhill Fen were typically wet, saline, and slightly acidic and supported a typical herbaceous wetland plant community. The invertebrates found in this habitat were those commonly associated with wetland plant communities and were similar in composition to invertebrates in Carex-dominated (‘rich’) reference fens. The Litter-Fermentation-Humic (LFH) soil dominated upland sites were drier, less saline, had a meadow plant community, and an invertebrate assemblage that was more variable than the peat community and distinct from the fauna of reference fens. Sandhill fen invertebrate abundance was equivalent to that of reference fens. Family richness in Sandhill Fen exceeded that of reference fen sites, likely reflecting associations with the greater plant diversity of low-elevation plus upland sites combined. Sandhill <b>Fen</b> <b>soils</b> were more saline than reference <b>fen</b> <b>soils,</b> but the plant community and invertebrate community of low-elevation peat sites fell {{within the range of}} variation observed in rich reference fens. Within Sandhill Fen, plant community assemblages are consistently associated with soil attributes (moisture, salinity). Invertebrate community assemblages are directly correlated with plant assemblages and indirectly with soil attributes.

40|$|Fen peatlands are {{specific}} wetland ecosystems containing high soil organic carbon (SOC). There {{is a general}} lack of knowledge about the microbial communities that abound in these systems. We examined the microbial activity and community structure in two fen soils differing in SOC content sampled from the Ljubljana Marsh under different seasonal conditions. Substrate-induced respiration and dehydrogenase activity were used as indicators of total microbial activity. Both methods indicated higher microbial activities in the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> with the higher SOC content on all dates of sampling. To determine whether the differences in microbial activity were associated with differences in the microbial community structures, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes was performed. Comparison of the T-RFLP profiles revealed very similar community structures in both fens and in the two seasonal extremes investigated. This suggested a stable community structure in the two fens, which is not affected by the SOC content or seasonal variation. In addition, a bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene based clone library was prepared from the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> with the higher SOC content. Out of 114 clones analysed, approximately 53 % belonged to the Proteobacteria, 23 % to the Acidobacteria, 21 % to a variety of other taxa, and less than 3 % were affiliated with the Firmicutes.

40|$|The species {{composition}} of vegetation {{associated with the}} Carpathian fens primarily depends {{on the type of}} water present and the hydrological feeding of the soils that occur there. These, in turn, shape the fertility of the fens. Those with typically formed Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae fundamentally differ in the properties of their soils and feeding waters. These include differences in mineral content, pH, CaCO 3 levels, degree of peat decomposition, electrical conductivity and oxygenation of the waters that feed the fens. Carici-Agrostietum caninae is a homogenous plant association adapted to extreme habitat conditions. It is characterized by a very narrow range of essential soil and feeding water parameters. Valeriano-Caricetum flavae is a highly diverse association. Considerable diversity both in terms of plant species and vegetation structure reflects very wide ranges in the properties of soil and feeding water. Vegetation patches of transitory character were also identified. These contained plant species characteristic of both associations. The character of the vegetation depends mainly on <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> pH and the degree of mineralization of the feeding waters. It is only these parameters that allow intermediate patches to be clearly distinguished. The degree of peat decomposition, mineral content and water oxygenation all differ for Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae, whereas the values for intermediate patches display a range of parameters typical of both investigated associations.

40|$|A {{large share}} of peatlands in northwestern Germany is drained for {{agricultural}} purposes, thereby emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In order to quantify the climatic impact of <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a)  rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b)  intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c)  intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d)  arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 and fluxes of CH 4 and N 2 O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH 4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N 2 O fluxes showed a significant relation {{to the amount of}} nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2 -year mean GWP, combined from CO 2 –C eq. of NEE, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3. 8, 11. 7, 17. 7 and 17. 3  Mg CO 2 –C eq.  ha − 1  a − 1 for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2. 8, 1. 2, 1. 8, 2. 6).

The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> depended on long-term drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual on-site variability.

Net production of CH 4 was calculated from mass balances in the peat and emission using static chamber measurements and results compared to 13 C isotope budgets of CO 2 and CH 4 and energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32 ? 96 % in the wet and 86 ? 99 % in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to ? 13 C ratios of CH 4 and CO 2.

N 2 O was produced and consumed to subatmospheric concentrations in unsupplemented anoxic soil microcosms. Total cell counts and most probable numbers of denitrifiers approximated 1011 cells·gDW− 1 (where DW is dry weight) and 108 cells·gDW− 1, respectively, in both 0 - to 10 -cm and 30 - to 40 -cm depths. Despite this uniformity, depth-related maximum reaction rate (vmax) values for denitrification in anoxic microcosms ranged from 1 to 24 and − 19 to − 105 nmol N 2 O h− 1 · gDW− 1, with maximal values {{occurring in the}} upper soil layers. Denitrification was enhanced by substrates that might be formed via fermentation in anoxic microzones of soil.

40|$|Wetland soils play a {{key role}} for the {{transformation}} of heavy metals in forested watersheds, influencing their mobility, and ecotoxicity. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of release from solid to solution phase, the mobility, and the transformation of arsenic species in a <b>fen</b> <b>soil.</b> In methanol–water extracts, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and two unknown organic arsenic species were found with concentrations up to 14 ng As g− 1 at the surface horizon. Arsenate is the dominant species at the 0 – 30 cm depth, whereas arsenite predominated at the 30 – 70 cm depth. Only up to 2. 2 % of total arsenic in fen was extractable with methanol–water. In porewaters, depth gradient spatial variation of arsenic species, pH, redox potentials, and the other chemical parameters along the profile was observed in June together with high proportion of organic arsenic species (up to 1. 2 μg As L− 1, 70 % of total arsenic). Tetramethylarsonium ion and an unknown organic arsenic species were additionally detected in porewaters at deeper horizons. In comparison, the arsenic speciation in porewaters in April was homogeneous with depth and no organic arsenic species were found. Thus, the occurrence of microbial methylation of arsenic in fen was demonstrated for the first time. The 10 times elevated total arsenic concentrations in porewaters in June compared to April were accompanied by elevated concentrations of total iron, lower concentrations of sulfate and the presence of ammonium and phosphate. The low proportion of methanol–water extractable total arsenic suggests a generally low mobility of arsenic in fen soils. The release of arsenic from solid to solution phases in fen is dominantly controlled by dissolution of iron oxides, redox transformation, and methylation of arsenic, driven by microbial activity in the growing season. As a result, increased concentrations of total arsenic and potentially toxic arsenic species in fen porewaters were found in the growing season, suggesting an enhancing risk of arsenic transport of ground- and surface-waters under these conditions...|$|E

Although {{most of the}} interest has been on humans, {{during the last few}} years increasing attention has been directed to other organisms, focusing on an ecosystem perspective with the intention of defining ‘safe’ levels of radiation. Recent nuclear power plant explosions at Fukushima have also heightened public interest in low dose effects. In Norway, interest in developing the thorium resource in Telemark has also been an issue in relation to low dose radiation effects. In this study, we looked at low dose effects of gamma radiation on Arabidopsis at the Co- 60 source at Ås, analyzing parameters such as seed germination, primary root growth (1 week), seedling mortality and seedling weight. Seed germination was not affected in any of the treatments, including the highest exposure rates of 384 mGy/h. When measured 1 week after sowing seed, we found no effect of continuous gamma exposure as high as dose rates of 270 mGy/h on primary root growth or on seedling weight. Two weeks continuous exposure gave no plant mortality and no obvious growth effects except for a small increase in seedling weight at 0. 08 mGy/h (13 mGy total dose). Continuous exposure for 3 weeks resulted in significant effects on plant mortality and seedling weights, even at dose rates as low as 0. 01 mGy/h. When seedlings received a 5 or 10 day exposure of radiation followed by several days growth without exposure, we saw effects {{at the end of a}} 21 - 24 day experiment on plant mortality and seedling weights. Both low dose rates (0. 01 mGy/h for 10 days, 2. 4 mGy total dose) and very high dose rates (270 mGy/h for 5 days, 32 Gy) gave final seedling weights significantly higher than controls. We incubated plants at the Fen site in Telemark for 1 month (dose rate exposure on site of 3. 5 mGy/h), then produced seed from 1 plant at Ås.

Before applying fertilizer, variability of soil fertility was not significantly correlated with the flux of Carbon dioxide, so the difference of Carbon dioxide flux based on distance sampling can be caused by root distribution factor.   After fertilizer application, variability of Carbon dioxide flux under the oil palm tree were beside affected by differences in root distribution, was also greatly influenced by fertilization.

40|$|Plant species-rich Calthion meadows on {{mesotrophic}} <b>fen</b> pear <b>soil</b> extensively cut for hay {{are among}} the endangered semi-natural vegetation types in northwestern Europe. They are often badly affected by lowering the groundwater table (drainage) and fertilization. In a comparative study of an undrained site with a Calthion meadow and an adjacent drained site, availability of N, P and K was biologically assessed under field conditions (for two years) {{as well as in}} a greenhouse (for 18 weeks) by measuring shoot responsiveness. Also, experimental wetting of intact turf samples taken from both sites was applied in order to study the interaction between nutrient supply and anaerobic soil conditions. It was concluded that the above-ground phytomass yield in the undrained site was restricted by a major shortage of N-supply and a moderate shortage of K-supply by the <b>fen</b> peat <b>soil.</b> The above-ground phytomass yield of the drained site was only reduced by a strongly limited supply of K by the soil. The extent of K-deficiency was larger for the drained site. No P-deficiency was observed in any of the drained or undrained sites. Rewetting turf samples, taken from the drained site, did not change above-ground phytomass yields, suggesting that nutrient supplies were not affected by rewetting. Leaching has likely resulted in a strong reduction of K-supply in the drained site. It is assumed that a shortage in K-supply from the peat soil may have become an important environmental constraint for characteristic plant species of Calthion meadows. This may hamper the development of this meadow type on drained peat soils after rewetting by groundwater discharge...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{long-term}} drainage of peatland areas is helpful in future peatland management and regulations of water conditions. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} current state of <b>fen</b> peatland <b>soils</b> in the Grójecka Valley (eastern part of the Wielkopolskie voivodeship, central Poland), affected by long-term agricultural use (pastures, meadows) since the 1960 s and potentially by lignite open pit mining industry (KWB Konin) since 1980 s. Field studies were carried out in 2015 in selected <b>fen</b> peatland areas. <b>Soil</b> material for laboratory analysis was collected from genetic horizons from four soil profiles. The surface horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils were built with well-developed moorsh material. They were classified as medium moorshiefied – MtII (profile 1, 3 and 4) and strongly moorshiefied – MtIII (profile 2). Obtained results of physical and physico-chemical analysis indicate that long-term peatland utilization connected with potential impact of the lignite mining, transformed mainly the upper horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils. However, despite obvious strong human impact on peatlands ecosystems, we cannot exclude the climate variables, what should be confirmed by long-term monitoring program. Furthermore, presented paper indicated that new subtype moorsh-muddy soils (in Polish: gleby murszowo-mułowe) within the type of gleyic soils should be implemented in the next version of Polish Soil Classification...|$|R
40|$|An oak {{forest and}} three wet meadows/fens were reinvestigated after 50 years {{concerning}} tree vitality, biomass and productivity, and soil chemistry. Sulphur and nitrogen deposition {{has changed dramatically}} during these years, and {{the aim was to}} analyse the differences in both the oak forest and the open field ecosystems. Trees were re-measured and soil profiles were resampled. Important visible changes in the oak forest were stated concerning the vitality of oaks. Aboveground there was a decrease in tree biomass, production and litter fall, but a huge increase in standing dead logs. During the years, the deposition of sulphur had decreased drastically, but nitrogen deposition was still high. Soil acidification in the forest had decreased, reflected in an increased base saturation in the forest, in spite of slightly lowered pH-values. Strongly increased amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg now appeared in the forest soil, and a substantial transport of calcium and magnesium had obviously taken place from the forest soil to the meadow and fens during the years. However, the most important soil change was the accumulation of organic matter. The increased accumulation of organic matter in turn meant increased amounts of colloid particles and microsites for ion exchange in the soil. This favoured 2 -valence base cations, and especially Ca and Mg that increased very much in all the studied ecosystems. Carbon as well as nitrogen had strongly increased in the forest, meadow and <b>fen</b> <b>soils.</b> This was interpreted as a natural result of increased vegetation growth due to high nitrogen deposition, increased global annual temperature and increased carbon dioxide concentration in air. It was concluded that the decreased deposition of sulphur had had a positive effect on soil chemistry, and that the deposition of nitrogen probably had stimulated vegetation growth in general, and contributed to increased amount of organic matter in the soils. However, in this studied oak forest, the decreased vitality and many killed trees were also suspected to be a result of high nitrogen deposition. Obviously increased tree growth was counteracted by decreased stress resistance, and increased appearance of pathogens in the oak trees...|$|R

40|$|Report to U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 1, Portland, OregonSphagnum fens on {{the coast}} of Oregon are unique {{globally}} and contain a variety of rare plants and animals found nowhere else in the landscape. Evidence indicates that in the absence of disturbance, many open fens have converted to tall shrub and forest stands over the last 25 - 50 years, while fens on lake-fill mats show slower rates of change. Ditching in fens with deep peat appears to have hastened succession, while perched-water <b>fens</b> on <b>soils</b> underlain by hardpan exhibit the greatest rate of change because of lack of disturbance.

40|$|Intensive {{cultivation}} of <b>fen</b> peat <b>soils</b> (Eutric Histosols) for agricultural purposes, started in Europe about 250 years ago, resulting in decreased soil fertility, increased oxidation of peat and corresponding CO 2 -emissions to the atmosphere, nutrient transfer to aquatic ecosystems and {{losses in the}} total area of the former native wetlands. To prevent these negative environmental effects set-aside programs and rewetting measures were promoted in recent years. Literature results and practical experiences showed that large scale rewetting of intensively used agricultural Histosols may result in the mobilisation of phosphorus (P), its transport to adjacent surface waters and an accelerated eutrophication risk. The paper summarises results from an international European Community sponsored research project and demonstrates how results obtained at different scales and from different scientific disciplines were compiled to derive a strategy to carry out rewetting measures. A decision support system (DSS) for a hydrologically sensitive area in the Droemling catchment in north-eastern Germany was developed and {{is presented as a}} tool to regulate rewetting in order to control P release. It is demonstrated that additional laboratory experiments to identify essential processes of P release during rewetting and the site-specific management of the water table, the involvement of specific knowledge and experience of the stakeholders are necessary to develop an applicable DSS.

40|$|Environmental {{stress is}} {{the main cause of}} the decline of species {{diversity}} in low-productive fen meadows in the Netherlands. Attempts to restore species diverse fen meadows e. g. by sod cutting frequently fail. We supposed that unsuccessful efforts are due to ignoring the impact of environmental stress on the performance of soil biota, which {{play a key role in}} N-immobilization and keeping available-N for primary production low. We investigated both pristine and degraded natural sites and successfully and unsuccessfully restored sites of poor and rich fen meadows. We determined plant species composition, soil chemical properties, N-pools in soil biota, N-mineralization rates, and N-fluxes. In pristine rich and poor fen meadows, mineral-N was poorly available for primary production due to a strong N-immobilization by soil biota. Annual N-immobilization fluxes exceeded by far the annual N-harvest by primary production. N-immobilization in pristine fens was higher than in degraded fens. In successfully restored rich fens, net N-mineralization was lower and N-immobilization higher than in the unsuccessful category. From our results, we derived the hypothesis that in degraded or in unsuccessfully restored <b>fens</b> the <b>soils</b> internal N-balance shifted from N-immobilization to net N-mineralization, favoring biomass production but disadvantaging plant species diversity. N-retention driven by an active N-immobilizing soil biological community, is likely a decisive process for successful recovery of plant species diversity in low productive fen meadows. We recommend that restoration techniques should stimulate a functionally diverse soil fauna, as this may enhance the storage of available nutrients in the soil food web...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating {{environmental}} conditions can promote diversity and control dominance in community composition. In addition to seasonal temperature and moisture changes, seasonal supply of metabolic substrates selects populations temporally. Here we demonstrate cascading {{effects in the}} supply of metabolic substrates on methanogenesis and community composition of anaerobic methanogenic archaea in three contrasting peatlands in upstate New York. Fresh samples of peat soils, collected about every 3 [*]months for 20 [*]months and incubated at 22 [*]±[*] 2 °C regardless of the in situ temperature, exhibited potential rates of methane (CH 4) production of 0. 02 – 0. 2 [*]mmol[*]L− 1 [*]day− 1 [380 – 3800 [*]nmol[*]g− 1 [*](dry) [*]day− 1). The addition of acetate stimulated rates of CH 4 production in a <b>fen</b> peatland <b>soil,</b> whereas addition of hydrogen (H 2), and simultaneous inhibition of H 2 -consuming acetogenic bacteria with rifampicin, stimulated CH 4 production in two acidic bog soils, especially, in autumn and winter. The methanogenic community structure was characterized using T-RFLP analyses of SSU rRNA genes. The E 2 group of methanogens (Methanoregulaceae) dominated in the two acidic bog peatlands with relatively greater abundance in winter. In the fen peatland, the E 1 group (Methanoregulaceae) {{and members of the}} Methanosaetaceae were co-dominant, with E 1 having a high relative abundance in spring. Change in relative abundance profiles among methanogenic groups in response to added metabolic substrates was as predicted. The acetate-amendment increased abundance of Methanosarcinaceae, and H 2 -amendment enhanced abundance of E 2 group in all peat soils studied, respectively. Additionally, addition of acetate increased abundance of Methanosaetaceae only in the bog soils. Variation in the supply of metabolic substrates helps explain the moderate diversity of methanogens in peatlands...|$|R
