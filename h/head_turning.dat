25|$|The Bengals {{took over}} {{the game in the}} second half, forcing Buffalo to start all of their drives from inside their own 23-yard line as they held the ball for only 9:04, totaling 53 yards, two first downs, and no points. On their first three drives of the second half, the Bills totaled −12 yards. Midway through the third quarter, Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson pinned the Bills at their own 1-yard line with a 58-yard kick. Buffalo then went three-and-out, and Bengals {{receiver}} Ira Hillary returned John Kidd's 50-yard punt 15 yards to the Bills 40. Three plays into their ensuing drive, Cincinnati faced fourth down and 4. Wilson ran six yards for a first down on a fake punt, enabling the Bengals to keep driving for a clutch score. Later in the drive, Bills defensive back Derrick Burroughs was ejected from the game for striking receiver Tim McGee in the <b>head,</b> <b>turning</b> what would have been a third and goal from the 8 into a first and goal from the 4-yard line, and Cincinnati ended up scoring with Woods' 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter, increasing their lead to 21–10. The Bills later managed a drive to the Bengals 18-yard line, but safety David Fulcher picked off a desperate fourth down pass from Kelly in the end zone.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural lateralisation {{is evident}} across most animal taxa, {{although}} few marsupial and no fossorial {{species have been}} studied. Twelve wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) were bilaterally presented with eight sounds from different contexts (threat, neutral, food) to test for auditory laterality. <b>Head</b> <b>turns</b> were recorded prior to and immediately following sound presentation. Behaviour was recorded for 150 seconds after presentation. Although sound differentiation was evident {{by the amount of}} exploration, vigilance and grooming performed after different sound types, this did not result in different patterns of <b>head</b> <b>turn</b> direction. Similarly, left-right proportions of <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> walking events and food approaches in the post-sound period were comparable across sound types. A comparison of <b>head</b> <b>turns</b> performed before and after sound showed a significant change in turn direction (χ 2 1 = 10. 65, P = 0. 001) from a left preference during the pre-sound period (mean 58 % left <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> CI 49 - 66 %) to a right preference in the post-sound (mean 43 % left <b>head</b> <b>turns,</b> CI 40 - 45 %). This provides evidence of a right auditory bias in response to the presentation of the sound. This study therefore demonstrates that laterality is evident in southern hairy-nosed wombats in response to a sound stimulus, although side biases were not altered by sounds of varying context...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen {{asked to}} look through a tube, young {{children}} (normal, strabismic, monocularly enucleated) place it between the eyes, while older children <b>turn</b> the <b>head</b> or shut one eye. We videotaped 174 children (normals and strabismics, 2 – 17 yr of age) and 16 normal adults {{to find out when}} and why <b>head</b> <b>turn</b> occurs. In learning to look with one eye, children progressed through a sequence of four responses, categorized by age or amount of <b>head</b> <b>turn.</b> Binocular children use <b>head</b> <b>turn</b> apparently to avoid diplopia, then, most learn to shut one eye.

60|$|I {{have said}} that against the wall--on the {{right-hand}} side of the doorway (the right-hand side as we looked at it, but the left as one entered)--there stood a large mummy-case. To our unutterable amazement it was slowly opening. Gradually, gradually the lid was swinging back, and the black slit which marked the opening was becoming wider and wider. So gently and carefully was it done that the movement was almost imperceptible. Then, as we breathlessly watched it, a white thin hand appeared at the opening, pushing back the painted lid, then another hand, and finally a face--a face which was familiar to us both, that of Professor Andreas. Stealthily he slunk out of the mummy-case, like a fox stealing from its burrow, his <b>head</b> <b>turning</b> incessantly to left and to right, stepping, then pausing, then stepping again, the very image of craft and of caution. Once some sound in the street struck him motionless, and he stood listening, with his ear turned, ready to dart back to the shelter behind him. Then he crept onwards again upon tiptoe, very, very softly and slowly, until he had reached the case in the centre of the room. There he took a bunch of keys from his pocket, unlocked the case, took out the Jewish breastplate, and, laying it upon the glass in front of him, began to work upon it with some sort of small, glistening tool. He was so directly underneath us that his bent head covered his work, but we could guess from the movement of his hand that he was engaged in finishing the strange disfigurement which he had begun.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and {{describe}} the Conditioned <b>Head</b> <b>Turn</b> procedure, with primary focus on its use as a method for testing infant speech perception. The paper begins with a brief history of the Conditioned <b>Head</b> <b>Turn</b> Procedure followed by a fairly detailed description of how the procedure is currently implemented. We then briefly outline the methods of analysis that are best suited for data obtained with the Conditioned <b>Head</b> <b>Turn</b> procedure. Next discussed are variations in the Conditioned <b>Head</b> <b>Turn</b> procedure when it is used with subjects of different ages. Then, some of the kinds of findings that have been revealed in the area of infant speech perception are presented to give the reader a sense of the range of questions that can be answered using this procedure. Following this, the strengths and limitations of the procedure are discussed frankly. We end with a presentation of new variations to the procedure that have been developed in recent years, and note how these new variations are expanding the range of questions th...|$|R
