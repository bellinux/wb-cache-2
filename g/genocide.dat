The Armenian National Institute lists 30 Armenian <b>Genocide</b> memorials in the US. The oldest one is Montebello <b>Genocide</b> Memorial, which was completed in 1965. Khachkars across America were erected in honor of the 1.5 million victims of the <b>Genocide.</b> Recently, the Armenian Heritage Park was opened in Boston, MA.|$|E

5|$|The {{event has}} been {{described}} by historians as a decapitation strike, which was intended to deprive the Armenian population of leadership and a chance for resistance. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian <b>Genocide,</b> 24 April is observed as Armenian <b>Genocide</b> Remembrance Day. First observed in 1919 on the four-year anniversary of the events in Constantinople, the date is generally considered the date on which the <b>genocide</b> began. The Armenian <b>Genocide</b> has since been commemorated annually on the same day, which has become a national holiday in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and is observed by the Armenian diaspora around the world.|$|E

40|$|By {{exploring}} how the Assyrian and Romani <b>genocides</b> came to {{be forgotten}} in official history and collective memory, this paper takes a step towards redress for years of inadvertent neglect and deliberate concealment. In addressing the roles played by scholars and nations, {{and the effect of}} international law and government policy, it notes the inaccessibility of evidence, combined with a narrow application of definitions of victim groups, and a focus on written proof of perpetrator intent. Continuing persecution of survivors {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>genocides,</b> and government actions to erase the <b>genocides</b> from history, are common to both cases. The dimension of a comparative analysis between two emblematic “hidden” <b>genocides</b> shows that there are many similarities in the process of forgetting that occurred in their respective aftermaths. Developing an understanding of how these <b>genocides</b> {{came to be}} ignored and forgotten may provide a foundation for genuine acknowledgment and redress...|$|R
5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural <b>genocide.</b> The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological <b>genocide</b> also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological <b>genocide</b> occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological <b>genocide</b> against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
