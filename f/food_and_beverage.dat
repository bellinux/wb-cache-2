40|$|Background: Although {{traditional}} fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> play {{an important}} role in contributing to the livelihoods of Namibians through enhanced <b>food</b> security <b>and</b> income generation, there is a scarcity of information regarding their traditional production methods, microbiological and biochemical characteristics, nutritional value, and safety. Research into the processing technologies of these <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> is still in its infancy; thus, there is a need to document their traditional production methods, microbiology, and biochemistry in order to evaluate their nutritional value and safety, standardize and industrialize them, where possible, and preserve them for future generations. Methods: The socioeconomic importance, traditional production methods and, where available, microbiological, biochemical, and nutritional properties and safety evaluation of commonly consumed fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> in Namibia are documented. Recommendations are made for potential research areas. Results: Commonly produced fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> in Namibia include milk-based products (omashikwa, mashini ghakushika, mabisi, <b>and</b> âudaï), cereal-based <b>beverages</b> (oshikundu, omalodu, otombo, epwaka, okatokele, oshafuluka, maxau, and /Ho ≠Goas), vegetable-based fermented <b>food,</b> mudhika, <b>and</b> fruit-based <b>beverages</b> (ombike, omagongo, <b>and</b> omalunga). Conclusion: Fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> play a major role in the diet, socioeconomic, and cultural activities of the Namibian population. Most are spontaneously fermented. Research is scarce and should be conducted on the microbiology, biochemistry, nutritional value, and safety of the fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> to ensure the health of the population...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the degree of}} market power of the Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry over the period 1983 – 2007 at the three-digit SIC level. The present study also estimates the “deadweight” loss and the reduction of consumers’ income due to the possible existence of market power in the Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry. Based on Bresnahan’s (1989) conjectural variation model, three different approaches are used to investigate competitive conditions of the Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry. The first approach assesses the extent of market power of the whole industry over the period 1983 – 2007; the second approach tests the degree of market power in {{each one of the}} nine sectors of the industry over the whole period, i. e. 1983 – 2007; and the third one estimates the extent of market power for the whole Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry for specific sub-periods of the period 1983 – 2007. The methodology of Dickson and Yu (1989) is adopted to measure the welfare losses. The empirical results indicate the presence of some degree of market power in the whole Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry as well as in each one sector of the industry during the period 1983 – 2007 and, as a result, the existence of welfare losses. In addition, the empirical findings support the presence of some degree of market power for each sub-period of the period 1983 – 2007 in the whole Greek <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry <b>and</b> the existence of welfare losses.
