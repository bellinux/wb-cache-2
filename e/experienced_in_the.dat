5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss, Rona and Marietta Blau {{left the}} Radium Institute {{because of their}} Jewish {{heritage}} and the antisemitic persecution they <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory. Rona first returned to Budapest and worked in an industrial laboratory, but within a few months, the position was eliminated. She worked from October to December 1938 in Sweden, and then accepted a temporary position for one year at the University of Oslo, which had been offered by Gleditsch. Reluctant to leave her home, {{at the end of}} her year in Oslo, Rona returned to Hungary. She was appointed to a position at the Radium-Cancer Hospital in Budapest, preparing radium for medicinal purposes.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. The book was translated into five languages. She {{took part in the}} Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.|$|E

Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43.

According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe.

5|$|The 25-pounder {{was well}} suited to the open {{conditions}} the Army <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean and Middle East theatres but proved difficult to deploy in jungle terrain. While the developed road network in Malaya allowed it to be moved by vehicles during the Malayan Campaign, the rugged terrain and limited transport infrastructure in New Guinea meant that the guns could only be moved away from coastal plains and airfields by manhandling. As a result, Australian infantry often had no artillery support heavier than 3 inch mortars during the New Guinea Campaign in 1942.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|The seventh Baron {{attempted}} {{to retain the}} house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground {{was built in the}} nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden and some of the contents to the National Trust, a charitable body <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of historic properties. The National Trust further purchased at a cost of £8 million (worth about £ today) 1,317acres (5.3km²) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.|$|E
5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E

Robin Herd, co-owner of the March Racing Team, took control of the club in 1995. In June of that year, the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16,000-seat stadium at Minchery Farm, to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998–99 season, but construction was suspended during the preceding season, because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not been paid for the work already undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Azores.

5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained full operational capability with the Super Hornet in December 2012.|$|E
