5|$|The Divas match set for Vengeance {{was between}} Victoria and Christy Hemme. On the May 30 edition of Raw, Christy Hemme won a bikini contest; {{defeating}} Victoria, Candice Michelle, Maria, and Lilian Garcia. After the contest ended, Victoria {{turned into a}} villainess by attacking all of the participants, saving Hemme for last. In a backstage interview following her heel turn, the evil Victoria expressed jealousy of Hemme, stating that {{she was tired of}} Hemme getting all of the attention. On the June 20 episode of Raw, it was announced in a backstage interview that Hemme and Victoria would face each other at Vengeance. Hemme stated that she couldn't wait to get her hands on Victoria, but during the segment, Victoria interrupted the interview by smashing a <b>glass</b> <b>jar</b> on the back of Hemme's head.|$|E

25|$|The gravity cell {{consisted}} of a <b>glass</b> <b>jar,</b> in which a copper cathode sat {{on the bottom and}} a zinc anode was suspended beneath the rim. Copper sulfate crystals would be scattered around the cathode and then the jar would be filled with distilled water. As the current was drawn, a layer of zinc sulfate solution would form at the top around the anode. This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.|$|E

The EPA and the Maine DEP recommend a sealed <b>glass</b> <b>jar</b> as the best repository for a broken bulb.|$|E

The mother sends Chanie on his way with dried moose meat and tells him to turn right at the tracks to head back to the school. The girl gives him a <b>glass</b> <b>jar</b> that holds seven matches. Chanie leaves the cabin, resolved to find his two friends and their uncle. However, when he reunites with them, the uncle tells him he cannot stay and that he must return to the school.

25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space and put them in a <b>glass</b> <b>jar.</b> The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E

Cans are cheaper and quicker to make, and much less fragile than <b>glass</b> <b>jars.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>jars</b> have remained popular for some high-value products and in home canning. Can openers were not invented for another thirty years — at first, soldiers had to cut the cans open with bayonets or smash them open with rocks.

25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top <b>glass</b> <b>jar</b> wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E
500|$|The video {{channels}} [...] "Nano of the North", {{an episode}} {{from the fourth}} season of The Powerpuff Girls, in which each Sugababes member portrays a Powerpuff Girl. The video opens with a clip of Professor Utonium driving in his car. Meanwhile, a dark cloud hovers over Townsville and it soon begins to rain and dissolves the town. When Professor Utonium arrives home, The Powerpuff Girls are shown watching the Sugababes on television, although the clip is interrupted with a News Flash that reads [...] "Robot Rain Terrorises Townsville". Professor Utonium manages to retrieve the Sugababes and infuses them with Chemical X. He shrinks them to a microscopic size, places them in a <b>glass</b> <b>jar</b> and drives off {{in the car with}} them. He exits the car but trips over, causing the jar to drop and break. The Sugababes, playing the roles of The Powerpuff Girls, fight off the Nanobots with their superpowers. However, a gigantic Nanobot soon appears, and subsequently defeats the Sugababes through superior strength. Professor Utonium witnesses the incident and crushes the Nanobot with his foot. The rain subsequently stops and the sun appears, in which the people of the town start to celebrate. When the Sugababes were questioned about their reaction to the video and its animation, group member Keisha Buchanan responded: [...] "It was so funny seeing us like that and the Powerpuff Girls cartoon itself. The video so much resembled our personalities with these three characters so it was very funny to watch actually." ...|$|E
