25|$|Christie {{has been}} purposefully vague about Poirot's origins, {{as he is}} thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In An Autobiography, she {{admitted}} that she already <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> to be an old man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.|$|E
500|$|Upon Alston's death, MLB {{commissioner}} Peter Ueberroth {{referred to}} {{him as one of}} baseball's greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on {{how easy it was to}} play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E

50|$|General Robert E. Lee - General Lee {{is portrayed}} as stately, and, as essayist Gallager said, knightly and religiously. In fact, Kantor speaks very highly of Lee {{in a number of}} passages, for example: “You could <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> Lee in the wars of long ago, in {{polished}} armor. You could <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> in the wars of Biblical times, proud of his chariot, fascinating the Philistines”.|$|R
500|$|After the Battle of Berlin {{ended in}} early May 1945, Limanskaya was {{assigned}} to direct traffic at the Brandenburg Gate during the Potsdam Conference in late July. While conducting her duties, she was photographed, filmed, and also interviewed by Eugeny Haldey, a journalist employed by Tyelyegrafnoye Agyentstvo Sovyetskogo Soyuza ("Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union"; TASS), a state news agency. Her picture was widely published in newspapers and magazines worldwide and she quickly became an iconic image of the victory over Nazi Germany. She furthermore had a brief conversation with the British leader Winston Churchill as his entourage was passing by the gate {{on their way to}} Potsdam. Limanskaya later said about her meeting Churchill, [...] " [...] looked precisely the way I <b>imagined</b> <b>him,</b> puffing on a cigar".|$|E
500|$|In the book, Rowling {{introduces}} {{an eclectic}} cast of characters. The first character {{to be introduced}} is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard", and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, [...] "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character with [...] "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees {{appear as}} characters, often eponymously, in {{children}}'s books. The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{is an old}} name for bumblebee. J. K. Rowling said the name [...] "seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> walking around humming to himself". Among the many books for younger children are Bumble the Bee by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal (2014); Bertie Bumble Bee by K. I. Al-Ghani (2012); Ben the Bumble Bee: How do bees make honey? by Romessa Awadalla (2015); Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt by Papa Campbell (2012); Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! Went Bumble-bee by Colin West (1997); Bumble Bee by Margaret Wise Brown (2000); How the Bumble Came to Bee by Paul and Ella Quarry (2012); The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees by Stephen Brailovsky (2010). Among Beatrix Potter's [...] "little books", Babbity Bumble {{and other members of}} her nest appear in The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse (1910).|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} group checks into a motel, Kit tells the girls that {{she heard a}} rumor about Ben, commenting that he had {{recently}} been released from jail, after killing someone. The girls then {{spend most of the}} journey feeling uneasy around him, until they confront him. Ben reveals that he was in jail for driving his step-sister across state borders without parental consent, after his father was abusing her. Having established that Ben was not the assassin they <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> to be, Lucy and Ben grow closer. The girls talk properly to each other {{for the first time since}} they were kids. Lucy reveals that her mother left her and her father when she was a child, but she is convinced her mother wants to find her, but is too afraid. Kit, who was overweight as a child, has an overbearing mother who sent her to [...] "fat camp" [...] but now cannot stand that her daughter is more beautiful than her. Mimi reveals that the baby's father was not her boyfriend, but a guy who raped her after she got drunk at a party.|$|E
500|$|The game {{combines}} several Aztec {{beliefs of}} the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer's decade-long fascination with folklore, stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley, and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes, with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would {{set the stage for}} an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: [...] "Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You'd want to be the grim reaper himself. That's how Manny got his job. Then I <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> picking up people {{in the land of the}} living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he's really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he's just punching the clock." [...] Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife, one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin, such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest, they would still have the hidden bag of gold; this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crime-ridden, film noir style to the world, triggered too many ideas that they had to then trim down. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game's overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several non-linear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling stated {{she chose}} the name Dumbledore, {{which is an}} Early Modern English [...] word for [...] "bumblebee", because of Dumbledore's love of music: she <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> walking around [...] "humming to himself a lot".|$|E

60|$|Mr. Chris Holtzmann {{was very}} much {{the style of a}} man I had <b>imagined</b> <b>him</b> to be. He was short and stout, with a thick neck and a double chin. He was loudly dressed, {{including}} several seal rings and a heavy gold watch chain.|$|E
