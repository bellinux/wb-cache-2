5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E

Goaltenders Joe Kennedy and up and coming athletic goaltender Jason Taylor were moved as well along with Rob Szatsmary forward and Ryan Beamin a solid defensemen.

The Centennials missed the playoffs while Kelowna Spartans would {{go all the way to}} the Centennial Cup championship, only to lose to the Olds Grizzlys.

25|$|Onerva enjoyed her studies, teachers, {{and peers}} and {{performed}} {{well at the}} girls' school. After the girls' school, she continued into secondary school (jatko-opisto), where she engaged in various extracurricular activities. Onerva was talented: she sung, wrote, painted, and recital. In continuing her studies, she studied French and acquired a preliminary teacher's degree in 1902. After two years of secondary education, Onerva began to prepare for her matriculation examination as a private student of Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu since her secondary institution did not offer the possibility to take the examination.

25|$|Van Asseldonk {{graduated}} into single-seaters at {{the start}} of the 2010 season, moving into Formula BMW. He made his début at the level in the Pacific series with Motaworld Racing, taking part in the season-opening round at Sepang as a guest driver. This was a precursor to his main campaign in the pan-European championship later in the year, competing for the Josef Kaufmann Racing team alongside Robin Frijns and Petri Suvanto. Van Asseldonk <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> first half of the season, taking only one top-five finish in four meetings; a fifth-place finish at Zandvoort during the Masters of Formula 3-support event. The first of two late-season podiums came at Hockenheim for van Asseldonk, as he finished in third place behind Frijns and Jack Harvey; the first time that two Dutch drivers had featured on the podium, while it was van Asseldonk's first victory in the Rookie Cup for first-season drivers. He took another third place at the final meeting of the year – and, ultimately the series – at Monza, with Frijns winning the race again ahead of Côme Ledogar. He ultimately finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship, and second to Carlos Sainz Jr. in the Rookie Cup.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} fight {{scenes in the}} film. For realism, the actors fought without rehearsing. Although the first scene {{utilised}} music and other technical enhancements, Pothan wanted the climactic fight to look more natural: [...] "I felt {{it would be better}} to film it without its cinematic nature. To be able to relate to the scene, it had to look natural. Fahadh and Sujith <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time while shooting". The scene was filmed in four days on muddy grounds near the Cheruthoni and Idukki Dams. The film's appooppan thadi (milkweeds) were artificial; about 1,000 were made from lightweight materials. In a scene where Crispin cuts them down, most blew upward like real milkweeds and the scene had to be re-shot several times. The film was made on a budget of 4.50 crore.|$|E
500|$|At {{comprehensive}} school, Turunen {{performed as}} a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, [...] "Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was." [...] Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, [...] "If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times". At school she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert {{in front of a}} thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gulf News, Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, [...] "I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E
