6000|$|The {{correlation}} {{of a white}} colour and blue eyes in male cats with deafness, and of the tortoise-shell marking with the female sex of the same animal, are two well-known but most extraordinary cases. Equally remarkable is the fact, communicated to Darwin by Mr. Tegetmeier, that white, yellow, pale blue, or dun pigeons, of all breeds, have the young birds born naked, while in all other colours they are well covered with down. Here we have {{a case in which}} colour seems of more physiological importance than all the varied structural differences between the varieties and breeds of pigeons. In Virginia there is a plant called the paint-root (Lachnanthes tinctoria), which, when eaten by pigs, colours their bones pink, and causes the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; so that black pigs only can be kept in the district.[58] Buckwheat in flower is also said to be injurious to white pigs but not to black. In the Tarentino, black sheep are not injured by eating the Hypericum crispum--a species of St. John's-wort--which kills white sheep. White terriers suffer most from distemper; white chickens from the gapes. White-haired horses or cattle are subject to cutaneous diseases from which the dark coloured are free; while, both in Thuringia and the West Indies, it has been noticed that white or pale coloured cattle are much more troubled by flies than are those which are brown or black. The same law even extends to insects, for it is found that silkworms which produce white cocoons resist the <b>fungus</b> <b>disease</b> much better than do those which produce yellow cocoons.[59] Among plants, we have in North America green and yellow-fruited plums not affected by a disease that attacked the purple-fruited varieties. Yellow-fleshed peaches suffer more from disease than white-fleshed kinds. In Mauritius, white sugar-canes were attacked by a disease from which the red canes were free. White onions and verbenas are most liable to mildew; and red-flowered hyacinths were more injured by the cold during a severe winter in Holland than any other kinds.[60] ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the Chrysosporium anamorph of Nannizziopsis vriesii (CANV) causes {{dermatitis}} and cellulitis in reptiles for example; CANV was isolated from the skin of chameleons, geckos and more recently coastal bearded dragons which had nodular lesions and crusty debris on the skin. Skin lesions have also been associated with poor nutrition which make reptiles more prone to infections as a whole. Once the skin becomes infected, there is an increased risk of developing a fatal condition called yellow <b>fungus</b> <b>disease.</b> Unlike other fungi which infect reptiles, infections with N. vreisii are contagious and often fatal if not properly treated. A recent review described a series of cases of infections which are resistant treatment, however certain agents may have some limited effectiveness, including: triamcinolone acetonide, neomycin, thiostrepton, nystatin. Usually infections are successfully treated with thiabendazole or ketoconazole, however, other suggested treatment options might include the removal of infected skin regions followed by the use of itaconazole as a maintenance drug. A related fungus, Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is responsible for an important disease of snakes.|$|E
5000|$|However, the {{discovery}} in 1802 {{of the native}} Catawba grape led to very successful wine-making in Ohio. By 1842 Nicholas Longworth was growing 1200 acres of Catawba grapes and making the country's first Sparkling wine. In 1858, The Illustrated London News described Catawba as [...] "a finer wine of the hock species and flavor than any hock {{that comes from the}} Rhine" [...] and wrote that sparkling Catawba [...] "transcends the Champagne of France." [...] But the successful operations in Ohio ceased when <b>fungus</b> <b>disease</b> destroyed the vineyards. Some growers responded by moving north to the shores of Lake Erie and its islands, where mildew was not a problem. The Finger Lakes region of New York State developed a successful wine-making industry beginning in the early 1860s when the Pleasant Valley Wine Company began using carefully selected derivatives of native grapes to produce wine. In 1865 the Urbana Wine Company (which marketed its wine under the Gold Seal label) was established. In 1872, O-Neh-Da Vineyard was established by the late Bishop Bernard McQuaid, on the shores of Hemlock Lake, to make pure grape wine for his churches. 1880 saw the establishment of the Taylor Wine Company. By the late 19th century, wines from the Finger Lakes were winning prizes at wine tastings in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of <b>fungus</b> <b>disease</b> are often found underground. The H. annosum infections cause an {{abnormal}} change in structure in the roots that climbs up to {{the butt of the}} tree. More than half the tree may be killed before any symptoms appear to the human eye. Basidiocarps can take up to one and a half or even three years to be visible. This infections causes the trees to have abnormal needle growth, pale yellow barks, and the trees to wither and die. This root disease typically causes the tree to have a thin crown from bottom up and inside out. Trees will eventually die. A landscape scale symptom is the rings of dead trees in various stages of decay and death, with the oldest at the center and progressively younger moving outward. The white rot fungus found in the roots is the sign of telling whether the tree has been affected by H. annosum. The bark changes colors as the stages progress, they go from pale yellow, to a crusty light brown, and finally in its advanced stage it turns white with the signature of Fomes annosus ― a sprinkled streak of black spots. Another sign is the leaking part of the root that causes a compact mass to form between it and the sand.|$|E
