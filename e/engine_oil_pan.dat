40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{automotive parts}} located underneath {{the engine and}} in particular the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pan.</b> Classically made of stamped steel or cast aluminum, new developments have allowed the manufacture oil pans with polyamide 66 reinforced by 35 % weight of short glass fiber. However, polyamides have some limitations and the most significant is their response to localized impact loading. The nature of the impact considered here is of a typical stone collected from the road and projected into the oil pan. Low velocity impact investigations were carried out using a gas gun and drop weight tower. The study shows that the design of the oil pan has a significant contribution in the shock absorption. In addition to the material properties, the geometry and the ribbing both cleverly combined, increase the impact resistance of the component significantly. Areas of oil pan design improvement have been identified and conclusions drawn...|$|E

In-process friction force and temperature changes are observed and specific wear on the tested surface and dilution effects on viscosity are measured.

40|$|This paper investigates low {{velocity}} impact {{involving a}} glass fiber-reinforced polyamide <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> {{as part of}} a complete new development of thermoplastic components. The assessment of the impact resistance has driven the need to employ LS DYNA for finite element modeling in order to benchmark and predict the strength and fracture behavior of stressed plastic parts. In order to develop a reliable predictive capability and to validate simulations, complete components were manufactured by injection molding techniques for the experimental samples. Low velocity impact investigations were carried out using a gas gun and a falling weight tester in order to simulate impact events to which the oil pan is subjected whilst in operational service. This was intended to point out damage tolerance and failure mechanisms likely to occur in the structure. The study results show the significant contribution of the design in terms of shock absorption. Specific oil pan design with protective ribbing combined with a superior material considerably improves the impact resistance.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a {{simultaneous}} design and development {{work for a}} diesel <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> is presented. The interesting point making {{the design of the}} oil pan so special is its laminated steel material. Beside its material, due to the deep-drawing production method, to determine the natural frequencies of the structure with Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) methodology is a problem for the design engineer. Especially when the highly nonlinear character of the oil pan and regions at different thicknesses sum up with the hardness of liquid modelling, free vibration modal analysis of the design at virtual environment becomes extremely challenging. Therefore, instead of refining the material characteristics in virtual design, first a primary 3 D dummy design is generated. Afterwards, a production method and material intent sample is produced with soft tool. Hammer test is applied on this sample filled with oil, therefore modal shapes and frequencies are gained. As a result, CAE modal analysis is generated and correlated by hammer test results; hence the first challenge of modelling the liquid is overcome. Then, critical stress locations are determined with the CAE durability analysis. After instrumenting the pan with optimum number of accelerometers and strain-gages from these critical locations, a durability test on a fired engine is run. With the measurements here, the CAE durability analysis is refined so the second challenge of material nonlinearity an...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} years an {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} paid to vibration and noise control in automotive engineering. The control of noise and vibration is essential in the design process of an automobile, since it contributes to the comfort, efficiency and safety. Considering trucks, the power train represents one of the main noise sources. The major contributor to the power train noise emission is the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pan.</b> The purpose of this project is to design a truck oil pan for vibration reduction using numerical simulations. In the analyses Finite Element Method (FEM) is applied to model the structural behavior of the oil pan. There are static load and dynamic load acting on a vehicle structure simultaneously. The current work explores the effects of pre-stress forces on modal parameters of oil pan. The harmonic response analysis of pre-stressed oil pan is one of the key objectives in this project. The harmonic response analysis of pre-stressed oil pan using ANSYS has been explored. FE simulations of the oil pan are presented, which are aimed to indentify the most dominant mode shapes within a frequency range of 0 - 1200 Hz. First pre-stress modal analysis is performed using block lanczo's method on the oil pan and then harmonic analysis of the pre-stressed oil pan is completed using full harmonic method. Based on the results obtained, efforts are made to optimize the design of oil pan to reduce the resonance effect caused due to vibrations. NX-CAD software is used to design the oil pan...|$|E
40|$|In modern engine design, {{downsizing}} {{and reducing}} weight while still providing an increased {{amount of power}} has been a general trend in recent decades. Traditionally, an engine design with superior NVH performance usually comes with a heavier, thus sturdier structure. Therefore, modern engine design requires that NVH {{be considered in the}} very early design stage to avoid modifications of engine structure at the last minute, when very few changes can be made. NVH design optimization of engine components has become more practical due to the development of computer software and hardware. However, there is still a need for smarter algorithms to draw a direct relationship between the design and the radiated sound power. At the moment, techniques based on modal acoustic transfer vectors (MATVs) have gained popularity in design optimization for their good performance in sound pressure prediction. Since MATVs are derived based on structural modes, they are not independent with respect to radiated sound power. In contrast, acoustic radiation modes are an orthogonal set of velocity distributions on the structure’s surface that contribute to the radiated sound power independently. As a result, it is beneficial to describe structural vibration in terms of acoustic radiation modes in order to identify the velocity distributions that contribute the majority of the radiated sound power. Measures can then be taken to modify the identified vibration patterns to reduce their magnitudes, which will in turn result in an unequivocal reduction of the radiated sound power. A workflow based on multibody dynamic simulation and acoustic radiation modes to optimize an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> design is demonstrated in this paper. Introductio...|$|E

40|$|Cold start driving cycles exhibit an {{increase}} in friction losses due to the low temperatures of metal and media compared to normal operating engine conditions. These friction losses are responsible for up to 10 % penalty in fuel economy over the official drive cycles like the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), where {{the temperature of the}} oil even {{at the end of the}} 1180 s of the drive cycle is below the fully warmed up values of between 100 °C and 120 °C.

Therefore <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> temperatures above 100 °C are desirable to minimize engine wear through blow by condensate.

It is shown how a very simple sensitivity analysis can be used to assess the relative size or efficiency of different heat transfer passes and the resulting fuel economy improvement potential of different heat recovery systems system.
