Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> the window and there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had to look out the porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Reuters, some {{neighbors and}} {{relatives}} of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m., enter homes and open fire. [...] "They were all drunk and shooting all over the place," [...] said neighbor Agha Lala. [...] According to The New York Times, one of the attack's survivors and [...] "at least five other villagers" [...] described seeing a number of soldiers, while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman. [...] One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, reported involvement {{of a large number}} of people: [...] "When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into the house... I saw more than 20 people when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> the house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling me not to leave the house or they'd kill me." [...] An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak, whose father was killed, reported that [...] "one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights." [...] The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen [...] "numerous soldiers" [...] with headlamps and lighted guns. [...] Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned, claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help. In response, Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} his wedding, Wedge {{had been}} {{committed}} to the psychiatric ward in the Highland Hospital in Oakland, California for observation after admitting to an alienist {{that he had been}} obsessed with either strangling his new wife or defenestrating her during their honeymoon. Wedge also confessed that [...] "for several months I have been fighting a desire to kill myself. For weeks I would want to slash my throat every time I picked up a razor. Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of a high window I wanted to jump out. I am a sick man and for my own protection and for the protection of my loved ones I want to be locked up and be placed where I can harm neither myself or anyone else". Wedge believed his condition was caused by damage caused by a frontal skull fracture sustained in a saloon fight about 1899, and exacerbated by the stress caused by the publicity surrounding his wedding and resignation from the church.|$|E
