40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{user-friendly}} and simple tool for fast and accurate estimation of Normal Tissue Complication Probabilities (NTCP) for several radiobiological models, which {{can be used as a}} valuable complement to the clinical experience. Materials and methods: The software which has been named DORES (<b>Dose</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Software) has been developed in Visual Basic, and includes three NTCP models (Lyman-Kuther-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality and Parallel). Required input information includes the Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) for the Organs at Risk (OAR) of each treatment, the number of fractions and the total dose of therapy. Results: NTCP values are computed, and subsequently placed in a spreadsheet file for further analysis. A Dose Response curve for every model is automatically generated. Every patient of the study population can be found on the curve since by definition their corresponding dose-response points fall exactly on the theoretical dose-response curve, when plotted on the same diagram. Conclusion: Distributions of absorbed dose alone do not provide information on the biological response of tissues to irradiation, so the use of this software may aid in the comparison of outcomes for different treatment plans or types of treatment, and also aid the evaluation of the sensitivity of different model predictions to uncertainties in parameter values. This was illustrated in a clinical case of breast cancer radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinases are {{important}} to the growth of some sarcomas. Flavopiridol is a pan-CDK inhibitor that has been shown to potentiate chemotherapy. As such, we explored the potentiation of doxorubicin by flavopiridol in sarcoma, in vitro and in vivo, and conducted a phase I trial of flavopiridol with doxorubicin in patients with advanced sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sarcoma cell lines and xenografts were treated with flavopiridol alone and in combination with doxorubicin. In the phase I study, doxorubicin and flavopiridol were administered on two flavopiridol schedules; a 1 -hour bolus and split dosing as a 30 -minute bolus followed by a 4 -hour infusion. RESULTS: Preclinically, flavopiridol potentiated doxorubicin. In vivo, doxorubicin administered 1 hour before flavopiridol was more active than doxorubicin alone. Clinically, 31 patients were enrolled on protocol and flavopiridol was escalated to target dose in two schedules (90 mg/m(2) bolus; 50 mg/m(2) bolus + 40 mg/m(2) infusion) both in combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)). Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia but no maximum tolerated dose was defined. Flavopiridol pharmacokinetics showed increasing C(max) with increasing <b>dose.</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) responses included two partial responses, however, stable disease was seen in 16 patients. Of 12 evaluable patients with progressive well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, eight had stable disease greater than 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The sequential combination of doxorubicin followed by flavopiridol is well tolerated on both schedules.

40|$|In {{developed}} countries with westernized diets, the excessive consumption of added sugar in beverages and highly refined and processed foods {{is associated with}} increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. As a major constituent of added sugars, fructose {{has been shown to}} cause a variety of adverse metabolic effects, such as impaired insulin sensitivity, hypertriglyceridemia, and oxidative stress. Recent studies have shown that ketohexokinase isoform C is the key enzyme responsible in fructose metabolism that drive's fructose's adverse effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify botanical ingredients with potential for inhibitory activity against ketohexokinase-C and fructose-induced metabolic effects by using a series of in vitro model systems. Extracts from 406 botanicals and 1200 purified phytochemicals were screened (initial concentration of 50 μg/mL and 50 μM, respectively) for their inhibitory activity using a cell free, recombinant human ketohexokinase-C assay. <b>Dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>evaluations</b> were conducted on botanical extracts and phytochemicals that inhibited ketohexokinase-C by > 30 % and > 40 %, respectively. Two different extract lots of the top botanical candidates were further evaluated in lysates of HepG 2 cells overexpressing ketohexokinase-C for inhibition of fructose-induced ATP depletion. In addition, extracts were evaluated in intact Hep G 2 cells for inhibition of fructose-induced elevation of triglyceride and uric acid production. Among the botanical extracts, phloretin (Malus domestica) extracts were the most potent (IC 50 : 8. 9 - 9. 2 μg/mL) followed by extracts of Angelica archangelica (IC 50 : 22. 6 μg/mL- 57. 3 μg/mL). Among the purified phytochemicals, methoxy-isobavachalcone (Psoralea corylifolia, IC 50 = 0. 2 μM) exhibited the highest potency against ketohexokinase isoform C activity followed by osthole (Angelica archangelica, IC 50 = 0. 7 μM), cratoxyarborenone E (Cratoxylum prunifolium, IC 50 = 1. 0 μM), and α-/γ-mangostin (Cratoxylum prunifolium, IC 50 = 1. 5 μM). Extracts of Angelica archangelica, Garcinia mangostana, Petroselinum crispum, and Scutellaria baicalensis exhibited ketohexokinase inhibitory activity and blocked fructose-induced ATP depletion and fructose-induced elevation in triglyerides and uric acid. Angelica archangelica, Garcinia mangostana, Petroselinum crispum, and Scutellaria baicalensis were the top four botanical candidiates identified with inhibitory activity against ketohexokinase-C.

Mevinphos {{is used to}} control aphids, mites, grasshoppers, cutworms, leafhoppers caterpillars, and many other insects on {{a broad range of}} field, forage, vegetable, and fruit crops. Eleven products containing mevinphos are registered in California.

This consensus document informs on interference with the IL- 6 pathway based on evidence and expert opinion. Methods: Preparation of this document involved international experts in RA treatment and RA patients. A systematic literature search was performed that focused on TCZ and other IL 6 -pathway inhibitors in RA and other diseases. Subsequently, incorporating available published evidence and expert opinion, the steering committee and a broader expert committee (both including RA patients) formulated the current consensus statement. Results: The consensus statement covers use of TCZ as combination- or monotherapy in various RA populations and includes clinical, functional and structural aspects. The statement also addresses the second approved indication in Europe JIA and non-approved indications. Also early phase trials involving additional agents that target the IL- 6 receptor or IL- 6 were evaluated. Safety concerns, including haematological, hepatic and metabolic issues as well as infections, are addressed likewise. Conclusions: The consensus statement identifies points to consider when using TCZ, regarding indications, contraindications, screening, <b>dose,</b> comedication, <b>response</b> <b>evaluation</b> and safety.

The risk assessment process consists of four aspects: hazard identification, <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> assessment, exposure <b>evaluation,</b> and risk characterization.

The dose-response assessment then considers the toxicological properties and estimates the amount which could potentially cause an adverse effect.

A basic premise of toxicology is that at a high enough dose, virtually all substances will cause some toxic manifestation. Chemicals are {{often referred to as}} "dangerous " or "safe", as though these concepts were absolutes. In reality, these terms describe chemicals which require low or high dosages, respectively, to cause toxic effects. Toxicological activity is determined in a battery of experimental studies which define the kinds of toxic effects which can be caused, and the exposure levels (doses) at which effects may be seen.

The efficacy of antimicrobial mixtures that would be classified as synergistic by time-kill methodology was {{shown to be a}} natural consequence of combining antimicrobials with non-linear <b>dose</b> <b>responses.</b> Conclusions: The effectiveness of admixtures of biocides and other antimicrobials with non-linear <b>dose</b> <b>responses</b> can be predicted.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{important}} to quantify the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> for a drug in phase 2 a clinical trials so the optimal doses can then be selected for subsequent late phase trials. In a phase 2 a clinical trial of new lead drug being developed {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a U-shaped <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> curve was observed. In the light of this result further research was undertaken to design an efficient phase 2 a proof of concept (PoC) trial for a follow-on compound using the lessons learnt from the lead compound. Methods The planned analysis for the Phase 2 a trial for GSK 123456 was a Bayesian Emax model which assumes the dose-response relationship follows a monotonic sigmoid “S” shaped curve. This model was found to be suboptimal to model the U-shaped <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> observed in the data from this trial and alternatives approaches were needed to be considered for the next compound for which a Normal dynamic linear model (NDLM) is proposed. This paper compares the statistical properties of the Bayesian Emax model and NDLM model and both models are evaluated using simulation in the context of adaptive Phase 2 a PoC design under a variety of assumed <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> curves: linear, Emax model, U-shaped model, and flat response. Results It is shown that the NDLM method is flexible and can handle a wide variety of dose-responses, including monotonic and non-monotonic relationships. In comparison to the NDLM model the Emax model excelled with higher probability of selecting ED 90 and smaller average sample size, when the true <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> followed Emax like curve. In addition, the type I error, probability of incorrectly concluding a drug may work when it does not, is inflated with the Bayesian NDLM model in all scenarios which would represent a development risk to pharmaceutical company. The bias, which is the difference between the estimated effect from the Emax and NDLM models and the simulated value, is comparable if the true <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> follows a placebo like curve, an Emax like curve, or log linear shape curve under fixed dose allocation, no adaptive allocation, half adaptive and adaptive scenarios. The bias though is significantly increased for the Emax model if the true <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> follows a U-shaped curve. Conclusions In most cases the Bayesian Emax model works effectively and efficiently, with low bias and good probability of success in case of monotonic <b>dose</b> <b>response.</b> However, if there is a belief that the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> could be non-monotonic then the NDLM is the superior model to assess the <b>dose</b> <b>response...</b>|$|R
