60|$|Poets and moralists, {{judging from}} our English trees and fruits, {{have thought that}} small fruits always grew on lofty trees, so that their fall should be {{harmless}} to man, while the large ones trailed on the ground.

Her local myths and local sacra seem, on the whole, less barbaric than those of many other Olympians. But in comparing the conjectures of the learned, one lesson comes out with astonishing clearness.

60|$|A man so much {{in earnest}} soon became a most {{acceptable}} and popular preacher. He studied his sermons carefully, and wrote such memorandums and notes as might refresh his memory before going into the pulpit, although his intensity of feeling, his ready utterance, and natural eloquence which charmed his hearers, and his extensive usefulness as a preacher, render it quite improbable that he restricted himself to notes while publicly engaged in sacred services. They must have aided him {{when he did not}} enjoy liberty of utterance. 'At times when I have begun to speak the Word with much liberty, I have been presently so straitened in speech that I scarcely knew what I was about, or as if my head had been in a bag.'[177] They were valuable, also, as a proof that all he said had its <b>exclusive</b> <b>reference</b> to the world to come, without the mixture of politics, which might have given offence to the Government. Thus, when he was apprehended for neglecting to attend the church service and for preaching the gospel, in his conversation with Mr. Cobb, the magistrate's clerk, he said 'that, to cut off all occasions of suspicion from any, as touching the harmlessness of my doctrine, in private I would willingly take the pains to give any one the notes of all my sermons, for I do sincerely desire to live quietly in my country, and to submit to the present authority.'[178] In such troublesome times these would afford abundant proof that he was desirous of submitting to all the political institutions of his country, while he dared not conform to human laws affecting his faith or his mode of worshipping God, for which he alone was to stand answerable at the great day.|$|E

6000|$|Dr. Cumming’s theory, {{as we have}} seen, is that {{actions are}} good or evil {{according}} as they are prompted or not prompted by an <b>exclusive</b> <b>reference</b> to the “glory of God.” God, then, in Dr. Cumming’s conception, is a being who has no pleasure {{in the exercise of}} love and truthfulness and justice, considered as affecting the well-being of his creatures; He has satisfaction in us only in so far as we exhaust our motives and dispositions of all relation to our fellow-beings, and replace sympathy with men by anxiety for the “glory of God.” The deed of Grace Darling, when she took a boat in the storm to rescue drowning men and women, was not good if it was only compassion that nerved her arm and impelled her to brave death for the chance of saving others; it was only good if she asked herself—Will this redound to the glory of God? The man who endures tortures rather than betray a trust, the man who spends years in toil in order to discharge an obligation from which the law declares him free, must be animated not by the spirit of fidelity to his fellow-man, but by a desire to make “the name of God more known.” The sweet charities of domestic life—the ready hand and the soothing word in sickness, the forbearance toward frailties, the prompt helpfulness in all efforts and sympathy in all joys, are simply evil if they result from a “constitutional tendency,” or from dispositions disciplined by the experience of suffering and the perception of moral loveliness. A wife is not to devote herself to her husband out of love to him and a sense of the duties implied by a close relation—she is to be a faithful wife for the glory of God; if she feels her natural affections welling up too strongly, she is to repress them; it will not do to act from natural affection—she must think of the glory of God. A man is to guide his affairs with energy and discretion, not from an honest desire to fulfil his responsibilities as a member of society and a father, but—that “God’s praise may be sung.” Dr. Cumming’s Christian pays his debts for the glory of God; {{were it not for the}} coercion of that supreme motive, it would be evil to pay them. A man is not to be just from a feeling of justice; he is not to help his fellow-men out of good-will to his fellow-men; he is not to be a tender husband and father out of affection: all these natural muscles and fibres are to be torn away and replaced by a patent steel-spring—anxiety for the “glory of God.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{principle}} is thus far obvious; {{but there are}} real difficulties in its application, and we will begin by stating them in their greatest force. If {{it is important that}} the electors should choose a representative more highly instructed than themselves, it is no less necessary that this wiser man should be responsible to them; in other words, they are the judges of the manner in which he fulfils his trust; and how are they to judge, except by the standard of their own opinions? How are they even to select him in the first instance but by the same standard? It will not do to choose by mere brilliancy--by superiority of showy talent. The tests by which an ordinary man can judge beforehand of mere ability are very imperfect; such as they are, they have almost <b>exclusive</b> <b>reference</b> to the arts of expression, and little or none to the worth of what is expressed. The latter can not be inferred from the former; and if the electors are to put their own opinions in abeyance, what criterion remains to them of the ability to govern well? Neither, if they could ascertain, even infallibly, the ablest man, ought they to allow him altogether to judge for them, without any reference to their own opinions. The ablest candidate may be a Tory, and the electors Liberals; or a Liberal, and they may be Tories. The political questions of the day may be Church questions, and he may be a High-Churchman or a Rationalist, while they may be Dissenters or Evangelicals, and vice versâ. His abilities, in these cases, might only enable him to go greater lengths, and act with greater effect, in what they may conscientiously believe to be a wrong course; and they may be bound, by their sincere convictions, to think it more important that their representative should be kept, on these points, to what they deem the dictate of duty, than that they should be represented by a person of more than average abilities. They may also have to consider, not solely how they can be most ably represented, but how their particular moral position and mental point of view shall be represented at all. The influence of every mode of thinking which is shared by numbers ought to be felt in the Legislature; and the Constitution being supposed to have made due provision that other and conflicting modes of thinking shall be represented likewise, to secure the proper representation for their own mode may be the most important matter which the electors on the particular occasion have to attend to. In some cases, too, it may be necessary that the representative should have his hands tied to keep him true to their interest, or rather to the public interest as they conceive it. This would not be needful under a political system which assured them an indefinite choice of honest and unprejudiced candidates; but under the existing system, in which the electors are almost always obliged, by the expenses of election and the general circumstances of society, to select their representative from persons of a station in life widely different from theirs, and having a different class interest, who will affirm that they ought to abandon themselves to his discretion? Can we blame an elector of the poorer classes, who has only the choice among two or three rich men, for requiring from the one he votes for a pledge to those measures which he considers as a test of emancipation from the class interests of the rich? It will, moreover, always happens to some members of the electoral body to be obliged to accept the representative selected by a majority of their own side. But, though a candidate of their own choosing would have no chance, their votes may be necessary to the success of the one chosen for them, and their only means of exerting their share of influence on his subsequent conduct may be to make their support of him dependent on his pledging himself to certain conditions.|$|E

This paper reports on an attempt to apply a frame of reference to the selection of criteria for evaluating technological innovations in higher education. Defining the types of innovation to be evaluated is an issue but establishing evaluation criteria is the major challenge. Four positions are considered. One is oriented to the stated objectives of the particular educational innovation; one to comparison with alternative educational approaches; one to the benefits and costs anticipated from {{a knowledge of the}} state of the art of learning technologies; and one to criteria developed from a particular educational and/or social theory. These four approaches to are interactive rather than <b>exclusive</b> zones of <b>reference,</b> each of which has a place in selecting criteria for evaluation of educational innovations employing learning technologies. To engage all four, exposes contests between theoretical foundations, public policy, local pragmatics and individual objectives. Evaluation in this context, then, identifies dialectical relationships and provides a transformative tool for the construction and reconstruction of technology in education. In the background are issues of causation in complex educational contexts. Attaining generalisable conclusions from the evaluation of educational technologies, however, is problematic and beyond the scope of an evaluative approach. The paper reports on an evaluation of an innovation that combined the introduction of problem-based learning with Web-based tuition in a post-graduate course conducted at an Australian university...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991, the REQUASUD {{network has}} been {{organizing}} food microbiology proficiency testing (PT) proposing authentic food matrices {{with or without}} artificial inoculation. In parallel, sterile food matrices and reference materials, artificially spiked at comparable levels, have been proposed as controls. ISO 22117 (Specific requirements and guidelines for food microbiology proficiency testing) specifies that the PT items should be {{as close as possible}} to routine samples, in order to accurately reflect the potential bias linked to the matrix. Most food microbiology PT organizers only provide sterile items (e. g. reference materials or irradiated samples), artificially inoculated. Although this protocol enables to produce high amounts of matrix, with a multi-parameters inoculation, a precise assigned value and a satisfying stability of the contamination levels over time, the artificial samples produced may not adequately represent the true challenges of natural matrices. Naturally contaminated food matrices raise huge challenges for the PT organizers in terms of standardization, processing and stabilization, but they are much closer to the laboratories real-life conditions.

5000|$|A quantum {{system is}} described, at every instant, by a vector state which, {{according}} to the theory, represents {{the maximum amount of}} information {{that it is possible to}} have. To simplify discussion, taking the example of the state of polarization of a photon and associate with it the vector state [...] The knowledge of the vector state, in fact, provides us exclusively with information on the possible results of measurements which we decide to carry out on the system. For example, in the case just referred to we know that if we were toapply a test for vertical polarization to the photon whose state is , it would have a probability of 1/2 of passing and 1/2 of failing. But the theory, which usually provides only probabilistic information on the results of hypothetical measurements, can, with reference to particular tests, assign the value 1 or 0 to the probability of obtaining specific results. So, in the case we are considering, the theory tells us that the photon has a probability of 1 of passing through a filter polarized at 45°, and a probability of 0 of passing through a filter polarized at 135°. In this case, and with precise and <b>exclusive</b> <b>reference</b> to the observables (polarization at 45° and 135°) for which we know a priori the results of measurement, we can assert that the photon possesses the property in question: it is polarized at 45° or [...] "possesses the property which guarantees that it will pass with certainty a test at 45°." [...] This is an important distinction with the situation in classical mechanics: in classical physics, any system always possesses precise values for all of the observables that we can conceive, but in quantum physics, a single system will indeed possess some property, but, with reference to other properties, we can do no better than make probabilistic prediction about the results of possible measurements, of and when they are actually executed. In a certain sense the theory teaches us that a system must not have too many properties and that, in particular, some are incompatible with others. So, for example, a photon that is [...] "polarized at 45°" [...] does not possess any definite property relative to vertical or horizontal polarization.
