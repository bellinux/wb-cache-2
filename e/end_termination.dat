50|$|Termination of the mRNA {{product is}} encoded for within the cDNA of the gene. The <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> of an mRNA product {{generally}} has three main features: the poly A signal, the poly A tail, and {{an area of}} sequence that can form a stem loop structure. The poly A signal is a highly conserved site, six nucleotide long sequence. In eukaryotes the sequence is AATAAA and is located about 10-30 nucleotides from the poly A site. The AATAAA sequence is a highly conserved, eukaryotic polyA signal that signals for polyadenylation of the mRNA product 10-30 base pairs after the signal sequence. The polyA site for C11orf73 is GTA.|$|E

40|$|The silver paste with {{ceramics}} addition as <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> {{was performed}} on multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) based on ZnO-B 2 O 3 + Zn 0. 95 Mg 0. 05 TiO 3 + 0. 25 TiO(2) ceramic (ZnBO-ZMT) with Ag 95 -PdO 5 internal electrodes. A green sheet was prepared by tape casting using the ZnBO-ZMT' powders. Ag 95 -PdO 5 was attached on the green sheet as an internal electrode. After lamination, the green chips were pre-sintered at 800 degrees C for 1 h, then samples were dipped the external electrodes and were cofired together at 900 degrees C for 2 h. There is no extra curing process, so the production cost may be cut down and thermal shock of the MLCCs may be reduced. To improve the mismatch between <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> and dielectric body during sintering, the silver paste with different amounts of ceramics, e. g., 20, 30 and 40 wt. %, was added in this study. The mechanical and electrical properties of the MLCCs were investigated subsequently. The results showed that <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> with 40 wt. % ceramic addition has good performances on mechanical properties of MLCC, but equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is a little bit}} higher compared to <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> with 20 and 30 wt. % ceramic addition.

40|$|The {{electrodynamic}} {{interaction of}} long metallic tethers with the ionosphere is introduced. Due to the tether's motion across the Earth's field, a polarization electric field is generated along the tether. In a system like the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) where the tether is coated with dielectric and the electrical contact is between its two terminations and the ionosphere, the upper <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> will collect electrons and, in a passive system, the lower <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> will collect ions. Space charge regions will develop around the two terminations of the system, {{which can be}} at considerable potential {{with respect to the}} unperturbed ionospheric plasma and the current in the tether will be most significantly determined by local processes in such space charge regions. A qualitative view of the global perturbation induced by TSS in the ionosphere is outlined. One of the applications of electrodynamic tethers is that of using them as low frequency wave generators to communicate to the Earth. This application is briefly discussed. An equivalent circuit of the tether system is described. The basic equation of the circuit is given...|$|E

40|$|The laminar to {{turbulent}} {{transition of}} a circular cylinder wake was investigated experimentally, examining a range of features leading to an aperiodic three-dimensional structure and a possible mechanism causing the route to turbulence was postulated. Following {{the analysis of the}} Stuart-Landau equations defining a Hopf bifurcation at the primary instability, a new relationship between the Strouhal number (St) and the Reynolds number (Re) was formed, providing agreement with a range of equations defined experimentally. The St-Re relationship was examined for a range of mechanisms modifying the cylinder's <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> and a variation in the free-stream turbulence level. It was ascertained that the <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> had a direct influence on the wake dynamics, producing a change in the wake structure leading to the possibility of parallel vortex shedding and also a modification of the critical Reynolds number. Following the introduction of specific boundary conditions, it was ascertained that the critical Reynolds number could be delayed to a value of 192. Although an increased level of free-stream turbulence demonstrated a reduction in the critical Reynolds number for all end conditions imposed. Within a small range of Reynolds numbers prior to transition, random wake irregularities identified within the laminar velocity signal. These were ascertained to be generated from finite three-dimensional perturbations within the wake, introduced by the method of <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> and the increased level of free-stream turbulence. Following the analysis of these intermittent aperiodic bursts within the transition regime, they were demonstrated to relate to the occurrence of turbulent flow prior to transition. This produced an alternate switching between the two states relating to the hysteretic bifurcation to the mode A wake structure. A possible transition mechanism causing a route to turbulence was considered, relating to the statistics of these intermittent bursts. Leading to a proposal that the cylinder wake transition undergoes a noise induced dynamic forcing, which is consistent with on-off intermittency.

40|$|Glass fiber {{is unique}} {{in its ability to}} {{withstand}} atomic oxygen and ultraviolet radiation in-space environments. However, glass fiber is also difficult to terminate by traditional methods without decreasing its strength significantly. Glass fiber products are especially sensitive to bend radius, and do not work very well with traditional 'sewn loop on pin' type connections. As with most composites, getting applied loads from a metallic structure into the webbing without stress concentrations is the key to a successful design. A potted <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> has been shown in some preliminary work to out-perform traditional termination methods. It was proposed to conduct a series of tensile tests on structural webbing or cord to determine the optimum potting geometry, and to then be able to estimate a weight and volume savings over traditional sewn-overa- pin connections. During the course of the investigation into potted end terminations for glass fiber webbing, a new and innovative connection was developed that has lower weight, reduced fabrication time, and superior thermal tolerance over the metallic end terminations that were to be optimized in the original proposal. This <b>end</b> <b>termination</b> essentially transitions the flexible glass fiber webbing into a rigid fiberglass termination, which can be bolted/fastened with traditional method...|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the effect}} of the {{terminations}} is to cause a rounding of the frequency response at cut-off. The image method predicts a sharp discontinuity in the slope of the response at cut-off which is not realised in practice, although a well designed image filter may get close to this. Another prediction of the image method is zero loss in the passband (assuming ideal lossless components). Again, this cannot be achieved in practice because reflections from the <b>end</b> <b>terminations</b> always cause some loss.|$|R

5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks.

However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with <b>end</b> <b>terminations.</b> Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|R
