5|$|Around the mid-1980s, <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> representatives {{decided to}} rebuild the old Japanese embassy in Berlin from 1938. Its remains had {{remained}} unused after the building was largely destroyed during World War II. In addition to the original complex, several changes and additions were made until 2000, like moving the main entrance to the Hiroshima Street, which was named in honour of the Japanese city, {{and the creation of}} a traditional Japanese Garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 the Royal Navy {{commissioned}} six {{light aircraft}} carriers {{in an effort}} to counter the <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> navies. The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.|$|E

5|$|The target fleet {{included}} four obsolete U.S. battleships, two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, eleven destroyers, eight submarines, numerous auxiliary and amphibious vessels, {{and three}} surrendered <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> ships. The ships carried sample amounts {{of fuel and}} ammunition, plus scientific instruments to measure air pressure, ship movement, and radiation. The live animals {{on some of the}} target ships were supplied by the support ship , which brought 200 pigs, 60 guinea pigs, 204 goats, 5,000 rats, 200 mice, and grains containing insects to be studied for genetic effects by the National Cancer Institute. Amphibious target ships were beached on Bikini Island.|$|E
5|$|Waldron married {{twice and}} had seven {{children}} – two {{with his first}} wife and five with the second. Billie Holiday was godmother to his first daughter. Waldron's first wife, Elaine, occasionally sang on his recordings. His second wife was Japanese, and they owned and let several apartments in Japan. Combining birthday celebrations with a tour, Waldron took both families – ex-wife, wife, seven children and two grandchildren – on his three-week tour of Japan that coincided with his seventieth birthday. Waldron's mother died in 1979. He could speak English, French, <b>German,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War {{was officially}} {{concluded}} with the capitulation of the Empire of Japan, plans for trying the major <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> war criminals were quickly implemented in 1946. While Japanese officials {{had to face}} the Tokyo Trials, major German war crimes were dealt with at the Nuremberg Trials. Here it was the goal of the Allied prosecutors to portray the limited cooperation between the Third Reich and Imperial Japan as a long-planned conspiracy to divide the world among the two Axis-partners and thereby delivering just another demonstration of the common viciousness expressed by alleged joint long-term war plans. According to modern historic research, however, such a conspiracy did not exist and is considered Allied propaganda. Although there was a limited and cautious military cooperation between Japan and Germany during the Second World War, no documents corroborating any long-term planning or real coordination of military operations of both powers exist.|$|E

5|$|Although Australia was {{remote from}} the main battlefronts, there was {{considerable}} Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War. A total of 54 <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. In addition, many Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled several Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the total}} number of deaths in World WarII, {{approximately}} 85 per cent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the Allied side and 15 per cent were on the Axis side. Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces in occupied territories. An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died either as a direct or as an indirect result of Nazi racist policies, including the Holocaust of around 6 million Jews, half of whom were Polish citizens, along with a further minimum 1.9 million ethnic Poles. Millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), Roma, homosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups were also killed. Hundreds of thousands (varying estimates) of ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia, and retribution-related killings were committed just after the war ended.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{enlarged}} the ocean-going type IX U-boat {{design to}} an extended range type IXD1 variant with torpedo tubes removed and battery capacity reduced to increase cargo capacity for transport of strategic materials between <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> ports.

25|$|By {{the end of}} war, {{thousands}} of captive soldiers and officers of <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> armies were sentenced to several years of work in labour camps in all the regions of Siberia. These camps were directed by a different administration than Gulag. Although Soviet camps hadn't the purpose to lead prisoners to death, the death rate was significant, especially in winters. The range of works differed from vegetable farming to construction of the Baikal Amur Mainline.|$|E
25|$|Colombia's {{source of}} {{platinum}} was another important issue. Colombia {{was the only}} source of platinum for the <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> war industries, and the United States moved quickly to buy out the entire supply through the Metals Reserve Company, which was an agency of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Since the United States also needed additional supplies of platinum for its war effort, it assisted Colombia with technical advice on increasing production through the Foreign Economic Administration.|$|E
25|$|This period {{also saw}} the first major {{collaboration}} between East and West. Collaboration in Pforzheim between <b>German</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese</b> artists led to Shakudō plaques set into Filigree frames being created by the Stoeffler firm in 1885). Perhaps the grand finalé – and an appropriate transition to the following period – were the masterful creations of the Russian artist Peter Carl Fabergé, working for the Imperial Russian court, whose Fabergé eggs and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmith’s art.|$|E

40|$|Utilizing three student (Study 1) and non-student samples (Study 2), we {{examined}} cultural differences in workplace choice for North Americans, <b>Germans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Japanese.</b> We {{focused on the}} desire for control as a potential mediator (i. e., the underlying mechanism) to explain cultural differences in this important life decision. Given culturally divergent embodiments of independent vs. interdependent models of agency, we expected and found that, compared to North Americans <b>and</b> <b>Germans,</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{were more likely to}} prefer a workplace with a payment system that maintains social order rather than one that rewards individual achievement. Furthermore, we found that Japanese tend to give greater consideration to family opinions in their choice of workplace. As predicted, desire for control (i. e., the motivation to have control over various events) was stronger for North Americans <b>and</b> <b>Germans</b> than <b>Japanese,</b> <b>and</b> explained cultural differences in choice of workplace...|$|R
