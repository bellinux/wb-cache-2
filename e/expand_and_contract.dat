5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{molecule}} is predicted to be an equilateral triangle. Vibrations can occur in the molecule in two ways, firstly the molecule can <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> retaining the equilateral triangle shape (breathing), or one atom can move relative to the others distorting the triangle (bending). The bending vibration has a dipole moment and thus couples to infrared radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} system of birds differs significantly from {{that found in}} mammals. Firstly they have rigid lungs which do not <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> during the breathing cycle. Instead an extensive system of air sacs (Fig.15) distributed throughout their bodies act as the bellows drawing environmental air into the sacs, and expelling the spent air after it has passed through the lungs (Fig.18). Birds also do not have diaphragms or pleural cavities.|$|E

25|$|Gaelic Ireland {{consisted}} of {{as few as}} five {{and as many as}} nine Primary kingdoms (Cuaighe) which were often subdivided into many minor smaller kingdoms (Tutha).

Until the end of Gaelic Ireland they continued to fluctuate, <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> in size, as well as dissolving entirely or being amalgamated into new entities.

25|$|Although {{minor and}} gentle {{fluctuations}} in RH can reasonably be withstood by most collections, quick or drastic shifts can be harmful.

The non-perturbative massive solutions do not appear to exhibit instabil-ities and describe vacuum configurations which are periodic in time, including purely longitudinal solutions with isotropic periodically <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> spatial dimensions, “cosmological strings ” with only one peri-odically <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> spatial dimension, <b>and</b> also purely non-longitudinal (“traceless”) periodically <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> solutions with constant spatial volume. As an aside we also discuss massive solutions in New Massive Gravity. While such solutions are present in the linearized theory, we argue that already at the next-to-linear (quadratic) order in the equations of motion (and, more generally, for weak-field configurations) there are no massive solutions...|$|R
25|$|Many short bridge spans are statically {{anchored}} {{at one end}} {{and attached}} to rockers at the other. This rocker gives vertical and transverse support while allowing the bridge span to <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> with temperature changes. The change in the length of the span is accommodated over a gap in the roadway by comb-like expansion joints. During severe ground motion, the rockers may jump from their tracks or be moved beyond their design limits, causing the bridge to unship from its resting point and then either become misaligned or fail completely. Motion can be constrained by adding ductile or high-strength steel restraints that are friction-clamped to beams and designed to slide under extreme stress while still limiting the motion relative to the anchorage.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals.

The lower rump is covered by a basket of eighteen pairs of gastralia or belly ribs. Mysterious shaft parts present near the forelimbs are by Dal Sasso & Maganuco interpreted as {{the remains of a}} nineteenth frontmost element consisting of two completely fused shafts homologous to the normal medial elements of a pair of gastralia; such a chevron-like bone has also been reported with Juravenator. The gastralia form a herringbone pattern, the left and right medial elements overlapping each other at their forked ends in order that the basket can <b>expand</b> <b>and</b> <b>contract</b> to accommodate the breathing movements of the abdomen.|$|E
