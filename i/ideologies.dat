40|$|The {{research}} question of this master’s thesis is: 'to what extent does Žižek’s rethinking of <b>ideology</b> and <b>ideology</b> critique, as formulated in his The Sublime Object of <b>Ideology,</b> facilitate an <b>ideology</b> {{critique of the}} liberal-capitalist society as it was envisaged by the Frankfurt School?' My thesis is that Žižek’s rethinking of <b>ideology</b> makes {{a new kind of}} <b>ideology</b> critique possible, one which is fundamentally different from the <b>ideology</b> critique of the Frankfurt School. It will be shown that Žižek differs from the Frankfurt school in that he excludes the possibility of freeing oneself fully from ideological delusions. However, Žižek’s <b>ideology</b> critique still provides a moment of resistance against <b>ideology</b> and hence a moment of freedom. This makes Žižek’s rethinking of <b>ideology</b> and <b>ideology</b> critique a critical theory of society, despite the differences with the Frankfurt School. An implication of this thesis seems to be that it establishes the urgency of thinking about a reaction to today’s <b>ideology</b> in order to establish a more just society...|$|R

40|$|While the {{psychological}} underpinnings of social <b>ideology</b> are well established, less {{is known about}} {{the psychological}} underpinnings of economic <b>ideology.</b> In this study I assess whether Big Five personality traits are associated with economic <b>ideology</b> and when personality traits are more strongly or more weakly associated with economic <b>ideology.</b> I hypothesize that low income attenuates the association between the Big Five traits and economic <b>ideology.</b> Studies conducted in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States show that Conscientiousness is positively correlated with economic conservatism, while Agreeableness and Neuroticism are negatively correlated with economic conservatism. Moreover, low income attenuates the association between personality traits and economic <b>ideology.</b> I report a weaker association between Agreeableness and economic <b>ideology</b> among poor people compared to wealthier people in all three countries. Low income also attenuates the association between economic <b>ideology</b> and the traits Openness (Denmark), Extraversion (U. K.) and Neuroticism (U. S.). I contribute to the literature addressing the psychological correlates of economic <b>ideology</b> by showing that (1) economic <b>ideology</b> has a distinct set of personality correlates and (2) low income attenuates the association between some personality traits and economic <b>ideology...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{division}} {{in studies of}} language <b>ideology</b> is between neutral and critical approaches to <b>ideology.</b> [...] In neutral approaches to language <b>ideology,</b> speakers’ beliefs or ideas about language are understood as being shaped by the cultural systems {{in which they are}} embedded, but no attempt to identify variation within or across these systems is made. Often, a single <b>ideology</b> will be identified in such cases. Characterizations of language <b>ideology</b> as representative of an entire community or culture, such as those routinely documented in ethnographic research, are common examples of neutral approaches to language <b>ideology.</b>|$|R

5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and <b>ideologies</b> have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims.

5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many of the ingredients of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and {{a significant number of}} peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by <b>ideologies</b> such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical <b>ideologies,</b> spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common <b>ideologies</b> in Indonesia; this led him to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those <b>ideologies.</b> Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of the older generation of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than many contemporary writers and wrote in a similar style to the older authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have led him to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E

5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their <b>ideologies</b> were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their <b>ideologies</b> in more detail, but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political <b>ideologies,</b> such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, {{under the}} strain of World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism.

E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially.
