Some technical innovations are done such as fixing smooth magnetic mandrel or slot magnetic mandrel {{and so on}} in the workpiece interior for improving the structure style of the working space and characteristic of magnetic field. Experiments on thin sleeve of Al alloy are done and their finishing effects are contrasted. Research results indicate that <b>fixing</b> <b>slot</b> magnetic spindle in the workpiece interior can increase efficiency and improve quality for large thin non-magnetic sleeve...|$|E

The slurry mass balance equation is an elliptic PDE and is solved by an implicit method, and the shock-capturing methods discussed earlier are not applied {{to solve this}} PDE. We applied different shock-capturing techniques to the 2 -D proppant transport problem in a <b>fixed</b> <b>slot</b> to examine their performance with respect to accuracy and spurious oscillations.

Finally, we presented the result of proppant injection into the <b>fixed</b> <b>slot</b> using the best-performing numerical technique until the whole fracture was filled up with proppants.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, German {{aircraft}} commonly fitted a {{more advanced}} version that pushed back flush against the wing by air pressure to reduce drag, popping out when the angle of attack increased during slower flight.

These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were <b>fixed</b> non-retractable <b>slots.</b> The slotted wing allowed this aircraft to take off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch-designed Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, which used <b>fixed</b> <b>slots</b> built integrally with, and just behind the wing panel's outer leading edges instead.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{effectiveness}} of the proposed TTR MAC, we conduct the TTR MAC in MATLAB and compare the simulation results with the two ubiquitous MAC protocols. One protocol is the IEEE 802.15. 6, where the hub assigns <b>fixed</b> allocation <b>slot</b> number for each sensor node without considering the heterogenous data arrival rates. Nodes will contend for the channel in CSMA/CA if the allocated slots are insufficient to transmit their data. The other protocol represents a kind of protocol which is based on one-round reservation to adapt the diverse data arrival rates, named OR MAC here. In the OR MAC, the hub first assigns a <b>fixed</b> <b>slot</b> for each node to inform its data volume. Once collecting all information about buffered data from all nodes, the hub assigns allocation slots for each node based on the collected information.|$|R

Here we present a simple, light-weight, and selfstabilizing MAC protocol, namely Busy Elimination Multiple Access (BEMA) protocol, for solving the reliable multicast problem. BEMA grants on-demand access to the channel —rather than assigning <b>fixed</b> <b>slots</b> as in TDMA based approaches — and supports prioritization of traffic, thereby providing a useful building block for applications with reliability and quality-of-service requirements. ...|$|R
50|$|Partial-span slots {{are usually}} found {{only on the}} {{outboard}} portion of the wing where they ensure airflow over {{that portion of the}} wing will remain unstalled at higher angles of attack than the inboard portions of the wing. This ensures the wing root stalls first and contributes to docile stall behaviour and maintaining aileron control throughout the stall. Using slots in this manner produces a similar result to employing washout on a wing, but through a different means. Examples of aircraft with partial-span, <b>fixed</b> <b>slots</b> are the Stinson 108, Bristol Beaufort, Lockheed Hudson, and Dornier Do 28D-2 Skyservant.|$|R
