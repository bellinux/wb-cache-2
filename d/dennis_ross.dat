With Richard von Weizsäcker, former President of Germany, and Henry A.

The American Academy in Berlin opened three years later in a villa on the Wannsee once owned by the German-Jewish banker Hans Arnhold. It {{is now one of the}} most important links between Germany and the United States. Its Fellows have included writers (including Pulitzer Prize winning authors Arthur Miller and Jeffrey Eugenides), economists, government officials, and public policy experts such as <b>Dennis</b> <b>Ross</b> and former U.S. Ambassador to The Peoples Republic of China, J.

2500|$|<b>Dennis</b> <b>Ross,</b> the US Middle East envoy {{and a key}} {{negotiator}} at the summit, summarized his {{perspectives in}} his book The Missing Peace. During a lecture in Australia, Ross suggested {{that the reason for}} the failure was Arafat's unwillingness to sign a final deal with Israel that would close the door on any of the Palestinians' maximum demands, particularly the right of return. Ross claimed that what Arafat really wanted was [...] "a one-state solution. Not independent, adjacent Israeli and Palestinian states, but a single Arab state encompassing all of Historic Palestine". Ross also quoted Saudi Prince Bandar as saying while negotiations were taking place: [...] "If Arafat does not accept what is available now, it won't be a tragedy; it will be a crime." ...|$|E

Responding to a question posed by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, Ross stated that Carter was also [...] "wrong" [...] to suggest that Israel had rejected the American proposals at Camp David: [...] "his is a matter of record. This is not a matter of interpretation." [...] Ross concluded: [...] "President Carter made a major contribution to peace in the Middle East. That's the reality. I would like him to meet the same standard that he applied then to what he's doing now." ...|$|E

Robert Satloff, {{executive director of}} the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), defended Ross and criticized Walt, in a piece published by Foreign Affairs (which had published Walt's piece a few days earlier). Satloff wrote that Ross's connection to WINEP is innocuous (Ross was a distinguished fellow at WINEP throughout George W. Bush's administration, and Mearsheimer and Walt's book described WINEP as [...] "part of the core" [...] of the Israel lobby in the United States) and that Walt mistakenly believes the U.S. cannot simultaneously [...] "advance strategic partnership both with Israel and with friendly Arab and Muslim states" ...|$|R

2500|$|During United States–brokered {{negotiations}} in 1999–2000, Israel and Syria discussed {{a peace deal}} that would include Israeli withdrawal {{in return for a}} comprehensive peace structure, recognition and full normalization of relations. The disagreement {{in the final stages of}} the talks was on access to the Sea of Galilee. Israel offered to withdraw to the pre-1948 border (the 1923 Paulet-Newcombe line), while Syria insisted on the 1967 frontier. The former line has never been recognised by Syria, claiming it was imposed by the colonial powers, while the latter was rejected by Israel as the result of Syrian aggression. The difference between the lines is less than 100m for the most part, but the 1967 line would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee, and Israel wished to retain control of the Sea of Galilee, its only freshwater lake and a major water resource. <b>Dennis</b> <b>Ross,</b> Clinton's chief Middle East negotiator, blamed [...] "cold feet" [...] on the part of Barak for the breakdown.
