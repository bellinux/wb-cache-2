5|$|Hassett was rested as Australia amassed 456 and {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings {{immediately after the}} Fourth Test. He then led the team {{in place of the}} resting Bradman in the next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings. The hosts fell for 197 and Hassett was unbeaten on 71 as Australia reached 3/215having featured in a partnership of 126 with Millerwhen the weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{was then}} rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second}} time on the tour.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fourth Test, Bradman scored 62, before being bowled {{attempting}} a pull shot to a ball that kept low, as Australia compiled 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. Bradman rested {{himself in the}} next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings. He then scored 31 and 13 not out, bowled by Eric Hollies as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer and earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he famously dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck. Australia proceeded to face and draw with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Bradman made 28 after being dropped twice in Australia's 321, before taking two catches as the tourists took a 191-run lead. He then came in at 1/16 and put on 161 for the second wicket with Barnes, and was unbeaten on 133 when he declared at 3/265. The home side hung on for a draw at 7/199 when time ran out. Bradman then rested himself during the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> was washed out after the first day.|$|E

While in Batavia, in 1945 he began associating with Chairil Anwar's literary group Republika. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence and the start of the Indonesian National Revolution, he fled to West Java and participated in events led by the Socialist Party of Indonesia led by Sutan Sjahrir.

5|$|Barnes {{returned}} from injury after {{two and a}} half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary maiden. When Australia fielded, a point of interest for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at mid-wicket, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against Glamorgan, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to Allan Watkins, he walked off visibly showing his displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was rested as Bradman’s men {{defeated}} Warwickshire by nine wickets. He {{returned as}} the tourists faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second}} time on tour. Barnes top-scored in the first innings with 67, putting on an opening stand of 123 with Morris as Australia made 321. He continued his productivity with 90 in the second innings, adding 161 for the second-wicket with Bradman. The home side managed to hang on for a draw, seven wickets down in their second innings. Barnes was then rested for the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings. Australia made 282 and had the hosts at 5/73 in reply when rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{intelligence}} acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville {{in the town}} of Mackville. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at Perryville, but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army—not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's—engaged Maj. Gen. Alexander McCook's corps of Buell's army and began the Battle of Perryville. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested {{for the first}} of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Test, Hamence made 21 at No. 6 as Australia amassed 456 and {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Hamence {{was yet to}} bat when rain ended the match at 3/215 in Australia's first innings. He was rested as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hamence was recalled as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. He made 14 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in the second when Australia declared, having batted at No. 5 both times. In the last match before the Fifth Test, a non-first-class fixture against Durham, Hamence scored 24 batting at No. 6 in Australia's 282. The match was a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings. Hamence was overlooked for the Fifth Test, as Australia won by an innings to seal the series 40; the drawn Third Test was Australia's only non-victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Glamorgan, McCool neither batted nor bowled in a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> {{did not reach}} the second innings. In the {{following}} fixture against Warwickshire, McCool did not bowl in the first innings and scored 19, before taking 4/56 in the second innings, helping {{to set up a}} win by nine wickets. McCool was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, and came to the crease with Australia in trouble at 3/22. He top-scored with 64 to help Australia reach 282 all out. McCool took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply when rain ended the match after the first day. After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval. However, it was fellow leg spinner Ring and not McCool who was called in. Australia crushed England by an innings and 149 runs to take the series 40.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{returned}} {{in the next}} match and claimed both openers to end with 2/27 from 19 overs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 138 in their first innings. He then made a duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. Loxton bowled six overs and took 0/15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Loxton did little, scoring two in his only innings and taking a match total of 1/32, his victim being Test batsman Jack Ikin. In the non-first-class game against Durham, a rain-affected <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> did not reach the second innings, Loxton made 15 in Australia's 282 and then took 1/8 from six overs as the hosts reached 5/73 before rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E
5|$|The <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> {{determined}} the semi-final allocation {{was held on}} 17 January 2013 at the Malmö City Hall. A draw at the EBU headquarters determined that, due to their geographical proximity with Malmö, Denmark would perform in the first semi-final, while Norway would perform in the second semi-final. This provided a maximum availability of tickets for visitors from both countries. The EBU also allocated Israel to the second semi-final after a request from the delegation {{in order to avoid}} complications with a national holiday coinciding with the date of the first semifinal. The remaining participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom), were split into five pots, based on voting patterns from the previous nine years. From these pots, 15 (in addition to Denmark) were allocated to compete in the first semi-final on 14 May 2013 and 15 (in addition to Norway and Israel) were allocated to compete in the second semi-final on 16 May 2013.|$|E

5|$|The <b>draw</b> <b>that</b> {{determined}} the semi-final allocation {{was held on}} 20 January 2014 at the Copenhagen City Hall. Prior to the allocation draw, on 24 November 2013 {{it was announced that}} Norway and Sweden would perform in different semi-finals in order to maximise the availability of tickets for visitors from both countries. A draw at the EBU headquarters determined that Sweden would perform in the first semi-final, while Norway would perform in the second semi-final. The EBU also allocated Israel to the second semi-final after a request from the delegation in order to avoid complications with a national holiday coinciding with the date of the first semi-final.

From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
