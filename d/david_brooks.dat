5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor <b>David</b> <b>Brooks,</b> and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of <b>David</b> <b>Brooks,</b> the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E

Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
