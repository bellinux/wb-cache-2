The impact and effectiveness of our data assimilation system is assessed in two steps: firstly, {{through the use of}} synthetic data (i. e. model-generated data), and secondly, through the assimilation of real satellite <b>data.</b> While ice <b>concentrations</b> are available daily, freeboard data used in this study are only available during six one-month periods spread over 2005 - 2007.

Using real ice <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> enhances the model realism in both hemispheres. Assimilation of ice <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> significantly improves the total hemispheric sea-ice extent all year long, especially in summer. Combining the assimilation of ice freeboard and <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> leads to better ice thickness, but does not further improve the ice extent.
