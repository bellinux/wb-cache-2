In experiments, when the PSA link is operated in a highly nonlinear regime, a 1. 4 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) improvement is achieved compared to a one-span optimized <b>dispersion</b> <b>map</b> link due to improved nonlinearity mitigation.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the transmission of 40 Gbits/s return-to-zero differential phase-shift keying (RZ-DPSK) signals is robust to lumped <b>dispersion</b> <b>mapping</b> on a typical installed terrestrial single-mode fiber/dispersion compensating fiber (SMF-DCF) link and will withstand, in this case, propagation through over 800 km of SMF with zero in-line group-velocity dispersion compensation while maintaining similar performance to configurations with periodic mapping.

40|$|Abstract—It has {{previously}} been shown that dispersion compen-sation can dramatically affect the interchannel crosstalk in a mul-tichannel analog fiber transmission link. In this work, we use a genetic algorithm to find five-segment <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> that yield low crosstalk levels over two octaves of microwave-frequency band-width when amplitude modulation is used. The genetic algorithm suggests that optimal <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> have low residual disper-sion. Despite the genetic algorithm’s ability to optimize <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> with many fibers, {{it is possible to}} obtain similar crosstalk levels from a simpler two-segment design whose dispersion is fully compensated.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In recent years, {{there have}} been {{increasing}} research efforts aimed towards understanding dispersion-managed communications systems. As a result, both experimental 1; 2 and computational 3; 4 results have suggested {{the possibility of using}} return-to-zero (RZ) pulses in periodic <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> where the average dispersion is in the anomalous (soliton) regime. A fundamental motivation for the <b>dispersion</b> <b>mapping</b> technique arises from the need to significantly suppress the phase-matched fourwave mixing processes which leads to substantial performance penalties in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. By allowing for large local dispersion, the efficiency of the four-wave mixing process can be substantially reduced 5; 6. Although the four-wave mixing penalty is decreased, dispersion management imposes a strong perturbation to the nonlinear pulse propagation in the fiber...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we carry}} out, by {{numerical}} simulations and experiments on recirculating loop, a comparative {{analysis of the}} performances of two types of dispersion management techniques for 160 Gb/s transmission systems, which correspond to short-period <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> (dense <b>dispersion</b> management) and long-period <b>dispersion</b> <b>maps</b> (conventional <b>dispersion</b> management), respectively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} transmission links amplified by phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs). Using an analytic description we explain the principles enabling improved sensitivity compared to conventional links amplified by phase-insensitive amplifiers (PIAs) and mitigation of nonlinear transmission distortions. We demonstrate these features using numerical simulations and in particular we show the possibility of efficiently mitigating both self-phase modulation (SPM) induced distortions and nonlinear phase noise (NLPN) if the link <b>dispersion</b> <b>map</b> is optimized. The properties of the noise on signal and idler are important and to enable NLPN mitigation the noise must be correlated at the link input. We investigate {{the role of the}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>map</b> in detail and show that in a link with standard single mode fiber (SSMF) the optimum <b>dispersion</b> <b>map</b> for efficient nonlinearity mitigation corresponds to pre-compensation of an amount equal to the effective loss length. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate both improved sensitivity and mitigation of nonlinearities in a 105 km PSA-amplified link transmitting 10 GBd 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM) data.
