500|$|Construction {{started on}} August 13, 1963, with an {{elaborate}} ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges {{anchored in the}} St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> to dump the first batch of fill to enlarge Saint Helen's Island, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% {{was coming from the}} Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal. The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) {{to reduce the amount of}} fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of Notre Dame Island and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cité du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the critical path method (CPM). [...] On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.|$|E
2500|$|Farmers in Wainfleet dumped milk {{since it}} could not be transported out, and they also had trouble getting feed to their animals. The snow was {{difficult}} to plow; one road, near the lakeshore, could not be opened with a big <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> or a large bulldozer; instead, a small bulldozer with a bucket took 2.5days to clear about [...] of road. One resident noted they were snowed in for 19days before being plowed out on February 14. One effect of the prolonged confinement at home many people experienced in the fall of that year was a marked increase in births at local hospitals (almost 18% in Regional Niagara in Canada).|$|E

5000|$|Tunnel {{conveyors}} can be fed by {{a continuous}} slot hopper or bunker beneath the stockpile to reclaim material. <b>Front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> and bulldozers {{can be used}} to push the coal into feeders. Sometimes <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> are the only means of reclaiming coal from the stockpile. This has a low up-front capital cost, but much higher operating costs, measured in dollars per tonne handled. High-capacity stockpiles are commonly reclaimed using bucket-wheel reclaimers. These can achieve very high rates ...|$|R

2500|$|When he {{returned}} to the camp he and Patterson aborted their plan to remain looking for more evidence and departed for home, fearing the rain would wash out their exit. After attempting to go out along [...] "the low road"—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby <b>front-end</b> <b>loader.</b> The drive home from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed logging road, and then about 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40mph average speed.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the city}} {{significantly}} expanded both in population and size. A number of prominent plants and factories were established or moved from eastern {{parts of the}} USSR. This resulted in partial Russification {{of the city and}} some loss of its western flavour. Among the most notable plants were the bus factory (Lvivsky Avtomobilny Zavod), which produced most of the buses in the Soviet Union and employed upwards of 30,000, TV factory [...] "Zavod Elektron" [...] which made {{one of the most popular}} brand of television sets in the country, the <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> factory (Zavod Avto-Pogruzchik), the shoe factory (Obuvnaya Fabrika Progress), [...] confectionery Svitoch, and many more. Each of these employed tens of thousands of workers and were among the largest employers in the region. Most of them survive to this day, although economic difficulties put a drain on their production figures.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Williams, of Williams Brothers Asphalt Paving Co. of Ionia, Michigan {{provided}} the Club with a surety bond, a dump truck, a <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> and a bulldozer plus operators {{to run the}} equipment which was used to build the grade. [...] Club members then tore up the track next to the engine and laid it down behind the engine. [...] The engine was then rolled down the tracks. [...] Chuck Julian, Dave Jones, an equipment operator from Williams Brothers, Dick Grieves, {{and a group of}} Hmong refugees who volunteered their time, then spent the next three days with the Williams Brothers equipment restoring the site, including casting a new concrete sidewalk. [...] Williams Brothers sent a grader from Ionia to fine grade the site after they were done with the bulk cleanup, including loading debris into the dump truck and rails onto a flatbed and hauling all of it to Ionia.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{types of}} bales are {{commonly}} used for alfalfa. For small animals and individual horses, the alfalfa is baled into small, two-string bales, commonly named by the strands of string used to wrap it. Other bale sizes are three-string, and so on up to half-ton (six-string) [...] "square" [...] bales – actually rectangular, and typically about 40 x 45 x 100cm (14 x 18 x 38 in). Small square bales weigh from [...] depending on moisture, and can be easily hand separated into [...] "flakes". Cattle ranches use large round bales, typically [...] in diameter and weighing from [...] These bales can be placed in stable stacks or in large feeders for herds of horses or unrolled {{on the ground for}} large herds of cattle. The bales can be loaded and stacked with a tractor using a spike, known as a bale spear, that pierces the center of the bale, or they can be handled with a grapple (claw) on the tractor's <b>front-end</b> <b>loader.</b> A more recent innovation is large [...] "square" [...] bales, roughly the same proportions as the small squares, but much larger. The bale size was set so stacks would fit perfectly on a large flatbed truck. These are more common in the western United States.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders,</b> {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|R
50|$|Bulk {{materials}} such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or screw conveyors, bucket elevators and mobile equipment such as <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders.</b> Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts.

40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of harvesting operations in New Zealand. A representative sample of 142 landings were measured using GPS; twelve recently constructed and unused, 38 live and the remaining 92 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m 2, with a range from 1370 to 12540 m 2. On average 11 log sorts were cut, the landings in use for 4 weeks, and estimated daily production was 287 m 3 /day. Log processing was mechanised on 53 % of the landings and 47 % was manual processing, and most (79 %) of the operations used tracked grapple loaders (21 % used <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders).</b> A regression equation to model landing size indicated that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main factors that determine landing size. Landing size tended to increase over time, with used landings on average being 900 m 2 larger than newly constructed (unused) landings. Most recently constructed landings were much larger than the company design specifications; whereby either 40 x 60 m or 40 x 80 m were common specifications. A comparable study in 1987 showed the average landing to be just over 1900 m 2, indicating landing size has nearly doubled in the last 20 years. Landings serviced by <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> were on average 1100 m 2 larger than those serviced by tracked grapple loader, but this result is partially explained by the fact that <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> were more commonly used in high production systems...|$|R
