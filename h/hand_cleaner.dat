50|$|GOJO {{was founded}} in 1946 in Akron, Ohio, by Goldie and Jerry Lippman. Goldie worked at the Miller Tire Co. rubber factory during World War II where graphite, tar, and carbon often got on her hands, {{as well as the}} hands of other employees, and was {{difficult}} to remove. Jerry worked at the Goodyear Aircraft plant. Both came home covered in sticky black carbon. They disliked what the cleaners used to clean their clothes so they set out to find an effective cleaning product that could be used without water. Goldie and Jerry worked together with Professor Clarence Cook from Kent State University’s chemistry department to formulate a heavy duty <b>hand</b> <b>cleaner.</b> They called it GOJO <b>Hand</b> <b>Cleaner</b> and sold it to rubber workers. Prior to their product, chemicals such as benzene were used to remove soils, but these irritated the skin. After the war they began marketing to automotive service facilities. They quit their factory jobs and started GOJO.|$|E

Many home {{remedies}} and commercial products (e.g., Tecnu, Zanfel) also claim to prevent urushiol rashes after exposure. A study that compared Tecnu ($1.25/oz.) with Goop <b>Hand</b> <b>Cleaner</b> or Dial Ultra Dishwashing Soap ($0.07/oz.) found that differences among the three—in the range of 56-70% improvement over no treatment—were nonsignificant (P > 0.05), but that improvement over no treatment was significant at the same level of confidence.|$|E
50|$|Trackers' {{quarters}} {{are located}} in the eastern corner of the block and are a small two room weatherboard hut. Aboriginal trackers were retained by the police force to assist with the capture of errant prisoners and recalcitrants. They were also used to find lost children and were highly prized for their bushcraft skills. In addition to such duties, aboriginal trackers also acted as subordinate staff, attending to such jobs as stable <b>hand,</b> <b>cleaner</b> and handy man. The location and size of the hut are indicative of the hierarchy in police accommodation, with aboriginal peoples on the lowest position, in the smallest building with the least amenities. The trackers' quarters is more akin to the cell blocks than to the accommodation for constables and inspectors.|$|E

His father died when Graham was 2, and he spent his childhood moving from one relative's home to another. One of his relatives ran a tavern where Graham was put to work and his experience with drunkenness there led him to hate alcohol his whole life and forswear drinking, which made him an oddball among his peers at the time. He was often sick, and missed a great deal of schooling. He worked as a farm <b>hand,</b> <b>cleaner,</b> and teacher before deciding on the ministry as an antidote for his poor health. He entered Amherst Academy in his late twenties to become a minister as his father and grandfather had been, but was forced to leave when his schoolmates created a scandal by claiming he had improperly approached a woman.

40|$|Previous {{observational}} {{studies have}} reported protective effects of hand-washing in reducing upper respiratory infections, {{little is known about}} the associations between hand-washing and good hygienic habits and seasonal influenza infection. We conducted a case-control study to test whether the risk of influenza transmission associated with self-reported hand-washing and unhealthy hygienic habits among residents in Fujian Province, southeastern China. Laboratory confirmed seasonal influenza cases were consecutively included in the study as case-patients (n 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60100). For each case, we selected 1 control person matched for age and city of residence. Telephone interview was used to collect information on hand-washing and hygienic habits. The associations were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Compared with the poorest hand-washing score of 0 to 3, odds ratios of influenza infection decreased progressively from 0. 26 to 0. 029 as hand-washing score increased from 4 to the maximum of 9 (P 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 600. 001). Compared with the poorest hygienic habit score of 0 to 2, odds ratios of influenza infection decreased from 0. 10 to 0. 015 with improving score of hygienic habits (P 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 600. 001). Independent protective factors against influenza infection included good hygienic habits, higher hand-washing score, providing soap or <b>hand</b> <b>cleaner</b> beside the hand-washing basin, and receiving influenza vaccine. Regular hand-washing and good hygienic habits were associated with a reduced risk of influenza infection. These findings support the general recommendation for nonpharmaceutical interventions against influenza. 26986125 PMC 483990...|$|E

30|$|Microplastic {{particles}} {{are used as}} exfoliants in certain product segments of specific personal care products, such as <b>hand</b> <b>cleaners,</b> facial cleaners and toothpaste [51]. In the US patent for skin cleaners containing plastic microparticles, polyolefin particles with a size of 74 – 420  µm and an amorphous shape without sharp edges were described as appropriate for use as exfoliants [52]. The used polyolefins include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS; for abbreviations for the plastic resins see also Table  1). Gouin et al. [53] estimated that in 2012, approx. 6  % of the liquid skin cleaning products marketed in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland contained microplastics. Based on a survey conducted by Cosmetics Europe, PE accounted for 93  % of the microplastics used in skin cleaning products in these countries in 2012. The products typically contained between 0.05 and 12  % of microplastic particles, {{with the size of}} most particles ranging from 450 to 800  µm [53]. When analysing skin cleaners, spherical particles (mostly with a rough surface), threads and irregularly shaped particles consisting of PE and PS, and mainly having a blue or white colour were identified [45, 51, 54 – 56]. Microplastics are also used in medical applications, e.g. in dentist tooth polish, and as carriers to deliver active pharmaceutical agents [51, 57]. After use, microplastics from personal care products and such medical products can reach the environment via wastewater.|$|R

40|$|Birds that remove ectoparasites {{and other}} food {{material}} from their hosts are iconic illustrations of mutualistic– commensalistic cleaning associations. To assess the complex pattern of food resource use embedded in cleaning interactions of {{an assemblage of}} birds and their herbivorous mammal hosts in open habitats in Brazil, we used a network approach that characterized their patterns of association. Cleaning interactions showed a distinctly nested pattern, related {{to the number of}} interactions of cleaners and hosts and to the range of food types that each host species provided. Hosts that provided a wide range of food types (ﬂies, ticks, tissue and blood, and organic debris) were attended by more species of cleaners and formed the core of the web. On the other <b>hand,</b> core <b>cleaner</b> species did not exploit the full range of available food resources, but used a variety of host species to exploit these resources instead. The structure that we found indicates that cleaners rely on cleaning interactions to obtain food types that would not be available otherwise (e. g., blood-engorged ticks or horseﬂies, wounded tissue). Additionally, a nested organization for the cleaner bird–mammalian herbivore association means that both generalist and selective species take part in the interactions and that partners of selective species form an ordered subset of the partners of generalist species. The availability of predictable protein-rich food sources for birds provided by cleaning interactions may lead to an evolutionary pathway favoring their increased use by birds that forage opportunisticallyPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{knowledge}} gaps when estimating aerosol forcing {{and their}} role in air quality is our limited understanding of their vertical distribution. As an active lidar in space, the CALIOP-CALIPSO is helping to close this gap. The descending orbital track of CALIPSO follows elongated semi-major axis of Sweden, slicing its atmosphere every 2 - 3 d, thus providing {{a unique opportunity to}} characterise aerosols and their verticality in all seasons irrespective of solar conditions. This favourable orbital configuration of CALIPSO over Sweden is exploited in the present study. Using five years of night-time aerosol observations (2006 - 2011), we investigated the vertical distribution of aerosols. The role of temperature inversions and winds in governing this distribution is additionally investigated using collocated AIRS-Aqua and ERA-Interim Reanalysis data. It is found that the majority of aerosols (up to 70 %) are located within 1 km above the surface in the lowermost troposphere, irrespective of the season. In summer, convection and stronger mixing lift aerosols to slightly higher levels, but their noticeable presence in the upper free troposphere is observed in the winter half of the year, when the boundary layer is decoupled due to strong temperature inversions separating local sources from the transport component. When southerly winds prevail, two or more aerosol layers are most frequent over southern Sweden and the polluted air masses have higher AOD values. The depolarisation ratio and integrated attenuated backscatter of these aerosol layers are also higher. About 30 - 50 % of all aerosol layers are located below the level where temperature inversions peak. On the other <b>hand,</b> relatively <b>cleaner</b> conditions are observed when the winds have a northerly component...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{cleaners}} {{are known}} to experience considerable musculoskeletal problems due to the static muscular work {{that have to be}} maintained throughout their working period as well as those due to highly repetitive movements of the arms and hands. About 80 % of the cleaning job is done with the manual cleaning tool. In this study, staircase cleaning was studied and analyzed with special focus on muscular load differences resulting from using an easily adjustable as opposed to a non-adjustable mop stick. Thirteen professional cleaners participated in this study. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded from six muscle groups (left and right wrist extensor, right and left middle deltoid and right and left upper trapezius) while cleaners performed the staircase cleaning task at their normal pace for about five minutes using the easily adjustable and the non adjustable mop stick in random order. At the end of each test the cleaners rated their perceived exertion on the Borg scale (0 - 10) for {{the upper part of the}} body. The results showed significantly higher mean sEMG activity recorded from the right middle deltoid and right upper trapezius while using the non-adjustable stick as compared to the easily adjustable stick (p< 0. 05). sEMG activity from the left middle deltoid and left upper trapezius showed no significant difference as all participating <b>cleaners</b> were right <b>handed.</b> The <b>cleaners</b> rated less exertion in the upper body parts while using the adjustable mop stick compared to the non-adjustable mop stick.

60|$|The {{desire to}} insure the {{efficiency}} of the young men selected, has not been the only object--perhaps not the chief object--of those who have yielded in this matter to the arguments of the reformers. There had arisen in England a system of patronage, under which it had become gradually necessary for politicians to use their influence for the purchase of political support. A member of the House of Commons, holding office, who might chance to have five clerkships to give away in a year, found himself compelled to distribute them among those who sent him to the House. In this there was nothing pleasant to the distributer of patronage. Do away with the system altogether, and he would have as much chance of support as another. He bartered his patronage only because another did so also. The beggings, the refusings, the jealousies, the correspondence, were simply troublesome. Gentlemen in office were not therefore indisposed to rid themselves of the care of patronage.

60|$|The reader {{must bear}} in mind that I am now telling the story of Catiline, and going back to a period of two years before Cicero's Consulship, which was B.C. 63. How during that year Cicero {{successfully}} defended Murena when Cato endeavored to rob him of his coming Consulship, has been already told. It may be that Murena's <b>hands</b> were no <b>cleaner</b> than those of Sulla and Autronius, and that they lacked only the consular authority and forensic eloquence of the advocate who defended Murena. At this time, when the two appointed Consuls were rejected, Cicero had hardly as yet taken any part in public politics. He had been Quæstor, Ædile, and Prætor, filling those administrative offices to the best of his ability. He had, he says, hardly heard of the first conspiracy.[189] That what he says is true, is, I think, proved by the absence of all allusion to it in his early letters, or in the speeches or fragments of speeches that are extant. But that there was such a conspiracy we cannot doubt, nor that the three men named, Catiline, Sulla, and Autronius, were leaders in it. What would interest us, if only we could have the truth, is whether Cæsar and Crassus were joined in it.|$|R
