50|$|Emissions from fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> {{water heaters}} are {{expelled}} {{using a variety}} of venting technologies. Atmospheric vented systems use room air as combustion air and exhaust air. The exhaust air is expelled through the exhaust flue by buoyancy forces resulting from the combustion. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric vent systems, but an exhaust fan is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct vent systems do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|E
50|$|A {{reducing}} atmosphere {{is also used}} to produce specific effects on ceramic wares being fired. A reduction atmosphere is produced in a <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> kiln by reducing the draft and depriving the kiln of oxygen. This diminished level of oxygen causes incomplete combustion of the fuel and raises the level of carbon inside the kiln. At high temperatures the carbon will bond with and remove the oxygen in the metal oxides used as colorants in the glazes. This loss of oxygen results in a change in the color of the glazes because it allows the metals in the glaze to be seen in an unoxidized form. A reduction atmosphere can also affect the color of the clay body. If iron is present in the clay body, as it is in most stoneware, then it will be affected by the reduction atmosphere as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{source term}} {{literature}} was reviewed to estimate aerosolized and respirable release fractions for accidents involving plutonium in high-explosive (HE) detonation and in <b>fuel</b> <b>fires.</b> For HE detonation, all estimates {{are based on}} the total amount of Pu. For <b>fuel</b> <b>fires,</b> all estimates {{are based on the}} amount of Pu oxidized. I based my estimates for HE detonation primarily upon the results from the Roller Coaster experiment. For hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> oxidation of plutonium, I based lower bound values on laboratory experiments which represent accident scenarios with very little turbulence and updraft of a fire. Expected values for aerosolization were obtained from the Vixen A field tests, which represent a realistic case for modest turbulence and updraft, and for respirable fractions from some laboratory experiments involving large samples of Pu. Upper bound estimates for credible accidents are based on experiments involving combustion of molten plutonium droplets. In May of 1991 the DOE Pilot Safety Study Program established a group of experts to estimate the fractions of plutonium which would be aerosolized and respirable for certain nuclear weapon accident scenarios...|$|R

40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid <b>Fuel</b> or External <b>Fire,</b> Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of <b>Fuel</b> <b>Fire</b> Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, up to 24 burners can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two lines of burners per side have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Efficiency {{enhancement}} in a {{low grade}} <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> power plant {{is one of the}} challenging tasks for researchers. In a low grade <b>fuel</b> <b>fired</b> power plant even a fraction of a percentage improvement in efficiency implies a huge savings in annual fuel costs. Mainly, the poor vapor quality of steam in the last stages of an LP turbine and energy loss in the condenser deteriorates the Rankine steam cycle performance. Reducing the amount of energy loss in the condenser and minimizing two-phase fluid operation in last stages of the LP turbine can substantially improve the cycle efficiency. The objective is to reduce the energy losses and to enhance the system performance. In this work a direct-fired 82. 2 MWfuel biomass fueled condensing power Rankine cycle is considered for performance improvement. Energy and exergy analysis are performed for the proposed Rankine-Kalina combined cycle (RKC). The RKC cycle produces higher power output and is more efficient than a Rankine steam cycle...|$|E
