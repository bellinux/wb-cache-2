25|$|In a {{test drive}} of the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni, the test <b>driver</b> <b>bearing</b> {{the name of}} the car said he was against E-gear because it takes some amount of vehicle control away from the driver, and all-wheel drive Lamborghinis from the beginning, and the company was divided over AWD cars. In that review, a LP550-2 with E-Gear was tested.|$|E
5000|$|At standstill, {{or while}} on standby, pump and <b>driver</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{preserved}} by the surrounding oil mist, which {{exists in the}} bearing housing space at a pressure just barely higher than ambient. These pump and <b>driver</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated from the time when atomized oil globules join (or wet out) to become larger oil droplets. This joining-into-large-droplets starts whenever the equipment shafts rotate, which is when small globules {{come into contact with}} each other and start coating the bearing elements.|$|R

50|$|An all new chassis {{with four}} speed gearbox, freewheel, {{automatic}} restart, bigger brakes, automatic clutch spiral bevel final drive {{and other facilities}} for the <b>driver</b> but <b>bearing</b> the same Pressed Steel body and, for the moment, the same engine was announced in July 1932. It was sold alongside the Family Ten for a 17 per cent premium.|$|R
50|$|Two L-2 {{locomotives}} {{were given}} modifications for dual service work; higher boiler pressure, smaller cylinders, light-weight reciprocating parts, dynamic counterbalancing of the <b>drivers,</b> roller <b>bearings</b> on all axles, etc. The {{success of these}} modifications prompted {{the construction of the}} L-3 class in 1940, 25 of which were built for dual service and the remaining 40 for freight only.|$|R
5000|$|A [...]25-caliber Colt pistol, O-type blood (Webb's blood type) and a New Jersey <b>driver's</b> license <b>bearing</b> an alias used by Webb, Stanley John Portas, a name of Webb's wife's {{deceased}} husband, {{were among}} the evidence found at the murder scene. Portas had been dead since 1948. Webb {{is believed to have}} been in Saxonburg for a planned burglary of a jewelry store. Adams' revolver was later found approximately 7 mi away along Cornplanter Road in Winfield, Pennsylvania. All six bullets of the weapon had been fired.|$|R

[...] Dean stated that she visited the school to read about Worthington in the college newspaper, a public record. She also stated she did not ask for non-public records and that upon the request of the college showed her California <b>Driver</b> License <b>bearing</b> her full name and address. There is no record that she used any material from the college newspaper.|$|R

40|$|Researchers at Uppsala University are {{developing}} a flywheel energy storage device intended {{to be used in}} electrical vehicles. Kinetic energy storage technology has potential to make purely electric powertrain both more effective and efficient. While deployment of the third prototype is approaching there has been a request for a more precise and noise-immune circuitry to power active magnetic bearings that hold and stabilise the rotor. A similar circuit designed for powering electromagnets was recently developed at the Uppsala University’s Electricity department and is used as a template in development of the new active magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>driver</b> circuit. Current measurement integration technique is tested and implemented as a way to increase circuit’s control feedback loop performance. To further boost precision and noise-immunity 0 - 20 mA current loop signals are adapted as the standard for output signals. Results of this project include a thorough analysis of the electromagnet driver circuit development, implementation of a new current sensing technique including an experimental self-inductance measurement, printed circuit board layout design and a full list of components necessary to power and control two sets of active magnetic bearings consisting of 8 individual electromagnets. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{the primary}} roles {{of women in}} {{conscription}} was in the recruiting and campaigns. They would often be on posters or in the posts. They would be positioned during this time as vulnerable, perhaps with children, and be made out to be weak, and therefore in need of protection. One quote from one photos even recounts, 'Any right—minded woman would rather be a mother or sister of a dead hero than of a living shirker.' Women during World War I were also a huge pacifist movement often going through great deals to hold out for peace. Once again, they portrayed themselves as wives, sisters, sweethearts or mothers. Women often did less dangerous jobs {{that needed to be}} done for instance visiting and healing wounded soldiers. Often, they would hold small or confectionery sales, such as sold buttons on button days, rattled collection boxes on collection days, organised fetes, baked cakes, put together 'comfort parcels' and, above all they knitted. Quite a few women looked to take a greater part in the more war related activities. This included cooking, stretcher <b>bearing,</b> <b>drivers,</b> interpreters and munitions workers. However the government did not allow it.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{sequence}} of engine failures in their works cars the Brabham team started the 1963 Formula One season with a Lotus 25, borrowed from Team Lotus, alongside their one running MRD design, when the team expanded into a two car operation {{with the addition of}} American driver Dan Gurney. The BT3 was replaced for the 1963 Championship season by new Brabham BT7s, although Brabham himself used BT3 for the Championship Belgian and Italian Grands Prix that year when a BT7 chassis was not available. Brabham used BT3 more regularly in non-Championship events, winning both the 1963 Solitude Grand Prix and 1963 Austrian Grand Prix; the first race victories for his eponymous team's own cars, and again the first ever for a <b>driver</b> and car <b>bearing</b> the same name. In the latter, Brabham and the BT3 finished a full five laps ahead of second-placed Tony Settember in his Scirocco-BRM, proving the Brabham's strength and reliability as various Lotus and Cooper challengers succumbed to the Zeltweg Airfield track's rough surface. Between these two victories Brabham loaned the BT3 to his young mechanic and Formula Junior driver, and future Formula One World Champion, Denny Hulme, who took it to fourth place in the 1963 Kanonloppet in Sweden.|$|R
