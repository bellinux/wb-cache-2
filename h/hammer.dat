5|$|Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful, its {{box office}} {{performance}} was eclipsed by the massive success of another <b>Hammer</b> film, The Curse of Frankenstein, {{which was to}} be the first of their many Gothic horror films. As a result it would be ten years before <b>Hammer</b> adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967. Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which <b>Hammer</b> pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent <b>Hammer</b> productions.|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide range}} of body <b>hammers</b> are used in metalworking. <b>Hammers</b> range from small, {{lightweight}} [...] "pick" [...] <b>hammers</b> (that provide stubby pick point and high-crown peen-type faces that will ding out small dents in high fins), to specialty <b>hammers</b> and heavy-duty [...] "bumping" [...] <b>hammers</b> for heavy gauge truck fenders and panels.

A drill bit is coupled to the drive shaft for drilling {{by a combination of}} sonic <b>hammering</b> and rotation. The drill bit includes a fluted shaft leading to a distal crown cutter with teeth.

5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. <b>Hammer</b> explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that <b>Hammer</b> make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to <b>Hammer</b> what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

40|$|We {{explored}} {{variation in}} patterns of percussive stone-tool use on coastal foods by Burmese long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis aurea) from two islands in Laem Son National Park, Ranong, Thailand. We catalogued variation into three <b>hammering</b> classes and 17 ac-tion patterns, after examining 638 tool-use bouts across 90 individuals. <b>Hammering</b> class {{was based on the}} stone surface used for striking food, being face, point, and edge hammer-ing. Action patterns were discriminated by tool material, hand use, posture, and striking mo-tion. <b>Hammering</b> class was analyzed for associations with material and behavioural elements of tool use. Action patterns were not, owing to insufficient instances of most pat-terns. We collected 3077 scan samples from 109 macaques on Piak Nam Yai Island’s coasts, to determine the proportion of individuals using each <b>hammering</b> class and action pattern. Point <b>hammering</b> was significantly more associated with sessile foods, smaller tools, faster striking rates, smoother recoil, unimanual use, and more varied striking direc-tion, than were face and edge <b>hammering,</b> while both point and edge <b>hammering</b> were sig-nificantly more associated with precision gripping than face <b>hammering.</b> Edge hammerin...|$|R
