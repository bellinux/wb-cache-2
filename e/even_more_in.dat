5|$|The lavishness of the {{architecture}} that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy. This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron.|$|E
5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked {{enough troops}} to oppose Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his control over his native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> his message to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, but added a few conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|The B-70, {{designed}} for even higher speeds, altitudes and range than the B-58, suffered <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> relative terms. At high altitudes, the B-70 {{was as much}} as four {{times as fast as}} the B-52, but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach0.95, only modestly faster than the B-52 at the same altitudes. It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long journey from the USA to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF's doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only {{a short period of time}} between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.|$|E

Oesch was condemned to twelve years of penal servitude by a Finnish military court on 19 July 1946, although the sentence was commuted to three years by the highest court on 2 February 1948.

25|$|Though UVA is the {{flagship}} university of Virginia, state funding has decreased for several consecutive decades.

The portion of academic revenue coming from the state fell by <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the same period, from 22 percent to just nine percent. This nominal support from the state, contributing just $154 million of UVA's $2.6 billion budget in 2012-13, has led President Sullivan and others to contemplate the partial privatization of the University of Virginia. UVA's Darden School and Law School are already self-sufficient.|$|E

25|$|Observation {{of radio}} {{propagation}} beacons operating around 28.2MHz, 50MHz and 70MHz, indicates that {{maximum observed frequency}} (MOF) for Es {{is found to be}} lurking around 30MHz on most days during the summer season, but sometimes MOF may shoot up to 100MHz or <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> ten minutes to decline slowly during the next few hours. The peak-phase includes oscillation of MOF with periodicity of approximately 5...10 minutes. The propagation range for Es single-hop is typically 1000 to 2000km, but with multi-hop, double range is observed. The signals are very strong but also with slow deep fading.|$|E
25|$|EZLN, {{commonly}} known as the Zapatistas, came to the forefront of Chiapas politics in the mid 1990s. Since then, their bases of support have mostly come from indigenous communities in the settled areas of the Lacandon Jungle and the areas around San Cristobal de las Casas. While migration to the Lacandon had been occurring earlier in the 20th century, it accelerated <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s, with the Zapatistas encouraging people to seize “unoccupied jungle.” For this reason, the Zapatistas do not have the support of the Lacandon Mayas, who have also feared for their villages’ and people’s safety when confronted by the EZLN.|$|E
25|$|Indonesian {{literature}} and poetry flourished <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half}} of the 20th century. Chairil Anwar was considered as the greatest literary figure of Indonesia by American poet and translator, Burton Raffel. He was among those youngsters who pioneered in changing the traditional Indonesian {{literature and}} modifying it on the lines of the newly independent country. Some of his popular poems include Krawang-Bekasi, Diponegoro and Aku. Other major authors include Marah Roesli (Sitti Nurbaya), Merari Siregar (Azab dan Sengsara), Abdul Muis (Salah Asuhan), Djamaluddin Adinegoro (Darah Muda), Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana (Layar Terkembang), and Amir Hamzah (Nyanyi Sunyi) whose works are among the most well known in Maritime Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|A low {{temperature}} example is work by Kitagawa, et al. {{who used a}} two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration. The result {{was one of the}} first instances of a MOF showing “superprotonic” conductivity (8 x 10−3 S/cm) at 25°C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> this {{low temperature}} regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of civil society}} organizations flourished <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s, {{due in part to}} King Hassan II’s active support for them, which reflected a worldwide trend of civil society promotion. Some have argued that the king’s support was motivated as much by international pressures and his desire to join the European Union as domestic economic and political problems. It was in this environment that calls for reform to the Mudawana first began to gain traction. All of Morocco’s major women’s organizations have positioned their work within an Islamic framework in some way, drawing on the work of Islamic scholars to inform their agendas.|$|E
25|$|In total, over 20,000 {{people have}} {{undergone}} psychosurgical {{operations in the}} United Kingdom.

Nowadays the operation is used in the treatment of depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder.
