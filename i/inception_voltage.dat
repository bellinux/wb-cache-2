Because the dielectric constant of the void is {{considerably less than}} the surrounding dielectric, the electric field across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric.

5000|$|Net {{electric}} {{charges on}} conductors, including local charge distributions associated with dipoles, reside entirely on their external surface (see Faraday cage), {{and tend to}} concentrate more around sharp points and edges than on flat surfaces. This means that the electric field generated by charges on a sharp conductive point is much stronger than the field generated by the same charge residing on a large smooth spherical conductive shell. When this electric field strength exceeds {{what is known as}} the corona discharge <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> (CIV) gradient, it ionizes the air about the tip, and a small faint purple jet of plasma can be seen in the dark on the conductive tip. Ionization of the nearby air molecules result in generation of ionized air molecules having the same polarity as that of the charged tip. Subsequently, the tip repels the like-charged ion cloud, and the ion cloud immediately expands due to the repulsion between the ions themselves. This repulsion of ions creates an electric [...] "wind" [...] that emanates from the tip, which is usually accompanied by a hissing noise due to the change in air pressure at the tip. An opposite force acts on the tip that may recoil if not tight to ground.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} fact that the {{breakdown}} voltage of an insulating liquid increases nonlinearly with increasing electrode gap. Under nonuniform field dc conditions two breakdown voltages are determined depending on the electrode polarity. Using point-plane geometries, with gaps of 5 mm of larger, one finds that typical transformer oils have higher breakdown voltages when the point is negative than when it is positive. Recently, perfluorinated polyethers {{have been found to}} produce opposite results when using average gap sizes of 5 to 10 mm. To elucidate this situation a study of the effect of gap size on breakdown voltage has been undertaken. The results show that for the polyethers at larger gaps the sequence is reversed. These observations are explained in terms of the respective streamer developments in these liquids and the relative stability of their negative ions. In the case of the conventional hydrocarbon type oils, the positive streamer usually grows slightly faster than the negative one, but the streamer <b>inception</b> <b>voltages</b> of both are rather similar. In the case of perfluorinated polyethers the positive streamers move at least 10 x faster than the negative ones, but they require much higher <b>inception</b> <b>voltages</b> than negative ones. At gaps ≳ 12 mm and the associated higher applied voltages this breakdown at negative polarity occurs at higher voltages than at the positive one. The negative ions of the perfluoro compounds are much more stable than those of conventional hydrocarbons. The discharge of the negatively charged perfluoro ions requires much higher fields than do those of conventional hydrocarbons.

40|$|AbstractCorona on {{transmission}} line conductors {{is a significant}} source of electromagnetic interference and corona loss. In order to analyze variable atmospheric condition on corona <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> gradient of bundle conductors a calculation model was established. The voltage gradient around stranded conductors for calculating corona <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> gradient is required. For the high voltage {{transmission line}}s, it is necessary to know the electric field in vicinity of the conductor's surface to determine the conditions for corona inception. The conditions under which corona discharge occurs for any arrangement of conductors are an important design consideration since corona can limit the performance of any given configuration of transmission line conductors. The AC corona <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> gradient criterion should involve the line characteristics, i. e., arrangement and size of conductors as well as atmospheric condition of the air in which the conductor is immersed. The numerical calculation method, as well as empirical equations, combined with gas discharge theory is adopted to investigate corona <b>inception</b> <b>voltage</b> gradient.

40|$|Abstract — Some {{high voltage}} lines emit {{annoying}} tonal noise {{when they are}} wet. It has been demonstrated that acoustical emissions {{have their origin in}} elec-trical discharges from deformed water drops on the lines. The use of ultra-hydrophilic coatings and thus the reduction of the population of deformable water drops on the conductors by encouraging runoff and drying can provide a significant reduction of sound emissions produced by overhead high voltage transmission lines during and after wet weather conditions; the effects are particularly pronounced after the cessation of rain. The work presented here is an electrical and optical investigation of the behav-iour of drops on different high voltage conductors showing high framing rate re-cords of their periodic deformation in the electric field. A technique to measure the drop size distributions which allows a geometric drop size classification at different times after the cessation of a rain period is proposed. It has been seen that the application of an electric field to the line yields an alteration of the drop size distribution, as drops of particular sizes may undergo resonant deformation. Discharges from the drops are also controlled by the drop geometry as drops of smaller contact angles with the substrate have higher corona <b>inception</b> <b>voltages.</b> The combination of the study of the behaviour of the drops population and of the single drops deformation should support a method to predict the tonal emis-sion from a specified high voltage transmission line.

40|$|High {{voltages}} and {{the edges}} of the metallization on ceramic substrates (AMB, DBA, DBC, HTCC, LTCC) lead to high electric field strengths. In the vicinity of the metal edges these high electric field strengths induce partial discharges in the ceramic insulation and in the covering synthetics and thereby represent one key degradation mechanism of power modules. In this work the correlation of the simulated electric field strength with phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) measurements has been investigated. For the simulation of the electric field strength a new method was used to bypass numerical artifacts. The simulated values showed {{that it is possible to}} reduce the electric field strength by an adaption of the metallization structure. There the distance of the upper and the lower metallization to the rim of the ceramic was changed relative to each other. Due to this variation a reduction of the electric field strength by about 30 % can be reached by choosing the optimum distance compared to state of the art modules. In PRPD measurements for ceramic substrates (AlN/Al 2 O 3 by DCB) we examined whether the field reduction leads to higher partial discharge <b>inception</b> <b>voltages</b> (PDIV). The measurements were executed on layouts with different dimensions of the upper and lower metallization relative to each other as well as for 3 different thicknesses of the ceramic insulation (1 mm and 0. 63 mm AlN DBC, 0. 63 mm and 0. 38 mm Al 2 O 3 DBC) layer. An increase from 20 % to 35 % of the PDIV was measured for layouts which were designed according to the findings from the simulation with respect to field strength reduction. Finally, the calculated electric field strength and the measured PDIV were correlated...|$|R
