When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later.

By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E

However, Apollo informs Veronica that <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving.

Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Danner's bodily tissues have a {{somewhat}} greater density {{than those of}} an ordinary human being.

During his stint as a sailor, he goes pearl diving with the natives of Cristobal {{and is able to}} dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.|$|E

5|$|The Condemnations at {{the medieval}} University of Paris were enacted to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris.

5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E

5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E

5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
