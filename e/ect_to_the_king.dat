40|$|Language {{laterality}} can be unequivocally ascertained {{by comparing}} the effects of unilateral <b>ECT</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{right and the left}} hemisphere. It has been shown in right-handed depressed patients that a unilateral treatment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left hemisphere resulted in transient dysphasia whereas unilateral <b>ECT</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right hemisphere did not. The language laterality in a small group of left-handed depressed patients has been ascertained. Evidence is presented to show that neither dichotic listening nor hand position for writing provide satisfactory indices of language laterality. The ear advantage was more closely related to strength of sinistrality than to language laterality [...] that is sidedness appears <b>to</b> overide brainedness. <b>The</b> results favour a spatial attention hypothesis rather than a structural hypothesis as the main determinant of laterality effects...|$|R

40|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy in}} a major {{depression}} patient with arachnoid cyst Arachnoid cyst develops when two layers of arachnoid membrane fail to unite in early fetal life causing cerebrospinal fluid accumulation and formation of a cyst. Arachnoid cysts constitute 1 % of space occupying lesions in the brain. Diagnosis is made usually with regular medical examinations. They can cause epilepsy, increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, macrocranium and growth deficit in children, and subdural hematoma. It has been recommended to be careful when administrating Electroconvulsive therapy (<b>ECT)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patients with space occupying lesions. ECT can cause adverse effects in patients with arachnoid cyst by increasing intracranial pressure. Arachnoid cyst can rupture and give symptoms by causing subdural effusion, subdural hemorrhage or intracystic hemorrhage. In this case, we diagnosed major depression and arachnoid cyst. We administered <b>ECT</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient who had suicide ideation and was resistant to pharmacotherapy. Patient’s complaints fully recovered with ECT. The size of arachnoid cyst didn’t increase and we observed no complication. In this case, we aimed <b>to</b> show that <b>ECT</b> could be successfully administered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patients with arachnoid cyst...|$|R

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis {{of animal}} cells {{requires}} ingression of the actomyosin-based contractile ring between segregated sister genomes. Localization of <b>the</b> RhoGEF <b>Ect</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central spindle at anaphase promotes local {{activation of the}} RhoA GTPase, which induces assembly and ingression of the contractile ring. Here we have used BI 2536, an inhibitor of the mitotic kinase Plk 1, <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> functions of this enzyme during late mitosis in human cells. We show that Plk 1 acts after Cdk 1 inactivation and independently from Aurora B to promote RhoA accumulation at the equator, contractile ring formation, and cleavage furrow ingression. Inhibition of Plk 1 abolishes the interaction of Ect 2 with its activator and midzone anchor, HsCyk- 4, thereby preventing localization of <b>Ect</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central spindle. We propose that late mitotic Plk 1 activity promotes recruitment of <b>Ect</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central spindle, triggering the initiation of cytokinesis and contributing to cleavage plane specification in human cells...|$|R
