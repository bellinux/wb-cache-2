50|$|Even if {{the demands}} for low {{tolerances}} of the wire and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the machine side has to follow the previously described winding design also at high winding speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at high winding speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the wire guide for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified {{by the fact that}} in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the winding of the wire on <b>delivery</b> <b>rolls</b> have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness.|$|R
25|$|A diner is a {{restaurant}} {{characterized by a}} wide range of foods, a casual and often nostalgic atmosphere, a counter, and late operating hours. The precursor to the fast food eatery began in 1872 when Walter Scott, a myopic pressman for the Providence Journal, became serious about selling food and refreshments in the streets. Scott had a plan. Instead of wearing out the soles of his shoes and roaming the streets of Providence, Rhode Island, he decided to buy a horse-drawn <b>delivery</b> van. <b>Rolling</b> on four wagon wheels, he would take his food to the people.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} different perceptions of lawlessness {{held by the}} magnate and gentry classes in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. These attitudes are analysed {{in relation to the}} coalescence of the Honour of Leicester within the Earldom of Lancaster, the acceleration of the retaining phenomenon, changes in the legal system and the accompanying rise in recorded crime.;Crime figures obtained from selected gaol <b>delivery</b> <b>rolls,</b> the Calendars of the Close and Patent Rolls, alongside evidence from the surviving eyre and assize rolls, demonstrate a rise in lawlessness between 1260 and 1360. The reasons for this increase, its perception by the population, and its portrayal in the ballads and political songs are the major themes of this thesis.;The anarchy that followed the death of Simon de Montfort, the development of the Earldom of Lancaster, the abandonment of the eyre, continuing wars, purveyance, disease, taxation, the rise of professionalism, and the practice of retaining all encouraged crime. The attitude that violence and extortion were not only acceptable, but were a means of political and social elevation is repeated in both the legal documents and literature of the day. Felons of the age, such as the Folvilles and Beltofts, are mirrored in the tales of Robin Hood, Gamelyn and Adam Bell.;Lawlessness had become an acceptable means of self-advancement for the gentry and magnate classes. Families competed for retaining alliances that brought power, influence and control of the local area; corruption was bound to follow, and consequently lawlessness. Contemporary poets could confidently place the outlaw as the hero against the tyranny of the crown, and the injustice of the law...|$|R

40|$|Cochleates, {{prospective}} nanoscale drug <b>delivery</b> vehicles, are <b>rolls</b> of {{negatively charged}} phospholipid membrane layers. The membrane layers are {{held together by}} calcium ions; however, neither the magnitude of membrane interaction forces nor the overall mechanical properties of cochleates have been known. Here, we manipulated individual nanoparticles with atomic force microscopy to characterize their nanomechanical behavior. Their stiffness (4. 2 – 12. 5 N/m) and membrane-rupture forces (45. 3 – 278 nN) are orders of magnitude greater {{than those of the}} tough viral nanoshells. Even though the fundamental building material of cochleates is a fluid membrane, the combination of supramolecular geometry, the cross-linking action of calcium, and the tight packing of the ions apparently lead to extreme mechanical resilience. The supramolecular design of cochleates may provide efficient protection for encapsulated materials and give clues to understanding biomolecular structures of similar design, such as the myelinated axon...|$|R

They used this hybrid yarn {{structure in the}} weft with varying weft densities to analyse its impacts on EMSE, moreover, they investigated different proportions of Ag/PA {{and concluded that the}} higher the % age of conductive material in blend the higher will be the EMSE. Several other researchers used somewhat similar techniques to incorporate the conductive filament in core, like, Yu et al. (2014), inserted stainless steel wire of 50  μm in core by using hollow spinning machine, the covering components were Antibacterial Nylon and Bamboo Charcoal Polyester filament. Siro core spinning system with double roving as outer layers and stainless steel core was examined for the effects of orientation of fibres within the structure by Ortlek et al. (2012). Recently, Yu et al. (2015), incorporated stainless steel wire in core using hollow spindle spinning in order to investigate the functional and EMSE of elastic warp knitted fabrics. They concluded that multi-layered fabrics with laminating angles 0 °/ 90 ° produced better results as compared to 0 °/ 0 ° layered fabrics due to the formation of metal grids in the arrangement.|$|R
40|$|All {{converting}} {{lines and}} slitter rewinding operations require an unwinding system. Typically the unwinding {{system is the}} Rodney Dangerfield on a line or slitter rewinder. The slitting system and the winding system are considered with great importance but the unwinding system does not get the respect it deserves. Although often considered a simple function, {{the selection of a}} proper unwinding system is extremely important to the overall productivity of the converting or slitting and rewinding operation. This paper is a Practical Guide for selecting the right unwind and related equipment to best match the unwinding system’s Cost verses Efficiency to ensure the maximum performance and productivity from a converting line and/or slitter rewinder. Design Criteria- The first thing that must be established is the basic design criteria. This basic design criteria will help select the design of unwind best suited for the application. The variation of these parameters dictate the flexibility required, and therefore the complexity and cost of the system. The following must be determined: 1. Materials to be processed: Types- composites, extensible, non-extensible Basis weight range Thickness range for each material and basis weight 2. Roll diameters and weights 3. Speed of operation 4. Tension- Tensile strength of materials 5. Core materials and sizes: Length variations Inside diameter and tolerances Outside diameters 6. <b>Roll</b> <b>delivery</b> systems The old rule “jack of all trades and master of none ” applies to the unwind operation so be realistic when specifying the required range for best value and performance of the unwinding system. Frame Construction – A major factor in an unwinds cost is the material and construction of the framing. The frame construction for unwind stands on typical converting lines and slitter rewinders can range from machine mounted plate steel for lower speed and light weight roll...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was motivated {{to establish a}} scientific basis for the required number of steel tie bands used in wrapping and fastening hot rolled coils produced in steel manufacture lines for safe delivery and storage. Strain gages were installed on the tie bands and stress was recorded during the banding and <b>delivery</b> procedure of <b>rolls</b> in the field. The stress developing in the bands due to fastening of the roll and that due to springback of the coil were clearly distinguishable from the strain gage signals. Twelve hot rolled coils having different yield strength, thickness, width, and weight were tested in the recoiling field. The results showed the average tensile stress developing in the bands due to the fastening of the roll to be 151. 7 ± 53. 8 MPa, which corresponded to one fourth of the failure strength of the steel band in the buckle region. In addition to the stress caused by fastening, average tensile stress caused by springback of the rolled coils {{was estimated to be}} 33 MPa. It increased to 79 MPa when one of the tie bands was removed from the roll. Comparing the measured stress due to springback with the theoretical stress formula yielded a proportional constant value of 0. 219, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 914, which demonstrate the formula to be useful in predicting springback stress. The average safety factor of the tie band was found to be 3. 26 and it decreased to 2. 60 when one of the bands was removed from the roll. The safety factor of the band was found to decrease with increased coil thickness because the current factory standard on the number of bands does not significantly take into account of increase in the springback force with increased coil thickness...|$|R
