5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the more {{striking}} of Owen's contributions {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and the even-toed (Artiodactyla), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous Cetacea. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo,</b> which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the false killer whale in 1863.|$|E

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>armadillos</b> are solitary and nocturnal, {{spending}} {{the day in}} burrows. They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball.

6000|$|Of Edentates {{there are}} four. The <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> does not range so far, and the {{delicate}} little pink fairy armadillo, the truncated Chlamydophorus, is a dweller in the sand-dunes of Mendoza, {{and has never}} colonized the grassy pampas. The Tatusia hybrida, called [...] "little mule" [...] from the length of its ears, and the Dasypus tricinctus, which, when disturbed, rolls itself into a ball, the wedge-shaped head and wedge-shaped tail admirably fitting into the deep-cut shell side by side; and the quirquincho (Dasypus minutus), all inhabit the pampa, are diurnal, and feed exclusively on insects, chiefly ants. Wherever the country becomes settled, these three disappear, owing to the dulness of their senses, especially that of sight, and to the diurnal habit, which was an advantage to them, and enabled them to survive when rapacious animals, which are mostly nocturnal, were their only enemies. The fourth, and most important, is the hairy armadillo, with habits which are in strange contrast to those of its perishing congeners, and which seem to mock many hard-and-fast rules concerning animal life. It is omnivorous, and will thrive on anything from grass to flesh, found dead and in all stages of decay, or captured by means of its own strategy. Furthermore, its habits change to suit its conditions: thus, where nocturnal carnivores are its enemies, it is diurnal; but where man appears as a chief persecutor, it becomes nocturnal. It is much hunted for its flesh, dogs being trained for the purpose; yet it actually becomes more abundant as population increases in any district; and, if versatility in habits or adaptiveness can {{be taken as a}} measure of intelligence, this poor armadillo, a survival of the past, so old on the earth as to have existed contemporaneously with the giant glyptodon, is the superior of the large-brained cats and canines.|$|E
6000|$|So we rode back, {{along the}} Cocal and along that {{wonderful}} green glade, where I, staring at Noranteas in tree-tops, instead {{of at the}} ground beneath my horse's feet, {{had the pleasure of}} being swallowed up--my horse's hindquarters at least--in the very same slough which had engulfed M---'s mule three days before, and got a roll in much soft mud. Then up to ---'s camp, where we expected breakfast, not with greediness, though we had been nigh six hours in the saddle, but with curiosity. For he had promised to send out the hunters for all game that could be found, and give us a true forest meal; and we were curious to taste what lapo, quenco, guazupita-deer, and other strange meats might be like. Nay, some of us agreed, that if the hunters had but brought in a tender young red monkey, {282a} we would surely eat him too, if it were but to say that we had done it. [...] But the hunters had had no luck. They had brought in only a Pajui, {282b} an excellent game bird; an Ant-eater, {282c} and a great Cachicame, or nine-banded Armadillo. The ant-eater the foolish fellows had eaten themselves--I would have given them what they asked for his skeleton; but the Armadillo was cut up and hashed for us, and was eaten, to the last scrap, being about the best game I ever tasted. I fear he is a foul feeder at times, who by no means confines himself to roots, or even worms. If what I was told be true, there is but too much probability for Captain Mayne Reid's statement, that he will eat his way into the soft parts of a dead horse, and stay there until he has eaten his way out again. But, to do him justice, I never heard him accused, like the <b>giant</b> <b>Armadillo</b> {282d} of the Main, of digging dead bodies out of their graves, as he is doing in a very clever drawing in Mr. Wood's Homes without Hands. Be that as it may, the Armadillo, whatever he feeds on, has the power of transmuting it into most delicate and wholesome flesh.|$|E

50|$|The {{people of}} this era were nomadic. They were {{organized}} in family-based bands of about 20 to 30 members. Their usual prey animals were called megafauna, such as <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos</b> and sloths, mastodons, etc. These became extinct about 8,000 years before the modern era.

It is thought that these first settlers of Costa Rica belonged to small nomadic groups of around 20 to 30 members bound by kinship, which moved continually to hunt animals and gather roots and wild plants.

50|$|The {{intensive}} {{hunting and}} harvesting of animals threatens endangered vertebrate species across the world. Game vertebrates are considered valuable products of tropical forests and savannas. In Brazilian Amazonia, 23 million vertebrates are killed every year; large-bodied primates, tapirs, white-lipped peccaries, <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos,</b> and tortoises {{are some of}} the animals most sensitive to harvest. Overhunting can reduce the local population of such species by more than half, as well as reducing population density. Populations located nearer to villages are significantly more at risk of depletion. Abundance of local game species declines as density of local settlements, such as villages, increases.|$|R

Despite this species’ wide range, it is locally rare. This is further exacerbated by habitat loss resulting from deforestation. Current estimates indicate the <b>giant</b> <b>armadillo</b> may have undergone a worrying population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past three decades.

Crocodylian remains were common and recovered with turtles and extinct forms of gomphothere proboscideans, horse, camel, ground sloth (Eremotherium), and pampatheres (extinct <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos,</b> Holmesina and Pampatherium).

500|$|Charles Darwin's {{publication}} of the On the Origin of Species in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had {{played a role in}} the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of <b>giant</b> <b>armadillos,</b> <b>giant</b> sloths, and what at the time he thought were giant llamas that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the {{publication of}} Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo-Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.|$|R
