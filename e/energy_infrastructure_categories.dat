40|$|The {{provision}} of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{is essential for}} economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. Understanding the multiple functions and services it provides us requires firstly {{a deeper understanding of}} the factors that influence <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> itself. This paper focusses on the factors that influence the evolution of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Nigeria. By studying different eras of energy use according to the technologies that were being implemented, resources that were available, and the political practice of the time it is possible to better frame the drivers of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The paper explores the transitions of how Nigerians managed to obtain the vast majority of energy from food calories and traditional biomass, to the broad portfolio of energy sources that is in use today...|$|R
40|$|The January 2013 {{attack on}} the In Amenas natural gas {{facility}} drew international attention. However this attack {{is part of a}} portrait of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> targeting by non-state actors that spans the globe. Data drawn from the <b>Energy</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Attack Database (EIAD) shows that in the last decade there were, on average, nearly 400 annual attacks carried out by armed non-state actors on <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> worldwide, a figure that was well under 200 prior to 1999. This data reveals a global picture whereby violent non-state actors target <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to air grievances, communicate to governments, impact state economic interests, or capture revenue in the form of hijacking, kidnapping ransoms, theft. And, for politically motivated groups, such as those engaged in insurgencies, attacking industry assets garners media coverage serving as a facilitator for international attention. This research note will introduce EIAD and position its utility within various research areas where the targeting of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> or more broadly <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> vulnerability, has been addressed, either directly or indirectly. We also provide a snapshot of the initial analysis of the data between 1980 - 2011, noting specific temporal and spatial trends, and then conclude with a brief discussion on the contribution of EIAD, highlighting future research trajectories.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Energy security, or the {{reliable}} and affordable supply of energy, {{is vital to}} the conduct of business and maintenance of quality of life in a modern economy. Achieving energy security is a complex task—involving important technical, economic, and geopolitical dimensions—and the ability to deliver energy supplies to the sources of demand for energy is a fundamental component of this task. Delivery {{is the role of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> system. A 2001 report prepared by the U. S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) includes an extensive discussion of the U. S. <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> system, asserting that, “One of the greatest energy challenges facing America is the need to use 21 st-century technology to improve America’s aging <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> ” (National <b>Energy</b> Technology Laboratory, 2001, pp. 7 - 1). The report provides a well-written and reasonably comprehensive overview of the various components of the U. S. <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> system, their interactions and interdependencies, and the needs and notable trends relevant to those components. One limitation is the scope of analysis that frames discussion of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> needs; the report’s authors chose to take expected energy demand as a given, an...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{investigating}} the linkages {{and consequences of}} the policy decision process in the governance of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Nigeria. It attempts {{to gain a better}} understanding of the role of policy makers and institutions in the provision of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Nigeria. Using a combination of semi-structured interviews and documentary evidences from published literature, this study reveals three essential areas where the policy-making processes (and therefore policy makers) intervene in the provision of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> These are: (1) granting access to historical data; (2) regulations; and (3) permitting/issuance of licenses. This study also reveals three major unintended consequences of the policy decision processes and institutions in the governance of <b>energy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> provisions in Nigeria, which are: (1) government financing corruption in the energy sector; (2) economic delusion; and (3) uncontrolled growth in energy demand driven more by export and not local internal demand...|$|R
