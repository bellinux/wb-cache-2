2500|$|R136a1 has a B-V {{index of}} about 0.03, {{which is a}} typical colour for an F-type star.

[...] The reddening (EB-V) can be used to estimate the level of visual extinction (AV). [...] EB-V values of 0.29 - 0.37 have been measured, with considerable uncertainty due to contamination from close neighbours such as R136a2 0.1" [...] away, leading to AV around 1.80 and a de-reddened B-V (B-V0) of -0.30.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} constellation, Gamma Velorum, is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum or Suhail, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.83. It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.6 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 280,000 times as luminous, [...] is around 30 times as massive and is 17 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 35,000 K. The second component is an extremely rare example of <b>hot</b> <b>star</b> known as a Wolf–Rayet star, and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 and is around 170,000 times as luminous as our sun, though it radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum. [...] Gamma1 is a blue-white star of spectral type B2III and apparent magnitude 4.3. [...] The two pairs are separated by 41 arcseconds, easily separable in binoculars. [...] Parallax measurements give a distance of 1,116 light-years, meaning that they are at least 12,000 AU apart. [...] Further afield are 7.3-magnitude Gamma Velorum C and 9.4-magnitude Gamma Velorum D, lying 62 and 93 arcseconds southsoutheast from Gamma2.|$|E
