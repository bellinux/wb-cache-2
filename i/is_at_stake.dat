5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle {{did not need to be}} complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E
5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot leave as it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes what <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game). Two masks referred to as the God and Devil Masks lie at the center of the plot, with the God Mask having powers to resurrect the dead. Gabriel intends to defeat the three factions of the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain the pieces of the God Mask and bring back his deceased wife.|$|E
40|$|This article {{tries to}} {{understand}} what might have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> for the synagogue from which the Johannine Jesus partisans had been expelled and what <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in the coinage of the term ἀποσυναγωγός. It we refuse to accept naively John’s overlexicalised and retrospective account of the grounds for expulsions {{and pay attention to}} the practices of other groups in articulating a disciplinary code, I suggest that what <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>was</b> deviant behaviour {{on the part of the}} Johannine Jesus-partisans: either failure to comply with the larger group’s practices concerning Sabbath observance, or more likely, clique formation.

50|$|The FpV, moreover, had the {{advantage}} of having relatively few Lower House seats <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in 2013. Congressmen in Argentina serve four-year terms, and gains for the various opposition parties in 2009 meant that 2013 put a disproportionate number of their Lower House seats at stake: while the FpV contested 38 of its 116 Lower House seats, a full 76 of 118 opposition seats <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> this year (a further 13 seats of the 23 belonging to minor parties allied with the FpV <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake).</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{statutes}} {{are meant}} to be applied in the main not by legal practitioners and judges but by administrative decision makers. Certain laws receive more judicial interpretation than others, either because more <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> or because those who are affected {{are in a position to}} take the matter to court.

25|$|Wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} spotted hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating one. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when no food or young <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Wolves will confront a hyena approaching too closely to their dens by taking turns in biting the hyena's hocks until it retreats.|$|E

25|$|However, {{subject to}} the {{requirements}} of fairness, a decision-maker should consider whether, on the particular facts of the case, reasons should be given. A failure by the decision-maker to provide reasons may justify an inference that its reasons are bad in law or that it has exercised its powers unlawfully. The rationale behind the argument that a decision-maker should provide reasons is that {{it is one of the}} cornerstones of a good administration. Furthermore, if some right or interest such as livelihood or property <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> or if there is some legitimate expectation, reasons should be given when a decision is adverse to the applicant as a matter of fairness.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts between {{territorial}} Ugandan kob (K. k. thomasi) {{are usually}} settled with ritual and rarely actual fighting, whether in conventional territories or leks. A male usually needs only {{to walk in}} an erect posture towards the intruder to displace him. Neighboring males in leks {{do the same thing}} when they encounter their borders. Lek-holding white-eared kobs fight more often. Ugandan kob do sometimes sustain serious or fatal injuries, especially when control of a territory <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Fights usually involve the combatants clashing, pressing and twisting each other with their horns head-on. However, a neighbor may attack from the rear or side. In lek clusters, the most dominant males occupy the center. The number of males {{in the center of a}} lek cluster ranges from three to seven, and their leks are the most clustered and they monopolize copulations with estrous females. Replacement of males in leks are much more common than in traditional territories, and most males are able to stay in the centre positions for only a day or two and rarely up to a week. This is largely due to intense competition and because most males leave their territories to feed and drink. Centrally located males reduce their chances of being replaced by leaving to feed during periods of relative calmness, yet they are not able to get enough food and water and have to eventually leave their leks. However, a male can gain enough energy after a week or two, and try to take back his position. At every lek cluster, males are always waiting take or retake a central lek. Males in traditional territories are able to stay for at least a year or two.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} McManus to {{describe}} {{the value of the}} Steamtown collection, Jim Boyd, editor of Railfan magazine said, [...] "Everything there is no longer obtainable anywhere, whether it is the [...] "Big Boy" [...] Union Pacific No. 4012 or the Rahway Valley No. 15, a nice-sized locomotive any museum would give a right arm for. [...] Most of the other large collections do not have any serviceable equipment." [...] McManus closed his argument for the relocation of Steamtown by pointing out, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> is more than tourism and jobs. [...] It is a significant part of America's past before the welder's torch is turned on the likes of the 1877 [...] "Prince of Liege", the rare Union Pacific diamond stack, etc. [...] The steel alone is worth $3 million.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of morality plays {{a large role}} in The Monster, especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality. If Trescott's actions are supererogative and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged." [...] Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits [...] "prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill." ...|$|E
