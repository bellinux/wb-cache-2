5|$|Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski {{composed}} {{three pieces}} called Łańcuch ("Chain"), {{which refers to}} the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. Chain 2 was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier Partita for violin and piano, providing a new linking <b>Interlude,</b> so that when played together the Partita, <b>Interlude</b> and Chain 2 form his longest work.|$|E
5|$|An {{intriguing}} <b>interlude</b> {{came about}} in 1967, when Sunderland spent a summer in North America {{playing in the}} United Soccer Association, a league which imported various international clubs. Sunderland worked in North America under the name Vancouver Royal Canadians, finishing fifth in the league's Western Division.|$|E
50|$|Edwards' <b>interludes</b> were republished {{after his}} death, and a {{collection}} of six <b>interludes</b> were published by Isaac Foulkes in 1874.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the album was varied. A common criticism was that the album contained too many <b>interludes.</b> (In fact, there are more musical <b>interludes</b> on the album than there are songs.) Pitchfork Media, for instance, stated {{that many of these}} <b>interludes</b> were [...] "annoying" [...] https://web.archive.org/web/20061117005312/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15010/Apples_in_Stereo_Her_Wallpaper_Reverie.|$|R
500|$|The cycle {{comprises}} sixteen sonatas {{and four}} <b>interludes,</b> arranged symmetrically. Four {{groups of four}} sonatas each are separated by <b>interludes</b> in the following way: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first was}} {{performed}} on the final leg of the Dangerous Tour and at the 1993 American Music Awards. This version included Jackson singing the second verse, chorus, bridge, and third speaking <b>interlude.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{third was}} {{performed}} twice: during both 1999 Michael Jackson & Friends concerts. It {{is similar to}} the 1995 mix, but has clicking sound effects instead of the main drumbeat during the spoken part, and a short <b>interlude</b> with the dancers introducing themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Betances {{obtained}} his baccalauréat (high school diploma). After {{an extended}} vacation in Puerto Rico, {{he went on}} to study medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris from 1848 until 1855, with a short <b>interlude</b> at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier for specific courses in the summer of 1852.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums {{from the}} band, The Dream Walker didn't have any electronic <b>interludes.</b> The band wanted the four tracks on the EP {{to serve as}} the missing <b>interludes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, 8-page digital-first <b>interludes</b> were {{released}} {{to expand on}} the story included in the miniseries, were written once again Dini as well as Derek Fridolfs and drawn {{by a variety of}} artists. The <b>interludes</b> focus on Batman’s enemies as they vie for power within Arkham City. The <b>interludes</b> were later included in print in the Batman: Arkham City collected edition.|$|R
50|$|During {{the same}} period, a Picolo musical was {{produced}} which had musical <b>interludes</b> featuring Picolo. Thereafter, the musical <b>interludes</b> were released individually at different times, between two programs for several years.|$|R
5|$|Set {{pieces in}} Noh {{such as the}} boats, wells, altars, and bells, are {{typically}} carried onto the stage {{before the beginning of}} the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the kyōgen <b>interlude.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{original}} crew left during the Buenos Aires <b>interlude,</b> some through illness and one discharged for misconduct, and replacements were recruited locally. Scotia left for Laurie Island on 21 January, arriving on 14 February. A week later, having settled the meteorological party, who were to be relieved a year later by the Argentine gunboat Uruguay, Scotia set sail for her second voyage to the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{looks more}} to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the concertato style with basso continuo (a device that {{was to become a}} typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental <b>interlude)</b> in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.|$|E
40|$|The article {{concerns}} <b>interludes</b> on Theatine order’s {{stage in}} Lwow college. The very little information about <b>interludes</b> available {{is included in}} manuscripts and printed theatre programmes. <b>Interludes</b> were designed for entertaining the audience, {{and at the same}} time served the purpose of propagating the Unified Catholic Church among the Armenians. The use of Armenian and Polish languages made them closer to the audience, which made the <b>interlude’s</b> task of complementing and commenting the play, and trying to convince the spectators to the idea of unification, much easier.

5|$|The short {{second section}} in common {{time is a}} 12 bar {{bridging}} <b>interlude</b> linking {{the first and third}} sections. The key modulates from D minor to C minor, so that the surrounding first and third sections can modulate from their starting key to its dominant and thus the whole movement can return to its original key at the close.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one <b>interlude</b> episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The <b>interlude</b> episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral <b>interlude</b> a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another <b>interlude</b> the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
50|$|Fresh Aire <b>Interludes</b> is {{an album}} in new age musical group Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh Aire series. The album was {{originally}} released in 1981. The album is {{a compilation of}} piano <b>interludes</b> from the first four Fresh Aire albums. All of its tracks are played by pianist Jackson Berkey.|$|R
50|$|The other musical titles {{listed on}} the album {{represent}} musical <b>interludes</b> of classical, minimalist signature. These <b>interludes</b> {{are the result of}} the collaboration between Fiori and classical music composer and teacher Neil Chotem, and are played either by a single synthetizer or with the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal.|$|R
50|$|All {{forms of}} {{advertising}} {{were removed from}} TV shows for children. This was necessary to fill the gaps left by the missing ads. There was, on disc, entire directories snippets of famous classical music, stripped of all rights. Paul Buissonneau gave free rein to his imagination to sustain his character Piccolo with small adventures accompanied by the music. These <b>interludes</b> have therefore {{been included in the}} regular youth programming on the air instead of advertisements. These <b>interludes</b> were actually gathered during three specials. These <b>interludes</b> were shot on film, and unfortunately, they were lost.|$|R
5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral <b>interlude</b> finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief <b>interlude</b> by Croatian writer Darko Macan, {{the series}} was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired on the {{strength}} of his own series for Vertigo, 100 Bullets. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, catching a serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled pastiche of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250.|$|E
5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback <b>interlude</b> was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E

5|$|John Wark (born 4 August 1957) is a Scottish former footballer {{who spent}} most of his playing time with Ipswich Town. He won a record four Player of the Year awards before {{becoming}} one of the four inaugural members of the club's Hall of Fame. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief <b>interlude</b> dividing his briefer periods at Liverpool and Middlesbrough. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a midfielder, although he sometimes played as a central defender and on occasion as a striker.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant <b>interlude</b> in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat disillusioned by his {{experience}} in New York City (he had philosophical differences with some leaders of the Antillean liberation movements, particularly with Eugenio María de Hostos), Betances spent a short <b>interlude</b> in Jacmel, Haiti in 1870 {{at the request of}} its then-president, Jean Nissage-Saget, who supported Betances' efforts to have a liberal government for the Dominican Republic take power. He later spent some time in the Cibao valley (in both Santiago de los Caballeros and Puerto Plata) where Luperón and Betances attempted to organize another revolt, this time against conservative elements in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
