50|$|Where {{a system}} (such as a modem) {{involves}} round-trip analog-to-digital processing, a distinction is made between analog loopback, where the analog signal is looped back directly, and <b>digital</b> <b>loopback,</b> where the signal is processed {{in the digital}} domain before being re-converted to an analog signal {{and returned to the}} source.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a digital Built-in Self-Test (BIST) {{approach}} to perform specification oriented testing of the analog portion of a mixed-signal system. The BIST utilizes a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) based test pattern generator (TPG) and a multiplieraccumulator (MAC) based output response analyzer (ORA) to stimulate and analyze the analog devices under test, respectively. This approach uses the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which typically already exist in a mixed signal circuits, to connect the digital BIST circuitry to the analog device(s) under test (DUT). Previous work has improved and analyzed the capabilities and effectiveness of using this BIST approach to test analog circuitry; however, little {{work has been done}} to determine the fault coverage of the digital BIST circuitry itself. Traditionally additional test circuitry dedicated to testing would be added to the BIST circuitry to provide adequate fault coverage of digital circuitry. While ensuring that the digital circuitry is thoroughly tested and functioning properly, this circuitry incurs a potentially high area overhead and performance penalty. This thesis focuses on using the existing BIST circuitry to test itself by utilizing a dedicated <b>digital</b> <b>loopback</b> path. A set of test procedures is developed and analyzed whic...|$|E
