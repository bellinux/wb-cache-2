40|$|Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a {{computer-based}} {{production planning}} and inventory control system. MRP {{is concerned with}} both production scheduling and inventory control. It is a material control system that attempts to keep adequate inventory levels to assure that required materials are available when needed. MRP is applicable in situations of multiple items with complex bills of materials. MRP is not useful for job shops or for continuous processes that are tightly linked. The major objectives of an MRP system are to simultaneously: 1. Ensure the availability of materials, components, and products for planned production and for customer delivery, 2. Maintain the lowest possible level of inventory, 3. Plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules, and purchasing activities. MRP is especially suited to manufacturing settings where the demand {{of many of the}} components and subassemblies depend on the demands of items that face external demands. Demand for <b>end</b> <b>items</b> are independent. In contrast, demand for components used to manufacture <b>end</b> <b>items</b> depend on the demands for the <b>end</b> <b>items.</b> The distinctions between independent and dependent demands are important in classifying inventory items and in developing systems to manage items within eac...|$|R

5000|$|MIL-STD-130 {{standard}} requires qualifying government furnished {{property in}} possession of contractors (PIPC), and qualifying <b>end</b> <b>item</b> deliverables or legacy items to be marked with a machine readable 2D Data Matrix bar code. There are several allowed methods for marking, the most common being a polyester or polymide label marked with a thermal transfer printer (the cheapest is about $3,000). Other methods are: metal nameplate laser etched, metal plate metalphoto processed, direct part-marked by dot peen, ink jet, laser etch or chemical etch. The bar code must meet several quality specifications, pass a verification process with a grade of 'B' or better, and [...] "be as permanent as the normal life expectancy of the item and be capable of withstanding the environmental tests and cleaning procedures specified for the item {{to which it is}} affixed". A full list of suggested marking methods are outlined in Table II of MIL-STD-130N.|$|E
40|$|Trying to {{get your}} {{experiment}} aboard ISS? You likely will need power. Many enditem providers do. ISS Plug-In Plan (IPiP) supports power and data for science, Payloads (or Utilization), vehicle systems, and daily operations through the Electrical Power System (EPS) Secondary Power/Data Subsystem. Yet limited resources and increasing requirements continue to influence decisions on deployment of ISS end items. Given the fluid launch schedule and the rapidly- increasing number of <b>end</b> <b>item</b> providers requiring power support, {{the focus of the}} Plug-In Plan has evolved from a simple FIFO recommendation to provide power to <b>end</b> <b>item</b> users, to anticipating future requirements by judicious development and delivery of support equipment (cables, power supplies, power strips, and alternating current (AC) power inverters), employing innovative deployment strategies, and collaborating on <b>end</b> <b>item</b> development.

We present and analyze an approximate cost model. Our approximation is analogous to that for the traditional single-item, continuous-review inventory model that assumes a reorder-point, reorder-quantity policy.
