40|$|In {{the eastern}} {{subtropical}} Pacific Ocean off the continental shelf of Mexico, a pronounced <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> often exists within the euphotic zone. Phytoplankton in this layer used nitrate as their major inorganic source of nitrogen, while {{those in the}} overlying nutricnt-impoverished water used ammonium ion. The uptake of ‘“C-HCOa- generally exhibited two maxima, one above the <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> and the other within it. Chlorophyll a concen-trations usually increased with depth and reached maximum concentrations in the discon-tinuity layer.

40|$|This {{research}} used high-resolution {{magnetic field}} data {{to examine the}} interior structures of MHD shocks in interplanetary space and in the magnetotail; we discovered that a slow-mode shock is often followed by an adjoining rotational <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> on the postshock side. The thickness of each layer is {{of the order of}} a few ion inertial lengths. Such a compound structure is known as a double discontinuity. When the magnetic field rotates by several degrees per ion inertial length inside a thin layer, the Hall current term becomes important in the generalized Ohm's law.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we pursue the {{suggestion}} by Shu, Lubow & Anderson (1979) and Wang (1995) that contact discontinuity (DSC) may {{exist in the}} secondary in the expansion TRO (thermal relaxation oscillation) state. It is demonstrated {{that there is a}} mass exchange instability in some range of mass ratio for the two components. We show that the assumption of constant volume of the secondary should be relaxed in DSC model. For all mass ratio the secondary alway satisfies the condition that no mass flow returns to the primary through the inner Lagrangian point. The secondary will expand in order to equilibrate the interaction between the common convective envelope and the secondary. The contact discontinuity in contact binary undergoing thermal relaxation does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The maintaining condition of contact discontinuity is derived in the time-dependent model. It is desired to improve the TRO model with the advanced contact <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> in future detailed calculations. Comment: 5 pages in emulateapj, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} of abundance and vertical distribution over the shelf are investigated for Ostracoda, Cladocera and Cirripede larvae. The main {{characteristics of the}} environment are the periodical enrichments mainly caused by upwellings, secondly by the river floods. Ostracoda abundance variations approximately follow phytoplankton outburst. Breeding occurs all over the year. Their vertical distribution is correlated with a <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer.</b> Diurnal migration, when it occurs in warm season consists in an upward movement during the night towards surface layers. The Ostracoda inhabit bottom layers {{during the day and}} migrate at night in intermediate and surface layers. For the main two species of Cladocera, Penilia avirostris and Evadne tergestina, abundance periods follow upwellings, especially during the main cool season. However, Cladocera can grow in low salinity but rich waters. On average Penilia inhabits more superficial waters in cold than in warm seasons. Cirripede nauplii and cypris are more abundant off rocky coasts. Their maxima are in the upwelling periods. ...|$|E
40|$|During the "Atlantic Expedition" in 1965 (IQSY) a {{comprehensive}} bathymetric survey {{and a few}} hydrographic stations were made by R. V. "Meteor" in the equatorial region of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The survey results are shown in a bythymetric chart covering the western parts of the Romanche- and Chain Fracture Zones. West of the original Romanche Trench another deep trench with a medium depth of 6000 m was discovered. The maximum sounding obtained was 7028 m. Both trenches apparently {{belong to the same}} fracture zone, but are distinctly separated from each other. The estern boundary of the trench against the Brasil Basin is formed by a sill rising to a depth of about 4400 m. The serial hydrographic observations give some indications of the flow of the cold Westatlantic deep water in the fracture zone area and its influence on the hydrographic conditions in the East-Atlantic Basin. The upper limit of the nearly homogenious Westatlantic bottom water with an Antarctic components lies about 4400 m. The water mass entering the system of trenches of the Romanche Fracture Zone over the western sill originates from {{the lower part of the}} <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> lying above the bottom water. Potential temperatures of 0. 6 °C were the lowest observed by "Meteor" in the western trench. There seems to be a remarkable tongue of relatively high salinity and a minimum of oxygen in the deep water of this trench. At present we can only speculate upon the origin of this highly saline deep water tongue underneath the eastward moving relatively thin layer of less saline Westatlantic deep water. In the range of the sill separating both trenches a lee wave is indicated by the distribution of salinity and oxygen, which implies a vertical transport of water masses. Caused by this transport it is assumed that relatively cold water may be lifted temporarily to a depth, where it can pass the northbounding ridge, thus getting directly into the Sierra Leone Basin. In the original Romanche Trench the cold Westatlantic deep water seems to fill the whole trough, but its extension remains limited to the trench itself. The water masses found east of the sill separating the trench from the East-Atlantic Basin originate from the lower part of the <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer.</b> With potential temperatures of about 1. 3 °C they are much warmer than those observed in the Romanche Trench bottom water...|$|E

40|$|Summary of {{the results}} and {{experiences}} obtained during the work with the oxygen recorder. The apparaus is very simple to build and use, and it works rapidly. It is possible by means of this apparature to take continuous readings of the variations of oxygen content in the water downward from the surface. The readings give a picture which is available immediately, and which may be useful for the marine biologist working at sea. For hydrographic work it may be of interest that the recorder indicates the depths where the oxygen content changes rapidly, which may be important in deciding where to take additional observations. With a few determinations of the oxygen content by the usual method {{it is possible to}} obtain a linear calibration diagram (see Fig. 3) by means of which the oxygen content at various depths can be determined with fairly good accuracy. It is recommended that anyone who starts using the apparatus should at the beginning make usual Winkler determinations of the oxygen content whenever the oxygen recorder is used. This is necessary because the ammeter values are dependent on the purity of the mercury and on the speed of the falling drops. The calibration curve, therefore, will not always go through zero. In water with sharp <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layers</b> it should never be possible lo determine salinity and oxygen content of such layers by means of the usual with any accuracy at all. This is because the water sampler itself is so long that it collects water of greatly varying properties. In such <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layers</b> only continuous recording can give the correct picture. Fig. 4 gives examples of curves obtained by the oxygen recorder...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{sediment}} {{samples of}} zooplankton subfossil at different depths {{were collected from}} a large shallow lake Wuliangsuhai Lake, China, in order to reconstruct lake past changes. The lake began to switch to eutrophication gradually in the middle 1980 s, creating a sediment <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> (about 32. 5 cm depth) that can be visually used to separate sediments derived from plankton and macrophyte. Inferences about the timing and trajectory of eutrophication were made using sediment zooplankton subfossil reconstruction. The changes in composition of the zooplankton fragments were rather gradual up the core, whereas the total numbers of fragments show the most marked changes from 32. 5 cm to present. Changes {{in the composition of}} zooplankton fragments (in 32. 5 cm depth) show a gradual shift from a “pelagic community ” dominated by B. longirostris, reflecting clearwater conditions with high predation pressure, to a more “benthic ” community, dominated by plant associated Chydorids. The results suggest {{that it is possible to}} reconstruct past eutrophication trends of the lake by using zooplankton subfossil, and that anthropogenic pollutant loading is the key factor in the eutrophication of Lake Wuliangsuhai...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA double {{discontinuity}} is {{a compound}} {{structure composed of}} a slow shock layer and an adjoining rotational <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> on the postshock side. We use high-resolution data from Geotail and Wind spacecraft to examine the interior structure within the finite thickness of the discontinuity at the plasma sheet-lobe boundary and found that recognizable MHD structures at the boundary can be stand-alone slow shocks or double discontinuities.

The rotational angle can vary over a wide range. We notice that the observations of double discontinuities are no less frequent than the observations of stand-alone slow shocks. Identification of slow shocks and double discontinuities infers that plasma and magnetic field lines continuously move across the boundary surface from the lobe into the plasma sheet, and there is a conversion of magnetic field energy into plasma thermal energy through the slow shock layer.

This study aimed to assess the ecological quality status of the lagoon, acquire knowledge of a natural environment which might be exploited for aquaculture, and give management hints {{on the basis of}} anthropogenic impact and ecological conditions. A sampling campaign was carried out in 2008 : at six stations, benthic fauna, water and sediment parameters were considered. Statistical analyses were carried out through multivariate procedures (PCA, classification clustering, SIMPER, RDA, DISTLM, PERMANOVA). Ecological quality was assessed through the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) and the Benthic Index based on Taxonomic Sufficiency (BITS). Sediment characteristics (percent organic matter,%OM; redox potential <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> depth, RPDL; particle size composition) and salinity represented contributory influences on lagoon communities. It was possible to distinguish and characterise a confined area, and benthic communities, from a marine-influenced area and its biota. The number of species was quite low when compared with other open Adriatic lagoons. The M-AMBI and BITS classifications gave quite similar results, which seemed consistent with the ecological conditions of the lagoon, that is a distinction in the ecological quality between the seaward and landward stations, with higher ecological quality (EcoQ) at the seaward stations. Given the pressures and the ecological condition of Karavasta, an intensification of aquaculture activities must be considered with caution, since the lagoon seems at significant risk of serious hypereutrophication.

We collected bipinnaria larvae assignable to the genus Odontaster and several types of pilidium larvae of nemertean worms in quantitative net tows taken during the austral spring and summer 1997 - 1998 and considered their distribution with respect to the density stratification of the water column and the potential exposure to UV-B (λ = 308 nm). The average number of pilidium and bipinnaria larvae in the upper 40 m of the water column was 0. 5 ± 1. 0 per m 3 and the highest abundance was 2. 1 per m 3 in early January when 270 bipinnariae were collected at a depth of 28 m. In October and November, water density (σ 1) in the upper 40 m was relatively uniform and bipinnariae and pilidiums were collected from 2 m to the maximum depth sampled (20 - 38 m). Beginning in December and continuing into February, surface melt produced a marked stratification of the upper water column with a major <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> at 10 - 15 m, and larvae were relatively rare near the surface. Larvae drifting at a depth of 4 m during periods of ozone depletion in October and November 1997 would potentially experience average maximum UV-B exposures of 80. 10 joules/m 2 /hr. Later in spring and summer, under a normal ozone column, average maximum potential exposures were 2. 26 joules/m 2 /hr at 14 m, where larvae were abundant. The physiological and ecological consequences of high surface exposures to UV-B during periods of ozone depletion depend on several factors, including stage development and residence times of larvae near the surface, and remain largely unknown...|$|E
40|$|Appreciation of the {{ecological}} and economic values associated with healthy salt marshes {{has led to a}} recent {{rise in the number of}} marshes that are being targeted for restoration by dike removal. The success of restoration is often measured by the return of marsh plants, though this overlooks a key component of salt marshes, that of the invertebrate community within marsh sediments. To evaluate the short-term recovery of these invertebrates, sediment cores were collected across an elevational gradient in a recent dike removal marsh, one and two years post removal, and a nearby reference marsh. Abundance, richness and diversity as well as morphospecies community composition were compared across treatment groups (Reference, Removal) and elevation zone (High Marsh, Low Marsh). Morphospecies richness, abundance and diversity were significantly higher in Low Marsh samples than in High Marsh samples, though no statistically significant differences were found across treatments of the same elevation (e. g., Reference Low Marsh versus Removal Low Marsh). Pair-wise ANOSIM results found significant differences between community compositions across treatments, specifically Reference Low Marsh and Removal Low Marsh. The marsh edge, the lowest point of vascular plant growth before transitioning to tide flats, is considered a high stress environment for emergent vegetation. Plant establishment and survival in this low elevation zone is limited by the tolerance to inundation duration and frequency and anoxic sediments. Bioturbation and burrowing by macroinvertebrates increases the surface area exposed to surface water for gas exchange, increasing the depth of the redox potential <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer.</b> Crabs that make stable, maintained burrows have been shown to increase oxygen penetration into sediment, improving plant productivity. Such crabs are not found in salt marshes of the Pacific Northwest of North America. However, other burrowing invertebrates may have a positive impact on plant health in these areas by reducing abiotic stress due to anoxic sediments, thereby allowing plants to establish and survive lower in the intertidal zone. To assess this potential relationship, study plots of Distichlis spicata were selected at equivalent elevations at the lowest point of plant establishment at the marsh edge. Focal plant rhizomes were severed from upland ramets and assigned an invertebrate abundance treatment based on a visual burrow count surrounding each plant (9 cm diameter).

Except for Lake Shengesa, the {{substrates}} of the lakes have been investigated visually by SCUBA divers. Some quantitative sampling, using underwater techniques, has been carried out in Lake Sibayi. In general, the substrate of the lakes consisted of two types, either fine sand with an average particle size of 3. 2 phi, or mud with a median phi value of less than 6. The sandy substrata was usually rich in fauna, and the mud usually poor. Lake Sibayi, which is freshwater (135 ppm Cl¯) has estuarine and freshwater species in the benthos. Some of the species, notably Grandidierella lignorum and Apseudes digitalis, show an uneven pattern of distribution with respect to depth. Lake Nhlange is a brackwater lake (3. 4 ‰ salinity) and has mainly an estuarine fauna. Many of the species are different from those found in Lake Sibayi. There is some evidence that the benthic fauna of the lake has increased its range in depth in the years following a flood in January 1966. Only chironomid larvae were found in the benthos of Lake Shengesa. The greater part of the substrate of this lake consisted of a highly organic mud mainly derived from burnt grassland around the periphery of the lake. Lake Sifungwe, which is connected to Lake Nhlange, has a halocline at about 9 metres. The fauna of the benthos has more species than lake Nhlange. There is some evidence to suggest that LGC fauna invades deeper water in summer, and is driven into shallower water in winter because of the fluctuating level of anaerobic conditions below the <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer.</b> The benthic fauna of the lakes has been compared with that of the estuaies reported on by the Cape Town Ecological Survey. experimental studies on G. lignorum, a species present in Lake Sibayi, suggested that the physiological responses of material from an estuary normally at 35 ‰ salinity (Kowie River estuary) and from lakes which are normally of low salinity (Groenvlei 2. 5 ‰ salinity, Lake Sibayi) were not different. Studies on substrate choice, and pressure, indicated that these factors do not affect the distribution pattern of G. lignorum in the substrate. Studies on light orientation responses and the effects of rates of carbon dioxide increase of about 20 mm HgC 0 ₂/hr or more, suggest that these may be the principle factors affecting the distribution of G. lignorum in the benthos of Lake Sibayi.

40|$|Studies in the USA have {{reported}} that species of meiobenthic copepods {{can be used as}} bioindicators of sediment-associated contaminants. The main objective of this research project was to develop and validate methods to assess the effects of estuarine pollution, using the marine benthic copepod Robertsonia propinqua as a bioindicator of environmental health in New Zealand intertidal / estuarine areas. Cultures of R. propinqua were set up and maintained in the laboratory and individuals used in 96 h acute and full life-cycle chronic bioassays using the pre-selected contaminants atrazine and zinc sulphate. From the 96 h acute experiments {{it was found that the}} lethal doses at which 50 % mortality occurred (LC 50) for exposed nauplii and adult individuals were 7. 5 mg/L and 31. 8 mg/L, respectively for atrazine and 1. 7 mg/L and 2. 7 mg/L, respectively for zinc sulphate. This indicated that the nauplii life stage was more sensitive than were the adult life stages for exposure to both contaminants. Based on the 'trigger' values reported (atrazine = 0. 013 mg/L, zinc = 0. 015 mg/L) in the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality, which provide values at which concentrations of contaminants can occur in the environment before they begin causing effects on aquatic fauna, it is unlikely that the calculated LC 50 s in the current research will induce biological effects in exposed copepods in the short-term. The calculated LC 50 results were then used to further investigate the effects of chronic exposure of sediment-associated contaminants on the complete life-cycle (egg-reproductive adult) of R. propinqua. In a laboratory-based full life-cycle toxicity test, field-collected sediments from polluted sites in the Auckland and Bay of Plenty regions reduced reproductive output (nauplii and copepodite production) of R. propinqua individuals, but the number of males and females, gravid females, clutch size per female and the number of eggs produced were not affected by either the polluted or non-polluted (reference) sediment samples from both field regions. Field investigations of meiofauna community composition in polluted and non-polluted field sites were carried out in 2004 in the Auckland and Bay of Plenty field regions in New Zealand. Greater sediment organic content and a correspondingly deeper redox potential <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer</b> occurred in all polluted field sites compared with the non-polluted sites. However, species composition could not be used to characterise polluted and non-polluted sites, as there were no dominant taxa which were representative of these sites. The results presented in this thesis indicate that R. propinqua has strong potential to be a good candidate species as a bioindicator of environmental contamination. Furthermore, the full life-cycle toxicity test could be used as a rapid test to detect immediate changes in individual reproduction and development as well as long-term population effects. The technologies developed as part of this research may eventually provide additional tools for commercial environmental consultancies and may compliment existing standard operating procedures for environmental assessments involving pollution of estuarine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|I. Quantitative {{phytoplankton}} samples, {{collected during}} a cruise in the Norwegian Sea in June, 1954, {{by the research}} vessel «G. O. Sars», were worked up {{by means of the}} sedimentation metliod. Data on hydrography, primary production, and zooplankton, were supplied by the Research Division of the Fisheries Directorate, Bergen. The survey included stations in Coastal, Atlantic, Arctic, and Polar water. 2. On the basis of the analyses of the phytoplankton communities, eight vegetation areas were recognized. It was demonstrated that the extent of each vegetation area largely depended on hydrographical features. 3. In Norwegian coastal waters, as well as in Atlantic water in the south-eastern part of the Norwegian Sea, the vegetation was relatively poor, and consisted of small-celled diatoms and coccolithophorids. In the central and north-western parts of the Atlantic region an abundant plankton was present, consisting of Rhizosolenia styliformis and several other diatom species of large or medium cell dimensions, as well as of Phaeocystis pouchetii. A narrow zone of mostly Arctic water at the border of the Atlantic water masses supported a vegetation where the presence of Rhizosolenia hebetata f. semispina and associated species was a characteristic feature. In Polar waters in the north-western part of the Norwegian Sea, the plankton was, in general, very sparse, and was composed mostly of smallcelled algae. 4. The size of standing stocks of phytoplankton was expressed as total cell volume (biomass) per litre of sea water. A comparison was undertaken between available data on hydrography, phytoplankton distribution, biomass and primary production. 5. The occurrence of large biomasses was restricted to the central and north-western Atlantic waters. Production in these waters was markedly higher than elsewhere in the Norwegian Sea (Berge 1958). There was evidence that production here was largely or entirely due to those algae which had been recognized in the preserved plankton samples. The relative shares of the various algae in the total production probably varied greatly between localities, but there was some reason to believe that Phaeocystis pouchetii was, on the whole, the most important producer. 6. Using data obtained {{in the course of the}} investigation, as well as additional information available in literature, the development of the vegetation in the different parts of the Norwegian Sea during the spring of 1954, was discussed. 7. The spring increase probably started earlier in Coastal, Arctic, and Polar waters, where stability in the uppermost strata was achieved early in 1954, than in Atlantic water where a <b>discontinuity</b> <b>layer,</b> if present, was then located at greater depths. 8. In June 1954, the period of high production had been brought to an end in Coastal, Arctic, and Polar waters, possibly because of nutrient exhaustion in the upper strata. The same was true of southeastern Atlantic water masses, where some degree of stability was likewise apparent. In the central and north-western Atlantic waters, however, a general absence of stratification, in conjunction with favourable light conditions and possibly a moderate degree of turbulent activity, accounted for the fact that the plankton here was apparently still at the stage of spring maximum. 9. The possible origin of the initial stocks of the various species was discussed. There was evidence that many of the species constituting the vegetation in the area of large biomasses and high production, had been introduced into Atlantic water in the southern-most part of the Norwegian Sea early in 1954. The importance of the surface currents in distributing initial stocks was stressed. 10. The investigation amply confirmed the earlier idea (Ramsfjell 1960) that the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of the spring development of the phytoplankton in the Norwegian Sea are subject to great variations from one year to another...|$|E
