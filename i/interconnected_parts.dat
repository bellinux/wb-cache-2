25|$|A {{tradition}} Kathakali play typically {{consists of}} two <b>interconnected</b> <b>parts,</b> the third-person Shlokas and first-person Padams. The Shlokas are in Sanskrit and describe the action in the scene, while Padams are dialogues in Malayalam (Sanskritized) for the actors to interpret and play. A Padam consists of three parts: a Pallavi (refrain), Anupallavi (subrefrain) and Caranam (foot), {{all of which are}} set to one of the ancient Ragas (musical mode), based on the mood and context as outlined in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra. In historic practice of a play performance, each Padam was enacted twice by the actor while the vocalists sang the lines repeatedly as the actor-dancer played his role out.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all <b>interconnected</b> <b>parts</b> that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Self-assembly is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} main methods for construction of heterogeneous systems consisting of multiple component types in nano- and micro-scales. The engineered self-assembly used for sys-tem integration involves preparation of parts that can rec-ognize and bind to each other or a template, and perfec-tion of procedures that allow for high yield self-assembly of these parts into a system. Capillary forces resultant from molten alloys are attractive candidates for driving such self-assembly processes as they can simultaneously provide electrical and mechanical connections. The basic self-assembly process is reviewed here. Selection of the appropriate alloy, a critical issue in development of the self-assembly mechanism, is discussed and various can-didates are identified. Examples are provided in which alloys are used to <b>interconnect</b> <b>parts</b> in nano- and micro-scales or produce three-dimensional structures. We con-clude with a brief discussion of opportunities and chal-lenges ahead in the development of system integration processes taking advantage of self-assembly. ...|$|R

The ghetto formation was pronounced by Hamann in June 1941 at which time a 2-3 metre wall was erected along its perimeter, although the ghetto zone existed already since 12 July 1940. It consisted of two <b>interconnected</b> <b>parts</b> of the city centre, both very small. One of them, around Kazimierza Wielkiego Street by the castle, and the second one {{on the other side}} of the river, in the so-called Piekło neighbourhood across the Lwowska Street bridge. Some 12,000 Jews were forced to relocate there. In the following months, more Jews were resettled to Nowy Sącz from the General Government and territories of Poland annexed by Nazi Germany; forced by the SS to subsist on little to nothing in extremely overcrowded conditions. Often 20 people were assigned to one room. The Ghetto was entirely dependent on the German authorities for food. Starvation rations were introduced. In the fall of 1941, some 30 Jews where caught and executed following failed escape attempt across the border to the Soviet occupied eastern part of Poland. The total number of Jews in the ghetto grew to 18,000.|$|E
50|$|Complexity in {{networks}} {{is tied to}} {{the notion}} of elements of the system or networks have relationships amongst themselves which from relationships they may have with other elements outside their group. A complex system is a system composed of <b>interconnected</b> <b>parts</b> that as a whole exhibit one or more properties which can be obvious when viewing the system as a whole, however when viewing the individual components of the system their potential to produce is not visible (or obvious).A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows structure with a number of variations. It is very sensitive to initial conditions and small alterations to these can result in dramatically different outcomes as chaos theory suggests, {{there are a number of}} pathways and evolutions which the 'butterfly’s wings' are able to affect. A complex system is one that by design or function or both is difficult to understand and verify. There are multiple simultaneous interactions by actors and components which lead to an overall output of a system.It is important in a marketing environment to recognize that there are many levels of complex systems at play and that targeting individual parts of production, advertising or other aspects will not often result in proportional outputs. On this note it is also important to recognize the nesting potential in a market complex system, where a market is made up of different firms which are complex systems themselves, which in turn are made up of people who also exhibit complex system functionalities. The market must be viewed as a whole to understand the sum of the parts and analyze emergent behaviors. The many aspects of complex systems mean that they are unpredictable and involve aspects of chaos and non-linearity and this in turn leads to the rise in small-world phenomena.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} polymer {{modification}} {{on the physical}} properties of cementitious mortars is investigated using a multimethod approach. Special emphasis is put on the identification and quantification of different polymer components within the cementitious matrix. With respect to thin-bed applications, particularly tile adhesives, the spatial distributions of latex, cellulose ether (CE), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and cement hydration products can be quantified. It is shown that capillary forces and evaporation induce water fluxes in the <b>interconnected</b> <b>part</b> of the pore system, which transport CE, PVA, and cement ions to the mortar interfaces. In contrast, the distribution of latex remains homogeneous. In combination with results from qualitative experiments, the quantitative findings allow reconstruction of the evolution from fresh to hardened mortar, including polymer film formation, cement hydration, and water migration. The resulting microstructure and the failure modes can be correlated with the final adhesive strength of the tile adhesive. The results demonstrate that skinning prior to tile inlaying can strongly reduce wetting properties of the fresh mortar and lower final adhesive strength...|$|R
