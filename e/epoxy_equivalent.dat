40|$|The {{response}} of avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) {{used in the}} CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter to low energy neutrons from an Americium-Beryllium source is reported. Signals due to recoil protons from neutron interactions with the hydrogen nuclei in the protective epoxy layer, mainly close to the silicon surface of the APD, have been identified.

40|$|The {{historical}} design {{approach for}} ensuring survivability in devices that operate at high voltages which would arc in air or that must survive substantial shock loadings employs an encapsulant whose dielectric strength prevents electrical breakdown and whose modulus prevents gross {{movement of the}} embedded components. While mostly successful, this approach presents some significant design challenges: (1) the high thermal expansion of the epoxy leads to large stresses during thermal cycles, (2) degassing of the epoxy before cure and careful encapsulation are essential to eliminate voids that could initiate dielectric breakdown, (3) the internal components are embedded deep within an impenetrable encapsulant and “removable” options have proven somewhat problematic, (4) the filled epoxy encapsulant adds weight. It is {{the intent of this}} study to develop a new design strategy that will eliminate these issues resulting in a cost effective, lighter and more robust component with fewer defects. The new paradigm rests on employing two materials, instead of just one, to achieve the desired effect. First, a thin coating applied to the board will provide both dielectric breakdown protection and/or support for components on boards. Second, a foam encapsulation will provide both bulk rigidity and damping in shock environments. This two-stage approach lessens dielectric requirements of the bulk encapsulant and shifts them to the coating. It also affords greater flexibility in optimizing materials and processing properties to achieve design objectives and enhanced manufacturability. Commercially available coatings have been chosen for the study to span a wide variety of application techniques and performance requirements. A standardized test, ASTM D 149, was conducted on each coating to quantitatively compare dielectric coating strength at both room temp and a severe aging environment. For certain coatings it is proven that the dielectric strength degrades in a humid environment. These coatings were also placed on printed circuit board geometries with and without components and tested extensively using both DC and pulsed AC testing systems developed specifically for this study. In the absence of a coating, i. e., a bare board in an ambient air atmosphere, breakdown occurs at 10 kV or less. For one of the geometries explored in this study, the results have shown that thin coatings of less than 5 mils (. 127 mm) prevent breakdown up to or exceeding the 80 kV or higher for flat wire traces. If, in addition to the thin coating, a bead coating is applied to high voltage electrical components with topographical contours, the breakdown voltage is in the 40 - 60 kV range for component gaps of 0. 05 to 0. 425 in. The use of a polyurethane foam encapsulant results in breakdown voltages of 50 - 70 kV for the same component gaps as long as the gap between components is not small enough to prevent the foam from filling it. Combining a foam and coating as the packaging can increase the breakdown voltage range to 50 - 80 kV for these component gaps. The adhesion strength of the polymer coatings was also characterized in its original state and after aging in a humid environment. In many cases, adhesion strength is known to degrade in humid environments. The adhesion strength of the coatings to the printed circuit board interface is considerably lower than that found for epoxy bonds using <b>epoxy</b> adhesives of <b>equivalent</b> glass transition temperatures. Foam adhesion to the coatings was also characterized. Adhesion between the packaging foam and coatings was found to be either maximized at 249 psi or minimized at 48 psi depending on the coating chosen. Contact angle measurements were made to study wetting ability. Equilibrium contact angles for all coatings on solder mask are reached in less than 3 minutes. The results of this study demonstrate the viability of this novel packaging strategy. Sandia National Lab...|$|R

30|$|Generally, the {{absorption}} band around 910  cm- 1 {{was assigned to}} monitor the <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> conversion (the C-O-C bond of epoxy groups) [45, 46]. Figure  5 b,c shows the FT-IR spectrum of the composites with unmodified and modified nano-TiO 2, respectively. The decreased intensity of {{the absorption}} band {{could be attributed to}} the ring-opening of epoxy groups induced by the reaction between hydroxyl of COOH and epoxy groups during the crosslinking. In contrast to the sample with unmodified nano-TiO 2, the sample with modified nano-TiO 2 exhibits larger decreasing amplitude of the absorbance. Particularly, the absorbance at 908  cm- 1 as a function of temperature for the two systems were plotted in Figure  5 d, demonstrating a faster decreasing tendency of the absorbance at this band for the polyester/modified nano-TiO 2 composite. It suggests a promoting effect of modified nano-TiO 2 on the crosslinking reaction.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{advanced}} epoxy resins (2) were {{prepared by the}} nucleophilic addition of cresol novolac epoxy (CNE) with a benzoxazine monomer (1), which is prepared by a one-pot procedure using 2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4 -aminophenol and 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene 10 -oxide (DOPO) as starting materials. The nucleophilic addition was monitored by <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> weight titration and NMR analysis. Based on this approach, {{the overall number of}} functionality of the resulting epoxy resins was retained because a curable benzoxazine linkage was also incorporated after the nucleophilic addition. As a result, high-Tg thermosets qualified for the UL- 94 V- 0 rating can be achieved after curing. When an UL- 94 V- 0 rating was achieved, Tg as high as 245 degrees C (DMA data) was obtained for 4, 4 '-diaminediphenyl sulfone (DDS) -cured systems. The corresponding phosphorus content for the UL- 94 V- 0 rating was as low as 0. 61 wt%. The flame-retardant nature of oxazine linkage and nitrogen-phosphorus synergistic effect might be responsible for the low phosphorus content required for flame retardancy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However; epoxy coatings absorbs moisture easily, and the diffusion of absorbed water into the epoxy. steel interface weakens the interfacial adhesion strength between epoxy and steel in corrosive enviroment, due to the presence of hydrophilic hydroxy group in the cured network (epoxy/amine reaction).

40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of functionalized fluorocooligomers based on chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and {{allyl glycidyl ether}} (AGE) under radical copolymerization is presented. The compositions of comonomers in the cooligomers were determined by three different analyses viz: from 1 H and 19 F NMR spectroscopy by using 1, 3 -bis(trifluoromethyl) benzene as the external standard, <b>epoxy</b> <b>equivalent</b> weight value, and elemental analyses. The compositions determined by three methods were matching reasonably well and showed that the esulting poly(CTFE-co- AGE) cooligomers exhibit a tendency for alternation. The distribution of the monomers in the cooligomers was proposed based on {{the assessment of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers. These values were determined from the kinetics of radical copolymerization of CTFE with AGE from Fineman- Ross, Kelen-Tudos, and extended Kelen-Tudos methods which led to the assessment of the average reactivity ratios as: rCTFE ¼ 0. 20 6 0. 03 and rAGE ¼ 0. 15 6 0. 08 at 74 C. The lower Mn values substantiated the formation of cooligomers rather than copolymers. The formation of cooligomers was attributed to the chain transfer to AGE (by hydrogen abstraction from AGE) from the allylic transfer. The poly(CTFE-co-AGE) cooligomers were soluble in most of the common organic polar solvents. An optimization of cooligomer yields was investigated by using ethyl vinyl ether as a third comonomer and from different initiators. The thermal stabilities of the cooligomers, obtained by thermal gravimetric analysis, showed a 5 % weight loss at temperatures over 225 C under air...|$|E
