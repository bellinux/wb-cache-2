Antigen made from sterile pus aspirated from previously unruptured abscesses, produced a reaction in patients with lymphogranuloma inguinale when injected intradermally.

50|$|Clonorchiasis sinensis is a {{trematode}} (fluke) {{which is}} part of the phylum Platyhelminthes. It is a hermaphroditic fluke that requires two intermediate hosts. The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver. The eggs of the worms are passed through fecal matter which are then ingested by mollusks. One becomes infected by eating undercooked, smoked, pickled salted freshwater fish. Freshwater fish are a second intermediate host for the parasitic worm. They become infected when the larvae (cercaria) of the worm penetrates the flesh of the fish. The water snail is the first intermediate host in which a miracidium (an <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> discharged in stool) goes through its developmental stages (sporocyst, rediae and cercariae). Clonorchiasis is endemic in the Far East, especially in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Southern China. Clonorchiasis has been reported in non endemic areas (including the United States). In such cases, the infection follows the ingestion of imported, undercooked or pickled freshwater fish containing metacercariae.|$|E
50|$|M. temperatus {{preferentially}} infects snails-its first intermediate host, tadpoles, and frogs-its definitive host. Thus, environments harboring M. temperatus include streams, ponds, {{and bodies}} of water. Snails, commonly Helisoma trivolvis, H. antosum and H. campanulata, acquire infection {{by way of}} miracidia penetration. Upon <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> deposition into aqueous environments from feces of adult flukes in the large intestine of tadpoles and rectum of frogs, miracidia penetrate snails and undergo three generations of rediae in the liver-the third producing and releasing an immature cercariae into the tissues of the snail host. Daily shedding of mature cercariae opportunistically encyst on the skin of tadpoles and adult frogs, particularly the dark spots of the fore and hindlegs. Tadpoles then become infected by ingestion of such encysted metacercariae or inhalation of free cercariae and attach onto the large intestine and become gravid. During the process of metamorphosis, the process at which tadpoles structurally mature into adult frogs, flukes migrate superiorly into the small intestine, {{as far as possible}} as to elude being dispensed. As the intestine shortens after metamorphosis and adolescent frogs begin development of a protein diet, the remaining flukes return to the rectum. Infection in adult frogs may also occur by ingestion of metacercariae.|$|E

40|$|Neospora caninum causes {{economical}} {{impact in}} cattle-raising farms {{since it is}} implicated as the major cause of bovine abortions. Although infection by the parasite has been widely described in mammals, the role of birds in its life-cycle is still obscure. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the infection by N. caninum in different chicken models. Experimental infections were conducted in 7 -day-old chicks, laying hens and <b>embryonated</b> <b>eggs,</b> where samples were analysed for parasite burden, IgG antibodies and lesions promoted. Chickens demonstrated an asymptomatic infection, although with seroconversion and systemic replication of the parasite. In laying hens, no signs of vertical transmission were observed. However, <b>embryonated</b> <b>eggs</b> inoculated by the allantoic cavity route demonstrated susceptibility to infection, with mor-tality rates around 50 % independent of the inoculum dose. Additionally, dogs became infected after ingestion of different amounts of inoculated eggs, producing either oocysts or specific IgG antibodies.

Viable 0 - 24 hr-old <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> masses were separately exposed to five different concentrations (7. 81 - 2000 mg/l) of extracts for 24 hrs, washed in dechlorinated tap water and incubated {{at room temperature}} for a maximum of 4 weeks. The LC 50 and LC 90 values of test extracts for egg masses were calculated by probit analysis. The activities of the tested extracts were concentration-dependent. However, only the ethanolic extract of the fruits demonstrated significant activity (24 hr-LC 90 value < 100 mg/l: 89. 29 mg/l). Mortalities of eggs were manifested at the gastrula/exogastrula and or the prehatch snail stage of development. The percentage of dead embryos at the prehatch snail stage decreased while the deaths of embryos at the gastrula/exogastrula stage increased, with increasing concentration of extract. Lethality of the ethanolic extract of D. sissoo fruits to <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> masses of B. pfeifferi is an added advantage to its potential development for use as a plant molluscicide, as the overall efficacy of a molluscicide is greatly enhanced if it also shows significant toxicity towards snail eggs...|$|E

Frozen sections were subdivided into four morphologically distinct compartments for analysis of the development of the circulating antibody response. The fluid surrounding the larva was the most reactive up to 21 days after infection, and this material was found to be predominantly excretory-secretory in nature. As the infection progressed antibodies directed against ‘somatic ’ tissue materials increased. Cross reactions between sera from rabbits infected with T. canis eggs and Toxascaris leonina frozen sections, and rabbits infected with T. leonina eggs and Toxocara canis frozen sections occurred between both the excretory-secretory fluid and somatic components of the infective eggs. These results were substantiated using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. When T. canis excretory-secretory antigen was used, an earlier response (peak day 2 1) was detected than when using T. canis <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> extract (peak day 35). However, cross reactions between T. canis excretory-secretory antigen and sera from rabbits infected with Toxascaris leonina occurred, indicating that the sero-diagnosis of visceral larva migrans using Toxocara canis excretory-secretory antigen may still prove unsatisfactory when considering the role of Toxascaris as a possible causative agent...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrowth of {{influenza}} viruses in embryonated eggs frequently {{results in the}} selection of virus variants with amino acid changes near the receptor-binding pocket of the hemagglutinin molecule, yet the mechanism by which this third form {{of influenza}} variation occurs (the other two being antigenic drift and shift) has not been clearly defined. Because egg-mediated variation might affect influenza vaccine and surveillance programs, we have initiated studies to determine the site(s) of variant virus selection within the <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg.</b> In this report we show that both the cells of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the fluids from embryonated chicken eggs are capable of selecting variant influenza viruses, but that these variants are distinct at the molecular level depending on the conditions of virus propagation. Serial passage of viruses in cells of the chorioallantoic membrane selects one set of variants which possess specific amino acid changes near the receptor binding pocket of the hemagglutinin molecule characteristic of viruses grown in embryonated eggs. However, passage of the same viruses in mammalian tissue culture cells supplemented with egg fluids selects a separate set of hemagglutinin variants also characteristic of viruses grown in eggs, yet at different residues from those observed following passage in CAM. These results suggest that two separate mechanisms may exist in the <b>embryonated</b> <b>egg</b> that lead to the selection of variant influenza viruses: one at the cellular level and another at the extracellular level...|$|E
