500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), {{also known as}} the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. As is typical of bird-eating raptors, {{peregrine falcon}}s are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males.

Midterm assessment was conducted 2011 to determine impact of these MDAs on LF in these districts. Methodology/Principal Findings: The mf prevalence and intensity in the 12 districts were determined using the thick blood film method and results compared with baseline data from 2007 – 2008. Overall mf prevalence fell from 2. 6 % (95 % CI: 2. 3 %– 3. 0 %) to 0. 3 % (95 % CI: 0. 19 %– 0. 47 %), a decrease of 88. 5 % (p = 0. 000); prevalence was 0. 0 % (100. 0 % decrease) in four districts: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema and Kono (p = 0. 001, 0. 025, 0. 085 and 0. 000 respectively); and seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence of between 70. 0 % and 95. 0 % (p = 0. 000, 0. 060, 0. 001, 0. 014, 0. 000, 0. 000 and 0. 002 for Bombali, Bonthe, Kailahun, Kambia, Koinadugu, Port Loko and Tonkolili districts respectively). Pujehun had baseline mf prevalence of 0. 0 %, which was maintained. Only Bombali still had an mf prevalence$ 1. 0 % (1. 58 %, 95 % CI: 0. 80 %– 3. 09 %)), {{and this is the}} district that had the highest baseline mf prevalence: 6. 9 % (95 % CI: 5. 3 %– 8. 8 %). Overall arithmetic mean mf density after three MDAs was 17. 59 mf/ml (95 % CI: 15. 64 mf/ml– 19. 55 mf/ml) among mf positive individuals (65. 4 % decrease from baseline of 50. 9 mf/ml (95 % CI: 40. 25 mf/ml– 61. 62 mf/ml; p = 0. 001) and 0. 05 mf/ml (95 % CI: 0. 03 mf/ml– 0. 08 mf/ml) for the entir...|$|R

40|$|The United Nations {{recommended}} {{system was}} approved in 1972 (II/ 11), {{based on a}} report prepared by D. N. Sharma. The note on the system was published in volume II of the conference report 1. There {{is no evidence of}} the use of the system either in Nepal or in international cartographic products. The resolution IV/ 17 (1982) recommended association, inter alia, with Nepal in carrying out further studies on the system. In Nepal a system of romanization is employed by the Nepal Survey Department (NSD). This system has been applied to names appearing on national mapping, and it is also used in the <b>Geographic</b> Information Infrastructure <b>Programme</b> (NGIIP) 2.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of surveillance data facilitates the planning, implementation {{and evaluation of}} disease control <b>programmes.</b> <b>Geographic</b> information systems (GIS) have several functions, including input (database functions), analysis (interpolation, cluster detection, identification of spatial risk factors) and output (sampling design, disease risk maps). This paper focuses on visualisation techniques that enable improved design and evaluation of surveillance data. Data generated within a pilot GIS-based surveillance programme for avian influenza in village poultry in the Romanian county of Tulcea is used as an example. The use of kriging helped highlight areas {{in the country where}} sampling potentially was sub-optimal, and error maps demonstrated the level of confidence that can be placed in serological surveillance results in different localities. Disease surveillance systems traditionally have not focused on the issues of disease risk and sample size visualisation. Standards need to be developed on how sampling and disease data generated within animal health surveillance systems are analysed and presented. This is particularly important for transboundary diseases such as avian influenza...|$|R
40|$|Craniofacial {{reconstruction}} (CFR) is {{a technique}} used to rebuild the living facial appearance onto a skull in order to recognise or identify an individual. This technique is primarily employed in forensic investigation, but also utilised in archaeological research to recreate the faces of paleontological and archaeological humans. In this study, {{the face of a}} 17 th century historical figure from Korea was reconstructed utilising computerized tomography from the mummified remains. A <b>geographic</b> surface comparison <b>programme</b> was employed to evaluate the accuracy of the CFR produced using a three-dimensional computerized modelling system. Analysis of the facial tissue depth discrepancies demonstrated that the CFR may have acceptable resemblance to the living face of the historical individual. Using computerised graphic technology, the CFR outcome, along with the archaeological information about the hair style, ornaments, and dress discovered in the tomb, a portrait-styled in the typical drawing trend from the era was created. The research suggests that current CFR techniques can provide an accurate portrait drawing of historical figures in Korea...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) treatment programmes occurs in varied environmental, {{social and economic}} contexts. Programme impact will be influenced by factors that affect {{the reduction in the}} prevalence and intensity of infections following treatment, as well as the subsequent rate of reinfection. To better understand the heterogeneity of programme impact and its underlying reasons, we investigated the influence of contextual factors on reduction in STH infection as part of the national school based deworming (SBD) programme in Kenya. Data on the prevalence and intensity of infection were collected within the monitoring and evaluation component of the SBD programme at baseline and after delivery of two annual treatment rounds in 153 schools in western Kenya. Using a framework that considers STH epidemiology and transmission dynamics, capacity to deliver treatment, operational feasibility and financial capacity, data were assembled at both school and district (county) levels. <b>Geographic</b> heterogeneity of <b>programme</b> impact was assessed by descriptive and spatial analyses. Factors associated with absolute reductions of Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infection prevalence and intensity were identified using mixed effects linear regression modelling adjusting for baseline infection levels. The reduction in prevalence and intensity of A. lumbricoides and hookworms varied significantly by county and within counties by school. Multivariable analysis of factors associated with programme impact showed that absolute A. lumbricoides reductions varied by environmental conditions and access to improved sanitation at schools or within the community. Larger reduction in prevalence and intensity of hookworms were found in schools located within areas with higher community level access to improved sanitation and within counties with higher economic and health service delivery indicator scores. The study identifies factors associated with the impact of school-based deworming and in particular highlights how access to water, sanitation and hygiene and environmental conditions influence the impact of deworming programmes...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} devoted to the mapping of legal and policy {{instruments}} of the EU for human rights and democracy support. In particular, it highlights the EU´s human rights priorities in terms of themes and vulnerable groups in its external action based on a review of EU policy documents and literature. In order to do so the report first identifies the instruments that set up the frame of the human rights and democracy policy. The framework of the EU’s human rights and democracy policy is presided by the Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, which establishes the principles, objectives and priorities that must guide the EU’s action. Two general objectives, each with a different scope, can be identified in the Strategic Framework: the EU’s and its Member States’ commitment to promote the universality of human rights and the EU’s determination to promote human rights and democracy in its external action. In addition, the Strategic Framework highlights some areas of action which identify specific objectives and priority themes and groups. Although the Strategic Framework is on human rights and democracy, the emphasis throughout the document is on human rights, not on democracy. Democracy is ‘an aspiration’ that it is not defined. There are other relevant documents that set out the EU´s human rights and democracy policy. As well as general policy papers on mainstreaming human rights and promoting human rights and democracy in the EU external action, there are specific human rights guidelines on priority themes and vulnerable groups and human rights strategies towards particular third countries. In order to implement its human rights and democracy policy, the EU has developed a broad range of instruments. Some of them have been especially created in order to contribute to the specific objective of the promotion of human right and democracy worldwide; in particular, the EIDHR, the human rights clauses, the human rights focal points in EU Delegations, the EUSR for Human Rights, election support and the human rights dialogues and consultations. Moreover, the EU uses other traditional instruments of its CFSP to promote human rights and democracy in its relations with third countries. These instruments respond to the EU’s objective of mainstreaming human rights and democracy in all its policies and actions toward third countries. Among them, those that should be highlighted are the EU’s action in multilateral fora, bilateral political dialogues, démarches and declarations,, CFSP decisions, restrictive measures and, finally, thematic and <b>geographic</b> financial <b>programmes.</b> Regular assessment of the implementation of the EU’s human rights and democracy policy is one of the outcomes stated in the Action Plan. This evaluation of policy is mainly carried out through one specific instrument: the EU’s Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the world. In addition, {{as a consequence of the}} EU’s approach to put human rights at the core of its external action, human rights and democracy promotion constitute also an important part of other EU’s Annual Reports relating to other external policies, such as CFSP and Development...|$|R
