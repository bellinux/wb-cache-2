40|$|An {{activated}} metal {{treatment system}} (AMTS) removes and destroys polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) found in painted structures or within the binding or caulking material on structures. It may be applied using a "paint-on and wipe-off" process {{that leaves the}} structure PCB-free and virtually unaltered in physical form. AMTS is {{used in conjunction with}} a solvent solution capable of donating hydrogen atoms. AMTS as a treatment technology has two functions: first, to extract PCBs from the material, and second, to degrade the extracted PCBs. The process for removing PCBs from structures is accomplished as an independent step to the degradation process. The goal is to extract the PCBs out of the paint, without destroying the paint, and to partition the PCBs into an environmentally friendly solvent. The research to date indicates this can be accomplished within the first 24 hours of AMTS contact with the paint. PCBs are extremely hydrophobic and prefer to be in the AMTS over the <b>hardened</b> <b>paint</b> or binder material. The solvent selected must be used to open, but not to destroy, the paint s polymeric lattice structure, allowing pathways for PCB movement out of the paint and into the solvent. A number of solvent systems were tested and are available for use within the AMTS. The second process of the AMTS is the degradation or dehalogenation of the PCBs. The solvent selection for this process is limited to solvents that are capable of donating a hydrogen atom to the PCB structure. Additional AMTS formulation properties that must be addressed for each site-specific application include viscosity and stability. The AMTS must be thick enough to remain where it is applied. Several thickening agents have been tested. Adding a stabilizing agent ensures that the AMTS will not evaporate and leave unprotected, activated metal exposed. During AMTS formulation testing, a number of reagents were evaluated to ensure the rate of dehalogenation was not inhibited by its addition to the system...|$|E

5000|$|Premature <b>hardening</b> of <b>paint,</b> called [...] "skinning" [...] {{because it}} forms a skin {{on the surface of}} the paint, can be {{inhibited}} by the addition of volatile ligands. These ligands bind to the oil drying agents, then lose their inhibiting action as they themselves slowly volatilize and leave the drying agent to work. One such inhibitor is methylethyl ketone oxime (MEKO), which is called an [...] "antiskinning agent".|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to combustion, many polymerization reactions involve free radicals. As a result, many plastics, enamels, and other polymers are formed through radical polymerization.

50|$|A French word {{originally}} {{referring to}} sticky, partly <b>hardened</b> scraps of <b>paint,</b> marouflage is a 3,000-year-old technique.

50|$|Following this, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune {{conducted a}} further investigation. The resulting film was first shown July 2011. Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce traveled to Amsterdam where they obtained {{samples of the}} paints used by van Meegeren. These included an artificial resin {{which turned out to}} be Bakelite. The use of Bakelite had the effect of <b>hardening</b> the <b>paint</b> and thus making it difficult to detect that it was new. Chemical analysis showed Bakelite in the Courtauld painting, thus confirming that it was a modern forgery. Van Meegeren is the only forger known to have used this technique, so the painting was attributed to him. It was probably intended to be used as a prop in Vermeer forgeries. Ironically, it is more valuable as a van Meegeren forgery than as a 17th-century studio copy.|$|R

The Lady was a design intended {{to appeal to}} women; the Lady is manufactured out of <b>painted,</b> <b>hardened,</b> porcelain and does not feature a clip as {{it was thought that}} women do not normally make use of the clip—a small protrusion prevents the pen from rolling on a flat surface. The Lady was designed by Wolfgang Fabian and Sharon Jodjaja was responsible for the barrel designs.|$|R
500|$|In 1932, van Meegeren {{moved to}} the village of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin with his wife. There he rented a {{furnished}} mansion called [...] "Primavera" [...] and set out to define the chemical and technical procedures that would be necessary to create his perfect forgeries. He bought authentic 17th century canvases and mixed his own paints from raw materials (such as lapis lazuli, white lead, indigo, and cinnabar) using old formulas to ensure that they were authentic. In addition, he created his own badger-hair paintbrushes similar to those that Vermeer was known to have used. He came up with a scheme of using phenol formaldehyde (Bakelite) to cause the <b>paints</b> to <b>harden</b> after application, making the paintings appear as if they were 300 years old. After completing a painting, van Meegeren would bake it at [...] to [...] to <b>harden</b> the <b>paint,</b> and then roll it over a cylinder to increase the cracks. Later, he would wash the painting in black India ink to fill in the cracks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, the {{microstructure}} and properties {{of a novel}} Al- 0. 90 Mg- 0. 78 Si alloy with Zn addition were investigated by electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD), high transmission electron microscopy (HREM), mechanical properties and Erichsen tests. The average grain size of the alloy after pre-ageing was about 20 µm. The yield strength and elongation of pre-aged alloy was 137 MPa and 30 % respectively. The IE value of the alloy was 8. 6 mm. After paint baking at 170 °C for 30 min, the increment of yield strength was about 100 MPa. GP(II) zones were formed in the alloy during paint baking process through adding Zn, which should play {{a very important role}} for improving <b>paint</b> <b>hardening</b> response.

60|$|I {{was then}} curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it, {{it was nothing}} but this: it was a timber house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all this {{plastering}} was really China ware--that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the large China ware in England is painted, and hard {{as if it had}} been burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with <b>hardened</b> and <b>painted</b> tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley- tiles in England, all made of the finest china, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several parts of England; as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile; the ceiling and all the plastering work in the whole house were of the same earth; and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining black. This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could have stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They told me there were fountains and fishponds in the garden, all paved on the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, burnt whole.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the needs of}} the aviation and automotive markets for structural materials and presents examples of developments of aluminum alloy products to fill these needs. Designers of aircraft desire materials which will allow them to design lightweight, cost-effective structures which have the performance characteristics of durability and damage tolerance. Their needs are being met by new and emerging materials varying from Al-Li alloys for thick structure, high-strength plate and extrusions for wings, and new monolithic and aluminum-fiber laminates for fuselages. Increase in fuel economy because of lighter weight structure is the driving force for aluminum alloys in the automotive market, and cost is extremely important. Mechanical properties for automotive use also depend on the application, and corrosion resistance must be adequate. For "hang-on" components such as fenders and hoods, formability is typically the limiting mechanical property. Strength must be adequate to resist denting at a thickness which offers cost-effective weight savings over steel. Because formability often decreases with increasing yield strength, alloys which are highly formable in the T 4 temper and which age <b>harden</b> during the <b>paint</b> bake operation were developed. Alloys such as 6009 and 6010 are now being challenged by 2008, 6111 and 6016. Body structure components must be made from materials which absorb energy and fail gracefully during a crash. Such components for an automotive space frame are being die cast from an Al-Si-Mg alloy. These ductile die castings are joined to thin 6 XXX extrusions which must combine formability, strength, ductility and the ability to deform plastically on impact. Bumpers must combine strength and adequate formability; in the event that current alloys are inadequate for future needs, a new 7 XXX alloy offers an improved combination of properties...|$|R
