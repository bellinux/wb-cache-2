5|$|During {{his years}} in Amherst, Beecher had his <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> public {{speaking}} and, setting aside his early dream of going to sea, resolved to join the ministry. He met his future wife, Eunice Bullard, {{the daughter of a}} well-known physician, and on January 2, 1832, became engaged to her. During his Amherst years, he also developed an interest in the new pseudoscience of phrenology—an attempt to link personality traits with features of the human skull—and befriended Orson Squire Fowler, who later became the theory's best-known American exponent.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store.

5|$|After the war, Clarke had {{a varied}} {{military}} career {{that began with}} a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat. While on extended leave in Turkey in 1922, he {{became involved in the}} Chanak Crisis, a threatened Turkish attack on British and French troops. Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the activities that would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif War for the Morning Post.|$|E
5|$|Black {{was born}} in Salix, Iowa. He had his <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> {{professional}} baseball in 1937, when he was signed by the Fairbury Jeffs of the Nebraska State League. The Jeffs were the rookie-level minor league team of the St. Louis Browns farm system. He played alongside two others who would later make the major leagues, George Bradley and Johnny Lucadello. Black pitched in 26 games for the Jeffs, posting a 5-11 record, 154 innings pitched, and a 4.85 ERA. He spent {{the next three years}} out of professional baseball, then signed a contract with the Petersburg Rebels of the Virginia League.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was mounted}} by other ballet {{companies}} in Europe and America {{almost immediately after}} its first night. The British had their <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> Giselle with a drama based on the ballet called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, who had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi {{in the role of}} Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas, met with little enthusiasm.|$|E

50|$|Several of America's most {{influential}} 20th-century acting teachers, such as Stella Adler (daughter of Jacob and Sara Adler and sister of actor Luther Adler) and Lee Strasberg, had their <b>first</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> theatre in Yiddish. Though {{some of the}} methods developed by them {{and other members of}} the Group Theatre were reactions to the often melodramatic and larger-than-life style of Yiddish theatre, this style nonetheless informed their theories and left its stamp on them. Yiddish theatre was also highly influential on what is still known as Jewish humor.|$|R
5|$|He had his <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> {{professional}} baseball in 1938, {{when he signed}} with the Clovis Pioneers of the West Texas–New Mexico League.

5|$|Linde's <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> {{minor league}} action came in 1942, {{when he signed}} with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League. His {{performances}} that season included a near-no-hitter that {{was lost in the}} ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances.

He competed at the Safari Rally first time in 1983 driving a Nissan pick-up navigated by Gavin Bennett, reaching ninth position and a class victory, gaining the attention of rally people.|$|R
50|$|John C. Holland was {{the fifth}} of {{thirteen}} children. His father encouraged his sons to not only excel at school and help with the family business but also to work at an after school job. Holland opted to sell copies of the local newspaper The Hamilton Spectator {{at the corner of}} King and James. As an eleven-year-old boy, he was required to defend his corner daily against encroachment from other newsboys, and it was here that he suffered his <b>first</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> racial discrimination but also developed a strong belief in a higher power and a commitment to his church and his community.|$|R

For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life.

5|$|Shortly before Feller {{left for}} combat, {{his father died}} of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she {{was a student at}} Rollins College.

5|$|Irvine's <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} football came in 1958, when {{he represented}} the Northern Ireland schoolboy {{team in the}} Victory Shield. Five years later, he made his debut for the Northern Ireland national under-23 football team, when he played alongside his brother Bobby in the 1–5 defeat to Wales on 27 February 1963. During the next two years, he played twice more for the under-23 team, scoring three goals for the side. Irvine received his first call-up to the Northern Ireland senior team in April 1963, one month before he made his professional debut for Burnley. He went straight into the team and won his first cap on 3 April 1963 in the 1–4 loss to Wales in the British Home Championship. He received his next cap the following month and scored his first international goal on 30 May 1963 in the 1–1 draw with Spain {{in the first round}} of the 1964 European Nations Cup. It was over a year before Irvine was selected to represent his country again, when he was included in the squad for the 1–2 defeat to Switzerland in a qualification match for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. On 25 November 1964, he scored his second Northern Ireland goal in the loss to Scotland in the British Home Championship. Irvine was involved in his first win with the Northern Ireland team when they defeated the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifying game on 17 March 1965. During the remainder of the 1964–65 season, he won a further three caps for his country.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey's <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> {{playing as}} an {{international}} had come {{while he was at}} Southampton, when he played for England B against Switzerland B in May 1948. He made his full England debut in December that year, in a 6–0 win over Switzerland at Highbury. He briefly lost his England place to his Southampton teammate Bill Ellerington, but following strong performances for Tottenham he returned in England's 2–0 home win over Italy on 30 November 1949. Ramsey's introduction to the England set-up coincided with the team's first ever World Cup campaign, the British Home Nations having rejoined football's world governing body FIFA in 1946 after two decades' absence. They had missed the first three World Cup tournaments in the 1930s. The Football Association in London had moved on little since the modern game's genesis in the late 19th century, yet remained convinced that English football and the England team were the finest in the world—so superior, indeed, that entering the World Cup was hardly necessary. The evidence presented for this was that England had never lost at home to any team from outside the British Isles. The team was picked by a panel of eight FA selectors, with the role of England manager, held by Walter Winterbottom, combined with that of FA director of coaching.|$|E

5|$|Stevenage {{started the}} season poorly, losing 3 {{out of their}} first 4 games and conceding 13 goals in the process, {{including}} a 5–0 loss to Wrexham {{on the first day}} of the season. The club secured its first victory under Westley in late August 2008, a 3–1 win away at Barrow, before winning four games on the bounce in September. However, through the first half of the club's 2008–09 campaign, Westley's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side, losing three games on the trot in November – the last of which was a 2–1 home defeat to Wrexham, it was to be Stevenage's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months. Westley brought in former player, Dino Maamria as first-team coach at the club. This, coupled with important signings during the campaign, such as Chris Day, Mark Roberts, and Jon Ashton, meant that Stevenage witnessed an up-turn in form halfway through the campaign. A 24-game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009, as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season, ultimately meant that Westley's men made the Conference Premier play-offs, finishing in the last play-off place. Despite taking a 3–1 lead into the second leg, Stevenage lost 4–3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United. Westley did, however, enjoy success in the FA Trophy when he led the side out at Wembley Stadium in front of 27,102 as Stevenage beat York City 2–0 in the Final. The win was Westley's <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> success as manager of Stevenage. After the game, it was announced that Westley was to stay on as manager for another year.|$|E
5|$|While {{still at}} high school, Morris was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} New South Wales Second XI against Victoria in January 1939, his <b>first</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> representative cricket. However, Morris made only six and three and did not gain further honours. After finishing his secondary education at the end of 1939, Morris became a clerk in the Prosecutions Branch at Sydney Town Hall. He was chosen to make his debut, aged 18, for New South Wales against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1940–41 season, a season in which there was no Sheffield Shield cricket due to the Second World War. He scored centuries in both innings, becoming the first player in the world to achieve the feat on debut. Morris made 148 in the first innings and participated in a second wicket partnership of 261 with Sid Barnes; he added 111 in the second innings, completing his feat on 28 December. He gave chances that were dropped early in both innings, but impressed observers with his ability to remain settled. New South Wales went on to win by 404 runs. He was unable to maintain the standard of his debut in later performances, but finished the war-shortened season with 385 runs at a strong average of 55.14 in four matches.|$|E
