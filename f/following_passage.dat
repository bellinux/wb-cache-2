5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, {{and continued to}} work with them to draft a final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>passage</b> of the act, {{a series}} of test strikes {{depicting}} Martha Washington were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions. Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design until production began on the gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999. The design was officially retired in 2000, when the Sacagawea dollar entered production.|$|E

5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>passage</b> of the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow {{granted a}} site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the {{construction}} of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was a radical departure from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E
