The research study evaluates the influences of various ship hull parameters in relations to the vessel speeds and level of turbulence (Reynolds number). The modeling was done using MATLAB software and the model test technique based on the ITTC, ATTC, Granville and Hughes friction line application. The result shows that the <b>hull</b> form <b>resistances</b> follow the same trend in the ITTC, ATTC and Granville models, while the Hughes model gave a different trend with other techniques. It further revealed that as the speed increases by 10 knots, the frictional resistance coefficients decrease by 11. 86 % for the ITTC & Granville models, and 12. 03 % for the Hughes model. For Ocean-going Tug and Container Ship, the frictional resistance coefficient decrease by 12. 31 % for the ITTC & Granville models, and 12. 14 % for the Hughes model. The Reynolds number increase by 62. 52 % for every 10 knots increase in {{the speed of the}} Cargo ship and 62. 23 % for every 10 knots increase in the speed of the Ocean going tug and Containership. At various experimental speeds, the results showed that for every 1 knots increase in the speed of the Containership, the effective power developed increases by 9. 45 %. This provides a technical and analytical guide on <b>hull</b> form <b>resistance</b> trend for engineers and ship operators...|$|R

50|$|There is no {{engineering}} {{limit to}} the size of jetboats, though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application. Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about 20 kn, but as boat speed increases beyond this, the extra <b>hull</b> <b>resistance</b> generated by struts, rudders, shafts (etc.) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range (up to 50 kn). Also, in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds (such as tug boats), the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical. For these reasons, the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are main concerns.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} breakthroughs, {{in the development of the}} waterjet, was to change the design so it expelled the jetstream above the water line, contrary to many people's intuition. Hamilton discovered early on that this greatly improved performance, compared to expelling below the waterline, while also providing a [...] "clean" [...] hull bottom (i.e. nothing protruding below the hull line) to allow the boat to skim through very shallow water. It makes no difference to the amount of thrust generated whether the outlet is above or below the waterline, but having it above the waterline reduces <b>hull</b> <b>resistance</b> and draught. Hamilton's first waterjet design had the outlet below the hull and actually in front of the inlet. This probably meant that disturbed water was entering the jet unit and reducing its performance, and the main reason why the change to above the waterline made such a difference.|$|E

The design was good, giving the boats excellent seagoing qualities, fast speed and a light construction, and thanks to their wooden <b>hull,</b> <b>resistance</b> to magnetic mines. The boats only weighed about 30 tons, their length were between 20 and 25 m. The standard armament consisted of one 20 mm automatic cannon, although they could be armed with wide variety of weapons depending of the requirements. The first boat was ordered in December 1929 from U. Suortin Veneveistämö in Helsinki. However, construction of this boat was delayed, and two boats that had been ordered from Germany were ready before the first Finnish one. The following two boats were ordered in January 1931 from Uudenkaupungin Veneveistämö and they were ready by December, the same year. Another order was then placed for one boat from Turun Veneveistämö and it was ready by 1932. A further ten boats were ordered in 1934 from Turun Veneveistämö. These were ready by 1935.|$|E
50|$|Unlike hydrofoils, {{which use}} {{underwater}} wings or struts {{to lift the}} vessel clear of the water, standard jetboats use a conventional planing hull to ride across the water surface, with only the rear portion of the hull displacing any water. With {{the majority of the}} hull clear of the water, there is reduced drag, greatly enhancing speed and maneuverability, so jetboats are normally operated at planing speed. At slower speeds with less water pumping through the jet unit, the jetboat will lose some steering control and maneuverability and will quickly slow down as the hull comes off its planing state and <b>hull</b> <b>resistance</b> is increased. However, loss of steering control at low speeds can be overcome by lowering the reverse deflector slightly and increasing throttle - so an operator may increase thrust and thus control without increasing boat speed itself. A conventional river-going jetboat will have a shallow-angled (but not flat-bottomed) hull to improve its high-speed cornering control and stability, while also allowing it to traverse very shallow water. At speed, jetboats can be safely operated in less than 7.5 cm (3 inches) of water.|$|E
40|$|Fishing boats {{have several}} {{restrictions}} on their machinery arrangements and space utility on deck. For {{the improvement of}} the stability and the deck utility, the fitting of a bulge on sidewall of the vessel is one of the solutions.

25|$|At low to {{moderate}} speeds, a lightweight catamaran <b>hull</b> experiences <b>resistance</b> to passage through {{water that is}} approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading {{to the use of}} wingsails in racing craft.|$|R
50|$|The squat {{effect is}} the {{hydrodynamic}} phenomenon {{by which a}} vessel moving quickly through shallow water creates an area of lowered pressure that causes the ship {{to be closer to}} the seabed than would otherwise be expected. This phenomenon is caused when water that should normally flow under the <b>hull</b> encounters <b>resistance</b> due to the close proximity of the hull to the seabed. Leonardo's law causes the water to move faster in water level (where section is smaller); according Bernoullì's theorem, a velocity increasing determinates a low-pressure area so that ship is pulled down. This squat effect results from a combination of vertical sinkage and a change of trim that may cause the vessel to dip towards the stern or towards the bow.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTWhile {{displacement}} type Deep-V mono hulls have superior seakeeping behaviour at speed, catamarans {{typically have}} modest behaviour in rough seas. It {{is therefore a}} logical progression to combine the superior seakeeping performance of a displacement type Deep-V mono-hull with the high-speed benefits of a catamaran to take the advantages of both hull forms. The displacement Deep-V catamaran concept was developed in Newcastle University and Newcastle University's own multi-purpose research vessel, which was launched in 2011, pushed the design envelope still further with the successful adoption of a novel anti-slamming bulbous bow and tunnel stern for improved efficiency.

50|$|This {{was another}} concept {{introduced}} by Frahm {{and used in}} several ships in the early 1900s. In this concept the two wing tanks are connected only by an air duct at the top. Water flows {{in and out of}} each tank via an opening in the hull to the sea. This eliminates the need for a crossover duct as in the other designs, but has its own set of disadvantages. This design promoted corrosion of the tanks due to the explicit interaction with sea water. The holes on the <b>hull</b> cause <b>resistance</b> to forward motion. The force required to accelerate sea water outside the ship (which is initially at rest) to the speed of the ship as it enters the ship is a substantial drag component (momentum drag) as its magnitude increases with the square of ship speed. More recently, a variation of these tanks has been used in oil drilling rig applications where forward motion is of little relevance.|$|R
