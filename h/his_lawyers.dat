5|$|In 2004 Bamber's defence team, which {{included}} Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully {{to have the}} CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal. <b>His</b> <b>lawyers</b> made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC provisionally rejected Bamber's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> to respond within three months, extended the deadline {{to allow them to}} study all 406 crime-scene photographs, and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry.|$|E
5|$|That April, Voorhees filed a writ of {{attachment}} against Jackalow for unpaid attorney's fees, and the Leetes' executors {{were said to be}} contemplating similar action. The $389 that Jackalow was carrying {{at the time of his}} arrest eventually went to <b>his</b> <b>lawyers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E

5000|$|In 1813 her {{frequently}} absent {{husband who}} was called an [...] "Admiral of Hayti" [...] {{took out a}} case for damages against <b>his</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Fletcher. Her husband said he had sent home £120,000 to <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> and this had been purloined by <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> and moreover he had taken {{his wife and their}} six children. The case went to court and although some of the figures may have been exaggerated Goodall was awarded $5,000 for <b>his</b> <b>lawyer's</b> [...] "criminal conversation" [...] with his wife.|$|R
50|$|In October 2004, Al-Marri told <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{that he had}} {{not been}} interrogated for a year. <b>His</b> <b>lawyer</b> sought to {{challenge}} his detention by a writ of habeas corpus.|$|R
5|$|Binks {{played in}} the Broderick Smith Band in 1988. He was injured in a 1995 car crash at a council {{roadworks}} that left him slightly brain-damaged. A court in 2006 awarded him $330,253 in damages, down from an estimated $750,000 because he {{was said to be}} over the legal limit. Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to <b>his</b> <b>lawyers.</b> A 2007 appeal by the council, saw amount awarded further reduced to $304,750.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or <b>his</b> <b>lawyers,</b> an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
25|$|In early May 2008, it was {{reported}} that the suspect had replaced <b>his</b> <b>lawyer.</b> <b>His</b> former <b>lawyer,</b> Tor Erling Staff, had advised him not to talk to the police. <b>His</b> new <b>lawyer,</b> Gunhild Lærum, recently defended a teacher of similar crimes, and in that case the defendant gave a full explanation of his doings.|$|R
2500|$|Afzali {{denied any}} {{intention}} of aiding terrorism or misleading authorities, and according to <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> he was [...] "caught in a turf war between the NYPD and the FBI."

5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. <b>His</b> <b>lawyers</b> helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, he {{suffered}} a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States. In September 2005, he did not show up for a Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges; the court issued an arrest warrant. <b>His</b> <b>lawyers</b> stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition.|$|E
25|$|During {{his entire}} detention, Mohammed {{has never been}} allowed to meet with <b>his</b> <b>lawyer.</b> The day Mohammed's trial began {{was the first time}} he ever saw <b>his</b> <b>lawyer's</b> face.

5|$|On 4 July 2009, around 20 {{security}} agents {{broke into}} the home of Wang Yonghang. Wang, a Weiquan lawyer from Dalian City, had defended Falun Gong adherents. He {{was taken into custody}} for interrogation and was reportedly beaten severely. Wang's lawyers were not permitted to contact him. In November 2009, Wang was sentenced in a closed court to seven years in prison for his advocacy on behalf of Falun Gong practitioners. When <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> were permitted to see him in January 2010, they reported that he had been tortured.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, a {{grand jury}} was {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; the trial was scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. <b>His</b> <b>lawyers</b> prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid {{in the days before}} the trial.|$|E
5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E

5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail {{awaiting}} trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter to one of <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged {{a letter from a}} supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to <b>his</b> <b>lawyers.</b> Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to his execution, John Allen Muhammad spent time with <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> working out a final appeal to the Supreme Court.

5|$|On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer {{was told}} by Lewis Strauss that his {{security}} file had been subject to two recent re-evaluations because of new screening criteria, and because a former government official had drawn attention to Oppenheimer's record. Strauss said that his clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Given only a day to decide, and after consulting with <b>his</b> <b>lawyers,</b> Oppenheimer chose not to resign, and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that some of what was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|To get to {{the high}} profile Esterbrook, Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells him where to find Claire before she {{can be turned into}} a {{radioactive}} bomb. The FBI storms the building, and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes. Estebrook arrogantly tells Olivia <b>his</b> <b>lawyers</b> will spring him out of any trouble, and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out, causing his company's stock to dramatically decrease in value. After Broyles lectures her, Olivia tells him her emotions (which she had exhibited strongly all episode) make her a better agent.|$|E
