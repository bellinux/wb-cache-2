40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the {{analysis}} of potential use of new materials in the electric furnace <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> and indication of the operating effects for the furnace resulting from their use. The impact of the application of new <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> materials on a total power needed to receive through air cooling system of the furnace hearth was also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Within the frameworks of research, electric furnace operational properties were compiled and a furnace mathematical model {{on the basis of the}} finite element method was created. Based on operational data the created model was calibrated. Analysis of the influence of new <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> materials on the furnace operation was performed. In analysis the change of materials properties resulting from the furnace operation over the years was taken into consideration. Findings: As a result of carried out calculations and analysis the amounts of heat flux transferred, in successive periods of operation, through hearth working layer to cooling installations were acquired. Basing on simulations and calculations, for the above mentioned heat flux, temperatures were calculated on the bottom shell of furnace, in the electrodes axes for different periods of furnace operation. Practical implications: To achieve a decrease in thermal load of hearth it is advisable to reduce thickness of filling material near the vertical wall of furnace and filling the acquired space with new graphite blocks applied to the last layer of hearth. Those information were crucial and had an actual impact on a final design of furnace lining. Originality/value: Carried out analysis have crucial meaning for furnace user, as they allow to predict the probable operation of furnace with new lining materials over the years. This will also make it easier to control the state of lining materials wear and will allow for a better process control...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the heat flows in the blast furnace <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> by {{experimental}} measurements and numerical modeling. Thermocouple data from an operating furnace have been used throughout the work, to verify results and to develop methodologies to use the results in further studies. The <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> {{were divided into two}} zones based on the thermocouple readings: a region with regular temperature variations due to the tapping of the furnace, and another region with slow temperature variations. In an experimental study, the temperatures of the outer surfaces of the wall and bottom were measured and compared with lining temperature measured by thermocouples. Expressions to describe the outer surface temperature profiles were derived and used as input in a two-dimensional steady state heat transfer model. The {{aim of the}} study was to predict the lining temperature profiles in the region subjected to slow temperature variations. The methodology to calculate a steady state lining temperature profile was used as input to a three-dimensional model. The aim of the three-dimensional model was primarily to study the region with dynamic lining temperature variations caused by regular tappings. The study revealed that the replacement of original lining with tap clay has an effect when simulating the quasi-stationary temperature variations in the lining. The study initiated a more detailed study of the taphole region and the size and shape of the tap clay layer profile. It was concluded, that in order to make a more accurate heat transfer model of the blast furnace hearth, the presence of a skull build-up below the taphole, erosion above the taphole and the bath level variations must to be taken into consideration.

40|$|This {{study has}} focused on {{determining}} the heat flows in a production blast furnace hearth. This part of the blast furnace is exposed to high temperatures. In order to increase the campaign length of the lining an improved knowledge of heat flows are necessary. Thus, it has been studied both experimentally and numerically by heat transfer modeling. Measurements of outer surface temperatures in {{the lower part of}} a production blast furnace were carried out. In the experimental study, relations were established between lining temperatures and outer surface temperatures. These relations were used as boundary conditions in a mathematical model, in which the temperature profiles in the <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> are calculated. The predictions show that the corner between the wall and the bottom is the most sensitive part of the hearth. Furthermore, the predictions show that no studied part of the lining had an inner temperature higher than the critical temperature 1150 °C, where the iron melt can be in contact with the lining.

40|$|The {{longevity}} of an iron making blast furnace is largely {{limited by the}} erosion of hearth refractory. The addition of titanium (Ti) -bearing materials into the furnace may promote so-called Ti-rich scaffolds along the damaged <b>hearth</b> <b>lining.</b> A Computational Fluid Dynamics model is used to investigate the complex transport phenomena associated with the formation and dissolution of solid particles. Based on the modeling results, the isotherm of the equilibrium temperature of the incoming hot metal solution {{can be used as}} an indicator for the extent and phase of Ti compounds. It is proposed that the particles can be managed by controlling the location of this isotherm. This can be conducted by either (a) altering the Ti dosage and concentration or (b) altering the hot metal pool temperature. The effects of these parameters on the solids holdup along the hearth refractory linings are investigated. The equilibrium isotherm concept may provide a more suitable way to control the location of Ti-based particles for furnace operators...|$|R

40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} {{is the main}} limitation for a long campaign blast furnace life. An in-depth understanding of the flow and heat transfer is essential {{in order to identify}} the key mechanisms for the hearth erosion. In this study, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model is described which predicts the flow and temperature distributions of liquid iron in blast furnace hearth, and the temperature distribution in the refractories. The model addresses conjugate heat transfer, natural convection and turbulent flow through porous media, with its main features including three-dimensional, high grid resolution and a wide range of geometrical and kinematic scales (from taphole diameter to hearth outside diameter). The melt flow was simulated using improved transport equations, including a modified k-&# 949; turbulence model and a thermal dispersion term. The predicted results show a well-organized flow pattern: two large scale recirculation zones are separated vertically at the taphole level. This flow pattern controls the temperature distribution in the liquid phase, so that the temperature remains nearly uniform in the upper zone, but changes mainly across the lower zone. The effects of several important factors are examined, such as the fluid buoyancy vs constant fluid density, and the shape and position of coke free zone (different shapes of coke free zones were assumed in connection with the reported dissection study). The inclusion of fluid buoyancy was found to be most important for the flow pattern observed. Comparison with the plant data from BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla blast furnaces shows that the pad temperature is most sensitive to the thickness of protection layer in the <b>hearth</b> <b>lining...</b>|$|R

The air, the stirring, and the [...] "boiling" [...] action of the metal helped the oxidizing agents to oxidize the impurities and carbon out of the pig iron. As the impurities oxidize, they formed a molten slag or drifted off as gas while the retaining iron solidified into spongy wrought iron that floated {{to the top of}} the puddle and were fished out of the melt as puddle balls using puddle bars.|$|R
40|$|Generally speaking, a {{blast furnace}} {{is the main}} {{equipment}} in Ironmaking and the campaign life of a blast furnace depends on its remaining <b>hearth</b> refractory <b>lining</b> [1]. The Acousto Ultrasonic- Echo (AU-E) is a stress wave propagation technique that uses time and frequency data analysis to determine coarse-grained material thicknesses, such as refractory and stave materials in operating blast furnaces. A mechanical impact {{on the surface of}} the structure (via a hammer or a mechanical impactor) generates a stress pulse, propagating into the furnace layers. The wave is partially reflected by the change in refractory layer properties, but the main pulse propagates through the solid refractory layers until its energy dissipates. The signal is mainly reflected by the refractory/ molten metal interface, or alternatively by the build up/air or molten metal interfaces that are formed between internal layers or at external boundaries. In this paper, we describe the AU-E technique in details and demonstrate a few results that are indicative of the technique reliability and accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} hearth operation and the factors influencing the total quality of hot metal, especially its carbon and sulphur contents. Regarding the hot metal quality there are many sources of disturbances starting from raw materials, continuing through the blast furnace process and ending the hot metal casting. The carbon content of hot metal {{is an important part of}} the total quality of hot metal. Nearly 80  % of the total reaction energy in the BOF process comes from the oxidation of carbon in hot metal. Therefore, a high and stable carbon content of hot metal is most beneficial. Sulphur in hot metal is known to retard the carbonisation of hot metal. The sulphur content in hot metal is controlled by the sulphur load in the coke and other fuels as well as the slag basicity and low level of unreduced iron oxides. Both carbonisation and desulphurisation are strongly dependent on the hearth operation. To secure a proper hearth operation the hearth coke, the deadman should neither be clogged nor get inactive. Good hearth operation prolongs the campaign life of the <b>hearth</b> <b>lining</b> improving thus the total economy. In this work the factors influencing the hot metal carbon content have been investigated. The carbonisation of solid iron starts in the shaft by CO gas and also by coke carbon when the metal melts down. Hot metal does not get saturated with carbon. The difference between the saturation and actual carbon contents was observed to be around 0. 7  % in average and it increases with increasing sulphur content. The carbon content of hot metal can be maintained on a high level by keeping the sulphur content of hot metal below 0. 05  % which can be attained with a sufficient slag basicity, e. g. CaO / SiO =  1. 2. A progressive vicious circle in blast furnace operation was observed. Problems may start with some disturbance in the hearth operation gradually resulting in low permeability or total clogging of the deadman. The raceways become shorter which leads to a hanging cohesive zone. A hanging cohesive zone transfers insufficiently reduced iron oxides into the slag. Desulphurisation of hot metal weakens due to a higher FeO content in the slag. A high sulphur content in hot metal promotes the precipitation of calcium sulphide. Calcium sulphide together with other compounds with high melting point may clog the hearth further. There are several factors which strengthen vicious circle like a low heat level, an overfilled hearth, too acid slag etc. Different factors influencing the hearth phenomena and start up of the vicious circle including CaS precipitation were observed and analysed in this work. Early warning symptoms of a clogged hearth and methods to identify an inactive deadman were collected. Measures to cure an inactive deadman were developed and practised as well. reviewe...|$|R
