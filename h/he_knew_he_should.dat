6000|$|Alfred {{listened for}} {{the tone of his}} mother's voice; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> judge by that, even without {{catching}} the words--low, subdued, sad--he almost thought she began with 'Yes.' ...|$|E
60|$|Clement saw {{the crisis}} was come which he had long expected, and rejoiced at the form it had taken, though <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> suffer from {{pursuing}} the subject.|$|E
60|$|He went on packing, {{and putting}} {{away with the}} {{different}} garments the unpleasant thoughts that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be sure to unpack with them in Rome; but they would then have less poignancy.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure is}} taking {{stealthy}} steps, {{looking back to}} examine the scene he is leaving. Apparently he is doing something <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be doing, and is attempting {{to get away with}} it anyway.|$|R
5|$|Daniel Trippett as Romeo, a brave, kind, and {{handsome}} Montague and Juliet's love interest. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not go near the Capulets, but he loves Juliet. It is {{revealed that he}} would not let anyone kidnap Juliet; this is first revealed in a shipwreck scene, when an octopus hypnotizes and tangles Juliet and challenges Romeo to a duel.|$|R
5000|$|Clarimonde is {{extremely}} {{looked down upon}} by Father Sérapion, and her fate {{at the end of}} the story shows that she was not worthy of keeping alive. Romuald's constant guilt and fear of his love for Clarimonde shows that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be involved with her; yet his lust and Clarimonde's sexuality outweighs his conscience. Several of Gautier's works have this sort of female archetype. [...] "Omphale" [...] and [...] "Arria Marcella" [...] are both stories involving femme fatale women.|$|R
60|$|The {{heaviest}} load on his mind, {{after his}} conversation with the trader, lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement contemplated,--meeting the importunities and opposition which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have reason to encounter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He--he--I won't tell him!' sobbed the child. 'He's a bad man--he tells stories. He said {{he would}} not hurt me--when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> most terribly. Papa said it was very wrong. Papa was quite angry--he called it deceiving, he did! I won't tell him!' ...|$|E
60|$|Harcourt demurred, {{as he did}} {{not wish}} to be called on imperiously to praise a woman of whom <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> disapprove, and endeavoured to excuse himself from the journey. But Bertram persisted, and at last it was settled that he would go down.|$|E
5000|$|... "Even {{though he}} doesn't {{want it to}} happen, Michael is kind of {{becoming}} a little more human in terms of dealing with relationships. It might not be during the conversation itself; it might be once the conversation is concluded where he kind of realizes that he blew it. In a way, that kind of shows that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have dealt with it differently and he grows from that. Before, he would have walked away from a situation and just not cared. Now he's showing {{a little bit of}} emotion that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> screwed up and all that." [...] Brendan Fehr, from [...] "Roswell: Brendan Fehr" [...] by Edward Gross ...|$|R
60|$|He {{supposed}} {{that the present}} meeting was {{for the purpose of}} inviting him to dine at Philpot Lane, on Christmas Day; and although <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> enjoy the festivity more, at Hackney, he was prepared to accept it very willingly.|$|R
60|$|He kept up heart. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> {{that the}} king was there; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> most likely get justice from the king. If not, he could but {{discover}} himself, and so save his life: for {{that the king}} would kill him knowingly, he did not believe.|$|R
60|$|Here {{they stopped}} for a day in luxurious quarters, and then Jack, after seeing his friend into the train on his way home, started to travel over the Semmering pass down to Trieste, where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find no {{difficulty}} in obtaining a steamer to Constantinople.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} got twenty minutes," [...] said he, {{looking at his}} watch. [...] "But, Susan, tell her what I have said to you. Goodbye." [...] And he put out his hand. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> see her again, but this had been his plan to get her hand in his.|$|E
60|$|The prince {{took his}} leave of me the night before, for, {{as he told}} me, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be met upon the road by several persons of quality, and perhaps by the princess herself; so we lay at two {{different}} inns that night, lest some should come quite to the place, as indeed it happened.|$|E
60|$|When they parted, Bartley {{still found}} himself wakeful. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not sleep {{if he went}} home, {{and he said to}} himself that he could not walk about all night. He turned into a gayly-lighted basement, and asked for {{something}} {{in the way of a}} nightcap.|$|R
6000|$|Considering more intently {{she made}} no answer, and <b>he</b> then <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been {{adequately}} answered by her asking how often he himself had spoken of their terrible friend. Suddenly a brighter light broke in her face and an excited idea sprang to her lips in the appeal: “You have forgiven him?” ...|$|R
50|$|Now it is {{the nature}} of man that when he is hungry he will desire satisfaction, when he is cold he will desire warmth, and when he is weary he will desire rest. This is his {{emotional}} nature. And yet a man, although he is hungry, will not dare {{to be the first to}} eat if he is in the presence of his elders, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> yield to them, and although he is weary, he will not dare to demand rest because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> relieve others of the burden of labor. For a son to yield to his father or a younger brother to relieve his elder brother — acts such as these are all contrary to man's nature and run counter to his proper forms enjoined by ritual principles.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{go to see}} her again, {{according}} to her invitation. Those earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle irreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength. But he could not. He might fast and pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful in him than the Divine.|$|E
60|$|He almost {{expected}} that the goose would be waiting {{for him at the}} stable door when he opened it; but, since <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find his pet in 'the warm box he had made for him, he was not greatly disappointed at not seeing him ready for the journey. Besides, he had come an hour before he told Crippy he would be there, which was sufficient reason why the goose was not ready and anxious to start.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Crawley, you are intoxicated, as usual," [...] replied his wife. And {{the next}} morning, when the Rector woke, {{and called for}} small beer, she put him in mind of his promise to visit Sir Huddleston Fuddleston on Saturday, and as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have a wet night, {{it was agreed that}} he might gallop back again in time for church on Sunday morning. Thus it will be seen that the parishioners of Crawley were equally happy in their Squire and in their Rector.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, sir, you are right. I {{know that}} Harry Merrycourt feels NOW {{that nothing can}} justify rebellion, and that <b>he</b> little <b>knew</b> whither <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be led.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} {{difficulty}} that Carthoris restrained {{the impulse to}} rush forward {{to the side of}} the Ptarthian princess; but in the end his better judgment prevailed, for in the face of such odds <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been but throwing away, uselessly, any future opportunity he might have to succour her.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his older}} brother takes his dad's gun to school to kill himself and his bully, Henry K. Larsen is thrown into a brand new town and a brand new school in order to escape the anger of his old friends and neighbors. In this new town Henry fights to keep {{knowledge}} of the [...] "IT" [...] from tainting his new friends' views of him {{the way it did}} back home. Henry begins to understand what it means to grieve for a loved one who has committed suicide, even through your anger. Through his own experience at school Henry starts to realize the desperate position his brother was in and the impact that bullying had not only on his brother, but on his new friends now. Henry never sugarcoats how he feels and explores the emotions <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, this is {{my second}} journey. I hope I shall come no more. We get a little extra pay and are better fed than we are with the regiment, {{and we have no}} drill; but then it is sad. Last time I had one with me who had left his wife and family behind; he was always sad, he talked to me {{sometimes}} of them, {{there was no one else}} to talk to. He was here for life, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> never see them again. She was young and would marry again." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain De Stancy knew himself conquered: <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{yield to}} Paula--had indeed yielded; {{but there was}} now, in his solitude, {{an hour or two}} of reaction. He did not drink from the bottles sent. He went early to bed, and lay tossing thereon till far into the night, {{thinking}} over the collapse. His teetotalism had, with the lapse of years, unconsciously become the outward and visible sign to himself of his secret vows; and a return to its opposite, however mildly done, signified with ceremonious distinctness the formal acceptance of delectations long forsworn.|$|E
60|$|No {{snow had}} fallen, but {{the sky was}} very thick and a {{stinging}} wind had risen, while he would have trouble in reaching camp if his trail got drifted up. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have turned back earlier, but there was {{what seemed to be}} an extensive wood in front, and he could not face the thought of returning empty-handed to his scanty, unearned supper. The grey trees were not far away; he might reach them and make a mile or two on the back trail before dark, though he was weary and hunger had given him a pain in his left side.|$|E
50|$|The Juniper Tree {{is set in}} Iceland and {{portrays the}} story of two sisters, Margit (Björk Guðmundsdóttir) and her elder sister Katla (Bryndis Petra Bragadóttir), who escape their home after their mother (Guðrún Gísladóttir) is stoned and burned for witchcraft. They go where no one knows them, and find Jóhann (Valdimar Örn Flygenring), a young widower who has a son called Jónas (Geirlaug Sunna Þormar). Katla uses magical powers to seduce Jóhann and they start living together. Margit and Jónas become friends. However, Jónas does not accept Katla as his {{stepmother}} and tries to convince his father to leave her. Katla's magic power is too strong and even though <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> leave her, <b>he</b> can't. Margit's mother appears to her in visions and Jónas' mother appears as a raven and to bring him a magical feather.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> where <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find her. There was a little, low work-room {{adjoining}} {{the kitchen}} {{that was his}} mother's sanctum. There stood her work-basket--there were always piles and piles of work, begun or finished; and there also her few books at hand, to be glanced into in rare snatches of leisure in her busy life.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Raine {{had made}} a good sum of money from selling alcohol. However he was a devout Christian, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> use his wealth for good. He decided to found a school where poor {{children}} could get a free education. He built it in Wapping, where he lived and named it [...] "the Lower School". It opened in 1719.|$|R
60|$|Directly {{after dinner}} he went out, {{and by the}} {{shortest}} path to the allotment lane, telling himself {{he did not care}} if he met Bonover forthwith in the street. He did not know precisely what he intended to do, but he was quite clear that he meant to see the girl he had met in the avenue. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> see her. A sense of obstacles merely braced him and was pleasurable. He went up the stone steps out of the lane to the stile that overlooked the Frobishers, the stile from which he had watched the Frobisher bedroom. There he seated himself with his arms, folded, {{in full view of the}} house.|$|E
6000|$|At last, {{by a great}} effort, {{he forced}} the rusty lock open, and looked eagerly into the strong oak chest. How his heart beat with slow, deep throbs at that supreme moment, not with suspense, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find the money, but with the final {{realization}} of a great hope long deferred! Yes, there it lay, in very truth, all before him--great shining coins of old Spanish gold--gold, gold, gold, arranged in long rows, one coin after another, over the whole surface of the broad oak box. He had found it, he had found it, he had really found it! After so much toilsome hunting, after so much vain endeavour, after so many heart-breaking disappointments, John Cann's treasure in very truth lay open there actually before him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not true?" [...] David asked quietly, and Tommy {{turned from}} him glaring. [...] "I am sorry I spoke of it, {{as it is}} not true," [...] the doctor said after a pause, the crow's-feet showing round his eyes as always {{when he was in}} mental pain; and {{presently}} he went away, after giving Tommy a contemptuous look. Did Tommy deserve that look? We must remember that he had wanted to make the engagement public at once; if he shrank from admitting it for the present, it was because of Elspeth's plight. [...] "Grizel, you might have given her a little time to recover from this man's faithlessness," [...] was what his heart cried. He believed that Grizel had told David, and for the last time in his life he was angry with her. He strode down the hill savagely towards Caddam Wood, where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find her.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you think}} one can't be in earnest without being serious?" [...] Lydia {{suffered}} {{one of those}} silences to ensue in which Staniford had already found himself helpless. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be forced to break it: and he said, with a little spiteful mocking, [...] "I suppose the young men of South Bradfield are both serious and earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know I have not," [...] Dick rejoined, for {{his control}} gave {{way at the}} other's taunt. Lance wanted to make him angry {{and find out how}} much <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> Well, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> find out and Dick thought he would get a jar. [...] "Anyhow, you must stop writing to Evelyn," [...] he resumed. [...] "I'd sooner you kept away from Whitelees when she comes home." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{find the}} lawyer in his office, {{and he opened}} the office door without knocking, and went in. He had not met Squire Gaylord since the morning of his dismissal, {{and the old man}} had left him for the past eight days without any sign as to what he {{expected}} of Bartley, or of what he intended to do in his affair.|$|R
