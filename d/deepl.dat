Penelope outlived many of her spouses and family members. For example, her father and sister Elizabeth died {{consecutively}} leaving her to raise Elizabeth's children. At the young age of 17 Penelope married her deceased sister's husband John Hodgson in 1745. Only two years later John dealving her <b>deepls</b> and her sister's three children. In 1751 Penelope remarried to the wealthy James Craven who was a planter and farmer. When he died in 1755 she inherited all of his estate and became the richest woman in the Province of North Carolina. For the third and final time Penelope married Thomas Barker who was an attorney in Edenton, and 16 years older than her. They had three children who all died before their first birthdays. Mr. Barker sailed to England many times as a representative of North Carolina. In 1933 he journeyed there and was unable to return for many years due to the British blockade of American ships. While her husband was unable to return home from London Penelope managed their estates and home. After Thomas Barker returned in 1778, he and his wife built a home in 1782, which is known today as the Barker House. Penelope outlived her husband by seven years, dying in 1796. She and her husband are buried alongside each other in the Johnston family graveyard at Hayes Plantation, near Edenton.|$|R

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{amorphous solid}} water grown by vapor deposition {{was found to}} depend strongly on the angular distribution of the water molecules incident from the gas phase. Systematic variation of the incident angle during deposition using a collimated beam of water led {{to the growth of}} nonporous to highly porous amorphous solid water. The physical and chemical properties of amorphous solid water are of interest because of its presence in astrophysical environments. The ability to control its properties in the laboratory may shed light on some of the outstanding conßicts related to this important material. Amorphous solid water (ASW) is the most abundant phase of water in astrophysical en-vironments, where it is believed to be a major component of comets (1), planetary rings (2), and interstellar clouds (3).

Teacher-librarians must be {{a mirror image of}} teachers, plus contribute more to the school. This paper examines the characteristics of the work of teachers and teacher-librarians in four major categories: knowledge base; technical skills; personal, interpersonal, and team skills; and values and beliefs. The knowledge base and technical skills, plus new information technology provide new mental models for all teachers. The acceptance of resource-based learning, with its emphasis on life long learning, is consistent with personal mastery, a key discipline of the learning organization. To assume this leadership role, teacher-librarians will have to remain on the cutting edge and must be exemplars of personal mastery. In addition, they need strong personal, interpersonal, and team skills. They will succeed in meeting this challenge only if they are motivated by <b>deepl...</b>|$|E

40|$|In 1967, Alan Westin [1] set {{in motion}} the {{foundations}} of what most Western democracies now think of as privacy when he published his book, Privacy and Freedom. He defined privacy as ”the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, {{and to what extent}} information about them is communicated to others. ” His careful collection of sociological, legal, and historical perspectives on privacy came at a time when people worried that human dignity would erode or that governments would tend toward tyranny, becoming tempted to misuse their newfound power over private data. Computer scientists shared these concerns. Following Westin’s emphasis on privacy as confidentiality, much of the security and privacy research over the last four decades has concentrated on developing more and more robust access control and confidentiality mechanisms. Today, despite the fact that technical innovation in cryptography and network security has enabled all manner of confidentiality control over the exposure of identity in information systems, the vast majority of Internet user remain <b>deepl...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the limitations of}} targeting individual behaviours through information feedback systems without considering the broader socio-technical context in which decisions are made about how people use energy and water. The paper draws on recent research conducted by the author investigating the impact of interactive in-home feedback systems on practices dependent on comfort and cleanliness norms. The research found that although current feedback systems were doing little to challenge bathing, laundering, heating and cooling practices dependent upon these norms, feedback systems could be redesigned to target normative behaviours. This conclusion is made {{within the context of}} previous research on social norms which has found that people {{will be more likely to}} change their behaviours if they are benchmarked against a wider social group and given approval or disapproval for their current behaviours. Previous research shows that personalised feedback can achieve energy and water consumption savings of between 5 - 15 per cent [6].

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We identified 425 individuals, divided into seven categories according to carbohydrate metabolism status (normal glucose tolerance [NGT], impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes) and diabetes duration (0 – 9, 10 – 19, and � 20 years). These categories were examined as ideally describing the natural history of type 2 diabetes development and progression. We measured CD 34 � and CD 34 �KDR � progenitor cells by flow cytometry. We also evaluated progenitor cells in 20 coupled bone marrow and peripheral blood samples and examined progenitor cell apoptosis in 34 subjects. RESULTS — In comparison to NGT, CD 34 � cells were significantly reduced in IGT and had a first nadir in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and a second nadir after 20 years of diabetes.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} refute the {{standard}} interpretation of John Stuart Mill as an inconsistent and incoherent thinker. Traditionally, Mill’s mental ‘crisis ’ of 1826 - 7, {{during which he}} was incapacitated by depression, is taken as clear evidence that he acknowledged the failings of his early beliefs, yet was unable to successfully incorporate his new insights into any form of systematic philosophy. However, Mill himself tells us that he never felt unsettled or conflicted in his beliefs. I argue that common to all of Mill’s writings {{is the notion of}} the formation of character. Mill argues consistently that the individual pursuit of a ‘balanced ’ and ‘noble ’ character will overall be most conducive to maximising utility. This paper aims to demonstrate a systematic and unavoidable connection between Mill’s notion of the formation of character, as initially explained in the System of Logic, and his simultaneous defence of utility in Utilitarianism and of moral and intellectual liberty in On Liberty. These later essays are thus not interpreted merely as the spontaneous ramblings of an inconsistent and confused thinker, but as a legitimate, logical extension of arguments <b>deepl...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study views {{architecture}} and cities {{as part of}} larger urban process that cannot be detached from the larger socio-cultural milieu, and this understanding begs us to delve with broader historical knowledge and deeper geographical understanding. Against conventional framework that espouses abstract economic mapping and hierarchical global city listings to address the locality, stories of Gangnam, a new city south of the Han River in Seoul, will represent emblematic unfolding of urban modernity in South Korea since early 1960 s. The city is a showcase where, in Lefebvre’s expression, “the industrial ” and “the urban ” did not proceed in a sequential order of historical development, but progressed simultaneously and complimented one another under the austere form of national ideology. Here the city illustrates more than its macro-economic spatial narration, and represents the distinctive socio-cultural and political conditions of its formation. Today, epitomizing upper- middle class lifestyle, Gangnam became a synonym for the new urban order where the new exchange value of space was expressed in the soaring price of once government-sponsored mass housings. Representing gradually territorializing urban consciousness, the culture and {{the symbolism of the}} new city strongly supported the consolidation of the fledgling middle class identity. <b>Deepl...</b>|$|E

Happy Birthday Stephen! 1 Crisis and Paradigm Shift Stephen, {{as we all}} know, {{is by far the}} most stubborn and infuriating person in the universe. My own scientific relation with him I think can be called adversarial. We have disagreed profoundly about deep issues concerning black holes, information and all that kind of thing. At times he has caused me to pull my hair out in frustration – and you can plainly see the result. I can assure you that when we began to argue more than two decades ago, I had a full head of hair. I can also say that of all the physicists I have known he has had the strongest influence on me and on my thinking. Just about everything I have thought about since 1980 has in one way or another been a response to his profoundly insightful question about the fate of information that falls into a black hole [1]. While I firmly believe his answer was wrong, the question and his insistence on a convincing answer has forced us to rethink the foundations of physics.

40|$|Should some {{political}} ecology be useful? ” Within many environmental fields {{the answer to}} Blaikie’s (2012) question is painfully obvious; for Political Ecology, it’s just painful. As Blaikie noted many, perhaps even most, Political Ecologists seem to be profoundly ambivalent about helping to craft the natural resource logics, policies, and plans we critique. We may understand {{what is wrong with}} those documents and ideas, but that does not often crystallize into determined engagement in reworking them. What accounts for this common stance of critical but feckless hand-waving? Certainly Political Ecology’s emphasis on complexity makes the distillation of bite-sized policy-ready lessons difficult, but many environmental social and physical scientists routinely distill complex findings into relevant talking points. Perhaps instead it is our commitment to social justice which, paradoxically, prevents us from helping to craft more socially just policy: after spending so much time critiquing the establishment, {{it is difficult to imagine}} joining it. Regardless, Blaikie’s question has sparked a great deal of conversation within Political Ecology about whether more of us can and should engage outside the field, and just what that engagement might look like. I sympathize with essays in this special section that call for a useful Political Ecology (see Baird, Hirsch, and Turner) and find scholars who engage in the long-term, painstaking work of influencing policy and development <b>deepl...</b>|$|E

Why aren’t all the walkers—presumably most citizens but the satisfied minority—making their voices heard? This is the question that haunted me and led me to study the power of sub-truths to block rational understanding. The three general subliminal truths examined in this article have been used to justify: warfare (Pacification, creative destruction, etc.); ethnocentrism (American Exceptionalism); and discrimination (Bloodlines, pure blood, etc.). In different ways, these over-arching themes convey a necessity for purification, and perhaps that is at least partly the reason they often escape critical examination; purification, like humiliation, occupies a sensitive place in the human psyche.

40|$|According to {{the common}} rhetoric of {{software}} process improvement (SPI), {{there are a few}} basic steps to improving your software development process. First, you assess your organization’s current capability to develop quality software. Based on this, you derive a stepwise, focused strategy for improving this capability. You then make im-provement efforts an integral part of your organization’s long-term goals. The result? Both the quality of your services and the productivity of your processes increase. SPI rhetoric is certainly powerful and appealing, and it inspires many software organizations to engage in improvement initiatives. However, even though most or-ganizations struggle to meet expectations, many of them eventually fail. Starting SPI is not difficult. You begin by assessing your current processes. Typi-cally, enthusiasm at this point is high. Most of your colleagues will be eager to learn about the strengths and weaknesses in the way projects are organized and carried out. However, turning assessment insights into action is the point at which many or-ganizations fail. Others manage to initiate focused improvement projects, only to find that implementing new ideas is very difficult (see Chapter 15). Even when you suc-ceed in implementing an idea in an individual project, you are still a long way from institutionalizing improvements. In addition to the predictable challenges at each stage, you’re likely to encounter other challenges. These include conflicts between SPI efforts and other traditional improvement initiatives, and the tendency for re-sources to grow scarce as the first wave of energy for SPI dies out. Clearly, SPI success involves more than simply choosing the right methods and collaborating with the best experts (see Chapter 16). The authors of this book have all been actively engaged in SPI research and prac-tice for several years. Our experiences have taught us what it takes to go from SPI rhetoric to success with actual initiatives. In some ways, SPI’s main goal works against success: SPI seeks to change existing practices.
