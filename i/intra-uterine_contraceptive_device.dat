40|$|The {{aim of this}} discursive {{article is}} to {{highlight}} the challenges for clinicians when diagnosing and treating women with pelvic inflammatory disease, especially when the woman has an intrauterine device in-situ. The article will highlight key areas of the decision making process involved in this specific example and will include discussions on evidence based practice, clinician experience, knowledge base and patient preference. Current clinical guidelines are conflicting on whether an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> should be removed or not when pelvic inflammatory disease is suspected. Research on clinicians found that {{they appear to have}} a relatively low level of knowledge with regards to both pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis, and general <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> use. The importance of patient preference is another factor to consider, with particular focus on potential issues with clinician delivered patient education. Recommendations for future practice, policy and research also will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Pelvic-abdominal actinomycosis {{is a rare}} chronic condition {{caused by}} an anaerobic, gram-negative rod-shaped commensal bacterium of the Actinomyces species. When Actinomyces becomes pathogenic, it frequently causes a chronic infection with granulomatous abscess formation with pus. Due to diversity in clinical and radiological presentation, actinomycosis can easily be mistaken for several other conditions. Peritonitis without preceding abscess formation caused by Actinomyces species has been described in only few cases before in literature. Case report: We report a case of spontaneous pelvic-abdominal peritonitis with presence of pneumoperitoneum and absence of preceding abscesses due to acute actinomycosis mimicking a perforation of the proximal jejunum in a 42 -year-old female with an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> in place. Explorative laparotomy revealed 2 liters of odorless pus but no etiological explanation for the peritonitis. The <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was removed. Cultivation showed growth of Actinomyces turicensis. The patient was successfully treated with penicillin. Conclusions: In the case of primary bacterial peritonitis or lower abdominal pain without focus in a patient with an intrauterine device in situ, Actinomyces {{should be considered as}} a pathoge...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study endocervical swabs from women {{classified}} in three groups were taken. The groups were {{women who had been}} on intra-uterine contraceptive devices for at least two months and experiencing vaginal discharge noticed visibly or through the use of speculum (n= 16); first control subjects which were women who had been on intra-uterine contraceptive devices for at least two months but not experiencing vaginal discharges (n= 14) and a second control subjects which were women who had never been on contraception (n= 2). Candida albicans, Neisseria gonorrhea, Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli were pathogens isolated within the experimental group (n= 16). Lactobacilli and Candida albicans were isolated in the first control subjects (n= 14). No microbial growth was observed within subjects of the second control group (n= 2). Statistical analysis indicated that only 25 % of the experimental subjects showed evidence of infection while 14. 3 % of women within the first control subjects (n= 14) were infected. Since the establishment that infection occurring in less than one month of <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> implant can be meaningfully ascribed to the presence of the <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device,</b> it is recommended that cases of women implanted with intra-uterine contraceptive devices, experiencing vaginal discharges and irritation should be thoroughly investigated before prescription of drugs by physicians...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Actinomycosis is {{a chronic}} granulomatous {{infection}} {{caused by the}} gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, Actinomyces israelli. This paper reviews the etiology and clinical presentation associated with Actinomycosis that often presents as a pelvic mass that mimics a pelvic malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combination of patients treated by the authors {{in the recent past}} and a literature review of patients with pelvic Actinomycosis were assessed for diographic, clinical and predisposing co-factors. An analysis is made of age distribution, gender, diagnostic methods and treatment concepts. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included in the study that included 2 current patients and 31 obtained from literature review. There were 27 fiales (age range 16 - 69 years, mean 38 years) and 6 males (16 - 55 years, mean 36 years). Presenting signs and symptoms were lower abdominal mass in 28 (85 %); lower abdominal pain in 21 (63 %); vaginal discharge or hiaturia in 7 (22 %). Two patients developed fistulae (entero-vesico 1; vesico-cutaneous 1). Nineteen (70 %) of the 27 fiale patients had <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> (IUD). Four patients (12. 5 %) (3 males and 1 fiale) had urachus or urachal rinants. Cystoscopy in 12 patients noted an extrinsic mass effect, bullous edia and in one patient vegetative proliferation proven to be a chronic inflammatory change. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in 32 of the 33 patients who had excision of mass and involved organs. Diagnosis was established by histologic examination of rioved tissue. Penicillin (6 weeks) therapy was utilized to control infections. CONCLUSION: Pelvic actinomycosis mimics pelvic malignancy and may be associated with the long-term use of <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices,</b> and persistent urachal rinants. Rioval of infected mass and antibiotic therapy will eradicate the inflammatory process...|$|R
30|$|Actinomycosis is {{a chronic}} {{suppurative}} granulomatous disease {{caused by the}} Gram-positive bacteria Actinomycoses israelii. This infection rarely involves the pelvis where the main etiological risk factor {{is the use of}} an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> We report on a case of pelvic actinomycosis which mimicked ovarian neoplasia both clinically, radiologically, and surgically. The final diagnosis was made based on the histopathology study of the removed organ. The clinical picture is often non-specific and may suggest ovarian neoplasia. First line treatment is essentially medical, involving prolonged treatment with antibiotics. Additional surgical treatment may occasionally be appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} uterine {{perforation}} are described, occurring 11 days and 4 months, respectively, after {{the insertion of}} GyneFix, a frameless <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> (IUD). In both the cases initial ultrasound scan showed the intra-uterine position of the device. Removal of the IUD, either by laparoscopy or laparotomy, had to be carried out. Awareness of this complication, insertion of GyneFix by a trained operator, appropriateness of ultrasound scan monitoring and possible underreporting of this complication are discussed.

40|$|Background: The bladder {{is one of}} {{the organs}} that an <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> can migrate into because of its close {{proximity}} to the uterus. Its complication of bladder perforation is seldom diagnosed prior to intervention probably {{as a result of its}} rarity. Method: A case report of a Nigerian female who presented with persistent filling-phase lower urinarytract symptoms, haematuria and chronic pelvic pain as a result of a migrated IUCD into the bladder. The device was inserted after uterine evacuation of retained products of conception following an incomplete spontaneous miscarriage with the consent of the husband. It was discovered at cystoscopy, retrieved and she was followed up. Result: The patient was a 29 -year old woman who presented with a 2 -yearhistoryof persistent haematuria, dysuria, and chronic pelvic pain despite several episodes of antibiotic treatment for suspected urinary tract infection. <b>Intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was discovered in the urinary bladderat a diagnostic cystoscopy and was retrieved. Further history revealed that an IUCD was inserted without her knowledge by health personnel immediately after evacuation of the uterus of retained products of conception following an incomplete miscarriage. She recovered without complication within 2 weeks of its removal. Conclusion: This report highlights the need to discourage the insertion of IUCD by untrained health workers and to consider intra-vesical migration of IUCD in women of reproductive age with recurrent or persistent urinary tract symptoms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} Chlamydia trachomatis {{infection}} {{was conducted in}} two stages on 15656 subjects at urogenital clinics of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery at La Sapienza University in Rome, the S. Anna Hospital in Turin, and the Niguarda Hospital in Milan. The overall incidence of the disease was 6. 4 % in patients examined throughout the whole study period. The rate of positive cases was 5. 8 % for the 5270 patients examined up to 1990, and 6. 7 % for the 10386 patients examined from 1990 to 1992, showing an increasing trend. There was a much higher positivity rate in men (9. 8 %) than in women (6. 0 %); the difference was statistically significant. Of all patients, 60 %, were asymptbmatic. In symptomatic patients, C. trachomatis was present in 18. 5 % of cases of non-gonococcal urethritis and in 12. 8 % of cases of salpingitis.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} antioxidant {{status of}} women on four different methods of contraception. Methodology: Sixty non-pregnant women aged 16 - 45 years on oral contraceptive pills, injectables, Norplant and <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> (IUD) attending the Family Planning Clinics of the University College Hospital (UCH) and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan were recruited for the study. Fifty-eight apparently healthy women aged 16 - 45 years who were not on any contraceptive served as a control group. The body mass index (BMI) of all participants (subjects and controls) was determined following standard protocol. Serum levels of ascorbic acid, tocopherol, malondialdehyde, bilirubin, creatinine, uric acid, total protein and albumin were determined using standard spectrophotometric methods. Progesterone was estimated by the chemilumiscence method while selenium was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Results: The BMI was significant in women on oral contraceptive pills (OCP) {{when compared to the}} control group (P 0. 05) in intra-uterine device (IUD), injectables and Norplant users. The mean serum ascorbic acid (P 0. 05) in users of other contraceptive methods. Serum levels of malondialdehyde was significantly elevated in women on OCP (P 0. 05) in users of other contraceptive methods. There was no significant association between progesterone and antioxidants in women on OCP, IUD, injectables and Norplant. Conclusion: Oral contraceptive pills showed a significant decreasing effect on the antioxidant status of its users while IUD, injectables and Norplant did not indicate any significant effect.

40|$|Although Candida albicans is a {{frequent}} inhabitant of the female genital tract, chorioamnionitis is rarely caused by this fungal organism. In this report we present two cases with manifest Candida chorioamnionitis. The first case is a twin pregnancy with premature delivery and survival of both twins. The second case is a pregnancy with <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> in situ ending in a midtrimester abortion, followed by the next pregnancy also ending in an abortion in the second trimester. Possible triggers responsible for the increased invasiveness of otherwise benign Candida vaginitis are discussed. Foreign intra-uterine bodies such as contraceptive devices and cerclage sutures necessitate repetitive search for Candida species infection, and prompt adequate antifungal treatment in cases of documented infection. Both cases of the present report add further substantial evidence to the hypothesis of amniotic infection by ascending transcervical infection. The frequent concomitant cervical infections with other infectious agents as well as antibiotherapy influencing the normal Lactobacillary defence mechanisms are both likely to increase the risk.

Total Fertility Rate of Ethiopia is 5. 4 children per women, population growth rate is estimated to be 2. 7 % per year and contraceptive prevalence rate is only 15 % while the unmet need for family planning is 34 %. Overall awareness of Family Planning methods is high, at 87 %. The prevalence of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods (LAPMs) in Tigray region was very low which accounts for 0. 1 % for implants and no users for <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> (IUCD) and female sterilization.

40|$|Background and aims: Faith-based {{organizations}} (FBOs) {{provide a}} substantial portion of the health care services in many African countries. FBO facilities do consider family planning and reproductive health services as essential to reducing maternal and child mortality, and to the growth of healthy families. Many health facilities, however, struggle to maintain adequate stocks of reproductive health (RH) supplies because of the various RH supply chains and funding sources, which often operate separately from other medicines and supplies. The purpose of this study is to identify the types of supply chain systems used by African faith-based health facilities to acquire reproductive health products (clotrimazole, combined oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive implants, CycleBeadsÂ®, emergency contraception, Erythromycin, female condoms, injectable <b>contraceptives,</b> <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices,</b> magnesium sulfate, male condoms, Methyldopa, Misoprostol, Nifedpine, Oxytocin, and Progestin-only pills), to describe their problems and challenges, and to identify possible corrective actions. Methods: Through email surveys, phone interviews, and on-site visits, we studied the supply chains of 46 faith-based health facilities in 13 African countries. Sixteen RH commodities, including contraceptives, were selected as indicators. Results: Of the 46 facilities surveyed, 55 percent faced stockouts of one or more products in the three months prior to the survey. Stockouts were less common for contraceptives than for other RH products. Significant strengths of the FBO supply chain included creativity in finding other sources of commodities in the face of stockouts, staff designated to monitor quality of the commodities, high capacity for storage, low incidence of expired products, few instances of poor quality, and strong financial sustainability mechanisms, often including patient fees. Weaknesses included unreliable commodity sources and power supplies, long distances to depots, and problems maintaining the cold chain. Conclusions: By studying the supply chains of faith-based health facilities, Christian Connections for International Health (CCIH) and its members have created new awareness among FBOs and international agencies of the importance and challenges of these systems and have suggested actions toward improvement. The Alliance of Christian Faith-Based Organizations for Family Planning (ACFBOFP) formed in Cameroon to strengthen commodity security may be a good model for other FBOs to consider. Cost recovery models with stronger quantification and forecasting systems, including trained staff, can help meet the FP and RH needs of families and can help assure the long-term sustainability of FBO health systems. This study can serve as a frame of reference as we move forward, anticipating an acceleration in interest to strengthen FBO supply chains to reach as many communities as possible with available, quality supplies and services...|$|R
40|$|Unplanned teenage {{pregnancy}} constitutes an important health problem, whilst contraceptive services are free throughout South Africa {{and the number}} of Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) services is increasing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of secondary school girls towards contraception in Thulamela Municipality of Limpopo Province, South Africa. A quantitative descriptive study design was used and respondents were selected by convenience sampling from a population of secondary school girls, the sample consisting of 273 girls in Grades 10 â 12.

40|$|Background: Intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is {{the most}} common method of {{reversible}} contraception in women. The intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> can perforate the uterus and can also migrate into pelvic or abdominal organs. Perforation of the urinary bladder by an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is not common. In West Africa, intravesiâ cal migration of an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> has been rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> migration into the urinary bladder of a 33 year old African woman at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Case report: A 33 year old African woman presented with persistent urinary tract infection of 7 months duration despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a urinary bladder calculus which was found to be an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> on removal at cystoscopy. She got pregnant whilst having the intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> in place and delivered at term.

40|$|Recently, sexually {{transmitted}} diseases {STD's) became the topic of discussion not only in medical journals and social circles, but in Newsweek and Time magazines, and on television shows night and day. These diseases have medical {{as well as social}} rami fications. Syndromes, and end resuJts o f these diseases include: death due to Acquired lmmunne Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), infertility due to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), increas-ed ectopic pregnancies due to increased incidence of salpingitis. Men who are sexual partners of infected women develop urethritis, epididymitis, as well as prostatitis and decreased fertility. Newborns of affected mothers develop conjunctivitis and pneumonia as well as respiratory syndromes. Children of mothers infected with herpes genitalis may develop the same infection and some of them will die of systemic herpetic infection. Pa-tients are advised by their physician to avoid having more than one sexual partner, especially if they are wearing an <b>Intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> (I. U. D.) since it has been proven beyond doubt that multiple sexual part-ners is a risk factor for developing infection followed by infertility in women in general, and in those using l. U. D. 's for contraception, in particular. The current cost of such infections to the economy of the U. S. A. is unknown. The estimated cost is 3 billion dollars for PIO onJy, including both direct and indirect costs. The sexual revolution caused an epidemic of such diseases and all their sequelae with all the frightening com-plications of these infections, especially death.

40|$|Background: Uttar Pradesh (UP) is {{the most}} populous state in India. The {{maternal}} mortality ratio, infant mortality rate, and fertility rates are all {{higher than the national}} average. Sixty percent of UP inhabitants live in rural communities. The reasons behind the poor state of health and services in many areas of UP are inadequate knowledge and availability in communities of healthy behaviors, and information on available government health services. Methods: World Vision, Inc. implemented a three-and-half year mobilizing plan for maternal and neonatal health through a birth spacing and advocacy project (MOMENT), partnering with local organizations in rural Hardoi and urban slums of Lucknow districts in UP. World Vision used print, audio, visual media, and house-to-house contacts to educate communities on timing and spacing of pregnancies; and the benefits of seeking and using maternal and child health services (MCH) including immunization and family planning (FP). This paper focuses on World Visionâs social accountability strategy â Citizen Voice and Action (CVA) and interface meetings â used in Hardoi that helped educate and empower Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) and village leaders to access government untied funds to improve community social and health services. Results: Forty VHSNCs were revived in 24 months. Nine local leaders accessed government untied funds. In addition, increased knowledge of the benefits of timing and spacing of pregnancies, maternal child health, family planning services, and access to community entitlements led the community to embrace and contribute their time to rebuild and re-open 17 non-functional Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) sub-centers. Seventeen ANMs received refresher training to provide quality care. Sub-center data showed that 1, 121 and 3, 156 women opted for <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> and oral pills, respectively, and 29, 316 condoms were distributed. Conclusion: In Hardoi, UP, education using CVA and interface meetings are contributing to {{an increase in the number}} of government sub-centers that integrate contraceptive services with other services such as immunization and antenatal care. This brings care closer and makes it more accessible to women and children, reducing travel time and cost to families who would have otherwise sought these services from higher level facilities. Social accountability can help mobilize communities to contribute to improving services that affect them...|$|E
40|$|Four inter-related {{studies are}} {{described}} which examine a sensitive and little-researched area - contraceptive and cervical cytology services for Asian women. The {{first is a}} questionnaire study of 501 women assessing their contraceptive knowledge, attitudes and usage, and their views on several related topics, including contraceptive and cervical cytology services. The second involves {{a national survey of}} 138 Health Education Units seeking information on the provision and uptake of contraceptive and cervical cytology services for Asian women, and on the availability of relevant health education materials. The third compares the effects of different health education interventions with specially developed Asian language materials upon the uptake of cervical cytology amongst 737 women who have never had cervical smears, and also looks at the women's reasons for non-attendance and their health concerns. The final study attempts to assess the relative risks of cervical dysplasia and neoplasia amongst Leicestershire's Asians and non-Asians and compares 73 Asians who have undergone colposcopy with age-matched non-Asians. There is strong approval for (83 %) and high usage of (70 %) contraception, especially the <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> (33 % of users). In general there is satisfaction with the available contraceptive services (73 %), but the uptake of cervical cytology (32 %) is only half that of the indigenous population. Nationally little is known about uptake of such services by Asians and only a limited amount of health education materials are provided. Personal intervention with a video or leaflet is effective (42 % of respondents subsequently had cervical smears) but written, translated materials by post are not (11 %). Home-viewed videos may be particularly effective in hard-to-reach groups. The mains reasons for non-attendance are lack of knowledge or information (41 %) and fears (36 %). The commonest health concern is racial harassment (66 %). Abnormal results of cervical smears are less common amongst Asians than non-Asians but the annual incidence is increasing in both groups. Older Asian {{women are more likely to}} present with suspicious symptoms and have invasive cancer on biopsy than non-Asians. The studies provide a model to demonstrate how services can be developed on the basis of findings from locally-organised research and have resulted in national distribution of study materials. Recommendations made include the need to attract female general practitioners to inner city areas, the need for further research in other centres to provide comparative data, and the introduction of programmes to assess local needs and consequent provision of services...|$|E

40|$|Background: Use {{of modern}} {{contraceptive}} methods {{has been shown}} to reduce unwanted pregnancy, high parity and maternal mortality. Intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> which are among the safest and most effective reversible contraceptives available, are particularly suitable for women in developing countries as they are affordable, convenient to use, do not require re-supply visits and are very cost-effective. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the socio-demographic characteristics of intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> acceptors, the pattern of insertions and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching hospital, Uyo. Method: The record cards of all clients who had intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> inserted at the family planning clinic over a six-year period were reviewed. Results: During the study period, there were 852 new contraceptive acceptors out of which 39. 7 &#x 0025; accepted the intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> The modal age group of the clients was 25 - 29 years (32. 5 &#x 0025;). Acceptance of intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was most common among multiparous clients (65. 1 &#x 0025;). Majority of the acceptors were married (90. 0 &#x 0025;), Christians (98. 8 &#x 0025;) and 72. 8 &#x 0025; had at least secondary school education. Clinic personnel (65. 7 &#x 0025;) and friends/relatives (21. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common sources of information on contraception. Most (93. 5 &#x 0025;) of the clients had their intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> inserted within 7 days of menstruation.

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess factors associated with utilization of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods (LAPM) among married women of reproductive age group in Mekelle town. Methods A cross sectional community based survey was conducted from March 9 - 20, 2011. Multistage sample technique was used to select the participants for the quantitative methods whereas purposive sampling was used for the qualitative part of the study. Binary descriptive statistics and multiple variable regressions were done. Results The study consisted of quantitative and qualitative data. From the quantitative part of the study the response rate of the study was 95. 6 %. Of the qualitative part two FGDs were conducted for each married women and married men. 64 % of the married women heard about LAPMs. More than half (53. 6 %) of the married women had negative attitude towards practicing of LAPMs. The overall prevalence of LAPMs use was 12. 3 % however; there were no users for female or male sterilization. The main reason cited by the majority of the married women for not using LAPMs was using another method of contraception 360 (93. 3 %). Mothers who had high knowledge were 8 times more likely to use LAPMs as compared with those who had low knowledge (AOR = 7. 9, 95 % CI of (3. 1, 18. 3). Mothers who had two or more pregnancies were 3 times more likely to use LAPM as compared with those who had one pregnancy (AOR = 2. 7, 95 % CI of (1. 4, 5. 1). Conclusion A significant amount of the participants had low knowledge on permanent contraceptive particularly vasectomy. More than half (53. 6 %) of married women had negative attitude towards practicing of LAMPs. Few of married women use female sterilization and none use of female sterilization and or vasectomy. Positive knowledge of LAMPs, women who had two and above pregnancies and women who do not want to have additional child were significantly associated. Information education communication should focus on alleviating factors hinder from practicing of LAPMs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background : The use of long-acting {{reversible}} contraceptive (LARC) methods is {{very low}} in Pakistan with high discontinuation rates mainly attributed to method-related side effects. Mixed evidence {{is available on the}} effectiveness of different client follow-up approaches used to ensure method continuation. We compared the effectiveness of active and passive follow-p approaches in sustaining the use of LARC-and within 'active' follow-up, we further compared a telephone versus home-based approach in rural Punjab, Pakistan. Methods : This was a 12 -month multicentre non-inferiority trial conducted in twenty-two (16 rural-and 6 urban-based) franchised reproductive healthcare facilities in district Chakwal of Punjab province, between November 2013 and December 2014. The study comprised of three groups of LARC clients: a) home-based follow-up, b) telephone-based follow-up, and c) passive or needs-based follow-up. Participants in the first two study groups received counselling on scheduled follow-up from the field workers at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month post-insertion whereas participants in the third group were asked to contact the health facility if in need of medical assistance relating to LARC method use. Study participants were recruited with equal allocation to each study group, but participants were not randomized. The analyses are based on 1, 246 LARC (<b>intra-uterine</b> <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> and implant) users that completed approximately 12 -months of follow-up. The non-inferiority margin was kept at five percentage points for the comparison of active and passive follow-up and six percentage points for telephone and home-based approach. The primary outcome was cumulative probability of method continuation at 12 -month among LARC users. Results : Women recruited in home-based, telephone-based, and passive groups were 400, 419 and 427, respectively. The cumulative probability of LARC continuation at 12 month was 87. 6 % (95 % CI 83. 8 to 90. 6) among women who received home-based follow-up; 89. 1 % (95 % CI 85. 7, 91. 8) who received telephone-based follow-up; and 83. 8 % (95 % CI 79. 8 to 87. 1) who were in the passive or needs-based follow-up group. The probability of continuation among women who were actively followed-up by field health educators-either through home-based visit or telephone-based follow-up was, 88. 3 % (95 % CI 85. 9 to 90. 0). An adjusted risk difference of - 4. 1 (95 % CI - 7. 8 to - 0. 28; p-value = 0. 035) was estimated between active and passive follow-up. Whereas, within the active client follow-up, the telephone-based follow-up was found to be as effective as the home-based follow-up with an adjusted risk difference of 1. 8 (95 % CI - 2. 7 to 6. 4; p-value = 0. 431). Conclusion : A passive follow-up approach was 5 % inferior to an active follow-up approach; whereas telephone-based follow-up was as effective as the home-based visits in sustaining the use of LARC, and was far more resource efficient. Therefore, active follow-up could improve method continuation especially in the critical post-insertion period...|$|E

40|$|Background: Substantial {{evidence}} supports a causal {{relationship between the}} risk of human breast cancer and levels of endogenous estrogens. Aim: To evaluate the urinary estrogen of women on contraceptives and also compare the levels in two different classes of contraceptives; hence, the possible predisposition of such women {{to the risk of}} breast cancer. Setting and Design: Urinary estrogen level was evaluated in 84 women attending family planning clinic in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu, Nigeria, who have been on <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> for 10 years or less (â¤ 10 years). They were aged between 21 and 50 years and were divide into three groups (21 - 30 years, 31 - 40 years, and > 40 years). The control group consisted of 30 age-matched apparently-healthy women who were not on any <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> Materials and Methods: Estrogen was analyzed using EcologeniaÍ¾ Estrogen (E 1 /E 2 /E 3) microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, Batch No. T 2 GR 4, from Japan Envirochemicals Ltd, Japan. Statistical Analysis Used: Significant differences between means were determined by two-tailed Studentâ²s t-test using graph pad prism computer software program. Result: There was a statistically significant increase (P= 0. 0462), in the mean urinary estrogen level of women on contraceptives when compared with the control. The highest amount of estrogen was excreted by the women in the 21 - 30 years age group. When the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>devices</b> were divided into two classes of intra-uterine device and oral/injectables, there was no statistical difference (P= 0. 8112) in the mean urinary estrogen output of the women. Conclusion: The synthetic estrogen content of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> most probably contributed to the level excreted in the urine. The increased estrogen output observed in women on <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was not dependent on the class of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> used...|$|R
