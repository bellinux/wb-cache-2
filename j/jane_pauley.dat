In {{addition}} to interacting with leading contemporary media figures – such as documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, Carl Bernstein and <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley,</b> who presented Ubben Lectures on campus – students have hands-on access to sophisticated media equipment.|$|E
25|$|The first brand {{extension}} of Today {{was created in}} 1982. The early morning news program Early Today was conceived as a lead-in for Today, featuring the same anchors as the main program at the time, Bryant Gumbel and <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley.</b> The half-hour program was fed twice to allow affiliates to carry one or both broadcasts. NBC canceled the program after a year, {{and replaced it with}} NBC News at Sunrise, originally anchored by Connie Chung.|$|E
50|$|Atkins {{appeared}} with Les Paul on television with the Foldaxe on <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley's</b> The Today Show and on Entertainment This Week. Field himself appeared several times on television shows with the Foldaxe, unfolding {{it and then}} playing it amplified. The Foldaxe was reviewed in Industrial Design magazine, winning the Designers' Choice Award sponsored by I. D. Magazine in 1980 for the entire USA. In 1980, noted industrial designer Raymond Loewy sent Field a letter congratulating him {{on the design of}} the Foldaxe.|$|R
5000|$|Palmer officially {{joined the}} Today cast as news anchor on September 27, 1982, {{replacing}} Chris Wallace, who {{had read the}} news and served as Bryant Gumbel and <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley's</b> Washington co-anchor. The team of Gumbel, Pauley, Palmer, Willard Scott, and Gene Shalit helped take The Today Show {{to the top of}} the ratings in 1986, where it stayed until the end of the decade. [...] In the late 1980s, Palmer was the primary substitute co-host of Today on days when Gumbel was away.|$|R
25|$|The 'Diana' {{dress was}} a {{defining}} moment in David Emanuel's career. His profile soared and he became a household name. As well as allowing them to arrange licensing agreements for items such as perfume, linens and sunglasses, David's opinion on fashion and trends was often sought {{and he has been}} interviewed by the main journalists and talk show hosts in Britain and by some in the United States such as Barbara Walters, <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley,</b> Merv Griffin and Joan Rivers.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{announced}} on December 11, 2015 his retirement from television. Today held {{a tribute to}} Scott on his final day featuring tape highlights from his years with the show on December 15, 2015. The plaza outside Rockefeller Center was renamed Willard Scott Way in his honor. A lot of people wished him farewell, including the current Today staff, and former co-anchors Tom Brokaw, <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> and Katie Couric. Others, such as Gene Shalit, and Barbara Bush also bid farewell.|$|E
25|$|The October 18, 1989 {{edition of}} NBC's Today {{that covered the}} {{earthquake}} ran until noon Eastern Time. Bryant Gumbel, <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> and Deborah Norville anchored from Chicago (where they had planned to originally do a special celebratory edition), with reports done by Bob Jamieson and Don Oliver in San Francisco, and George Lewis in Oakland. Jim Miklasewski and Bob Hager covered disaster response from Washington. NBC Sports commentators Bob Costas and Jimmy Cefalo discussed the effect the temblor {{would have on the}} 1989 World Series.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis natives <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> and David Letterman {{launched}} their notable broadcasting careers in local media, Pauley with WISH-TV and Letterman with WTHR-TV, respectively. Motion pictures {{at least partially}} filmed in the city include Speedway, To Please a Lady, Winning, Hoosiers, Going All the Way, Eight Men Out, and Eagle Eye. Television series set in Indianapolis have included One Day at a Time; Good Morning, Miss Bliss; Men Behaving Badly; Cops; Close to Home; the second season of anthology drama American Crime, and HGTV's Good Bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} press only heightened {{after the}} announcement of Pauley's resignation, and Norville was put under a gag order by NBC brass, which prevented her from defending herself from the widespread and erroneous reports that she somehow orchestrated her rise on Today. In January 1990, the new anchor team of Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, minus <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley,</b> debuted with disastrous results. Ratings for the program began to plummet. Critics felt that Gumbel and Norville lacked chemistry and many loyal viewers began turning to rival ABC's Good Morning America (GMA).|$|E
25|$|The program's ratings climbed slowly, but {{steadily}} {{throughout the}} 1970s {{and into the}} 1980s while Today experienced a slight slump in viewership, especially with Walters' decision to leave NBC for a job at ABC News. On August 30, 1976, Tom Brokaw began anchoring Today while the program began {{a search for a}} female co-host. Within a year, Today managed to beat back the Good Morning America ratings threat with Brokaw and new co-host <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley,</b> featuring art and entertainment contributor Gene Shalit. Good Morning America continued to threaten Todays ratings dominance into the 1980s, especially after Brokaw left the latter program to become co-anchor of NBC Nightly News with Roger Mudd for 17 months before being named sole anchor of that program. For the first time, Good Morning America became the highest-rated morning news program in the United States as Today fell to second place.|$|E
25|$|Ann Curry's final show as co-anchor was subdued {{compared}} to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira, as it did not include retrospectives of Curry's 15-year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry's departure from Today began weeks before NBC formally announced that she {{would no longer be}} co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as since disproven reports suggested that Matt Lauer had a hand in the program's decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer's alleged involvement in Curry's departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing Good Morning America, which toppled Todays 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Associated Press.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1989, Norville {{was named}} news anchor on Today. [...] Soon after, Today co-host <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> {{announced}} {{her desire to}} leave the Today Show, and Norville was named her successor. [...] Pauley went on to host a primetime show, Real Life with <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley.</b> [...] Norville became co-host of Today in January 1990. [...] During her tenure on Today, she won an Emmy award {{for her role in}} NBC’s coverage of the democratic uprising in Romania. [...] Ratings on Today declined after Norville’s arrival. [...] NBC management was accused of mishandling the transition. [...] One insider told People magazine, “NBC handled the whole situation in a very poor manner. [...] I don’t think she (Deborah) blames anyone in particular. [...] I just think she feels the situation was handled unprofessionally – in an undignified manner for both her and Jane.” [...] After Norville took maternity leave on the birth of her first child, she did not return to the program.|$|E
2500|$|Trudeau married <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> in 1980; {{they have}} three children. He {{maintains}} a low personal profile. A rare early appearance on television was as a guest on To Tell the Truth in 1971, where {{only one of the}} three panelists guessed his identity. In 1990, Trudeau appeared on the cover of Newsweek for Inside Doonesbury's Brain, a story written by Jonathan Alter. This was the first interview Trudeau had given in seventeen years.|$|E
2500|$|Couric joined NBC News in 1989 as Deputy Pentagon Correspondent. From 1989 to 1991, Couric was {{an anchor}} substitute. [...] She filled in for Bryant Gumbel {{as host of}} Today, <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley,</b> and Deborah Norville as co-anchor of Today, Garrick Utley, Mary Alice Williams, and Maria Shriver as co-host of Sunday Today, and John Palmer, Norville, and Faith Daniels as anchor of the former NBC News program NBC News at Sunrise. She also subbed for Daniels, Norville, and John Palmer as the news anchor on Today.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Deborah Norville (then {{anchor of}} the network's early-morning news {{program at the}} time, NBC News at Sunrise) {{replaced}} John Palmer at the Today newsdesk, at which point he assumed her previous role on Sunrise. She also began substituting for Tom Brokaw on NBC Nightly News. Shortly after Norville's appointment as Todays news anchor, {{the decision was made}} to feature her as an unofficial third host. Whereas Palmer had read the news from a desk separate from where Gumbel and Pauley sat, Norville was seated alongside the program's hosts at the opening and closing of every show. Before long, gossip columns and media observers predicted that NBC would remove <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> from the program and replace her with Norville in an effort to improve the program's recently declining viewership among young women, the demographic most coveted by morning shows. During this period, Saturday Night Live featured a sketch titled [...] "All About Deborah Norville" [...] (a takeoff on the classic film All About Eve), which depicted Norville as ruthlessly scheming to take Pauley's place as Today co-host.|$|E

5000|$|Real Life with <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> was a newsmagazine {{television}} program aired in the United States by NBC from 1990 to 1991. Real Life with <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> {{seemed to be}} presented as an answer to both critics {{and members of the}} general public to the frequently-repeated viewpoint that [...] "television news never seems to show anything positive". Real Life focused on positive, human interest-type stories and occasional celebrity profiles. <b>Jane</b> <b>Pauley</b> also presented less uplifting but still-lightweight features as well, such as a feature focusing on how less than 20% of the people who owned VCRs at the time actually knew how to program them. Boyd Matson was also featured as a correspondent; his reports featured stories on out of the way places.|$|E
