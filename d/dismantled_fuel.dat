40|$|Operational {{critical}} assemblies {{are subject}} to the same standards of materials control and accountability (MC and A) as other fissile materials. Typically these assemblies are not easily <b>dismantled</b> and the <b>fuel</b> components cannot be inventoried by traditional methods of destructive or non-destructive materials assay. Because of the large mass or unusual geometry of the fuel components these parts are often categorized as difficult-to-measure (DTM) items. The use of criticality to infer fissile inventory, in conjunction with physical security and two-person control procedures, provides accurate and cost-effective MC and A for these large critical assembly components. This method is being implemented at the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF) and at several national nuclear research centers in Russia...|$|R
40|$|The {{fuel cell}} {{laboratory}} {{was constructed in}} three phases and taken into operation in the years 1962 to 1966. The last experimental work {{was carried out in}} 1996. After all cell internals had been disassembled, the fuel cell laboratory was transferred to shutdown operation in 1997. Three cell complexes, which differed, in particular, by the type of shielding (lead, cast steel, concrete), were available until then for activities at nuclear components. After approval by the regulatory authority, the actual <b>dismantling</b> of the <b>fuel</b> cell laboratory started in March 2000. The BZ I laboratory area consisted of 7 cells with lead shieldings of 100 to 250 mm thickness. This area was dismantled from April to September 2000. Among other things, approx. 30, 000 lead bricks with a total weight of approx. 300 Mg were dismantled and disposed of. The BZ III laboratory area essentially consisted of cells with concrete shieldings of 1200 to 1400 mm thickness. The dismantling of this area started in the fir st half of 2001 and was completed in November 2002. Among other things, approx. 900 Mg of concrete was dismantled and disposed of. Since more than 90 % of the dismantled materials was measurable for clearance, various clearance measurement devices were used during dismantling. The BZ II laboratory area essentially consists of cells with cast steel shieldings of 400 to 460 mm thickness. In September 2002 it was decided to continue using this laboratory area for future tasks. The <b>dismantling</b> of the <b>fuel</b> cell laboratory was thus completed. After appropriate refurbishment, the fuel cell laboratory will probably take up operation again in late 2003...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a possible solution for the designing of a device for the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The decommissioning activities are dismantling, demolition, controlled removal of equipment, components, conventional or hazardous waste (radioactive, toxic) in compliance with the international basic safety standards on radiation protection. One as the most important operation in the final phase of the nuclear reactor dismantling is the decommissioning of fuel channels. For the fuel channels decommissioning should be taken into account the detailed description of the fuel channel and its components, the installation documents history, adequate radiological criteria for decommissioning guidance, safety and environmental impact assessment, including radiological and non-radiological analysis of the risks that can occur for workers, public and environment, the description of the proposed program for decommissioning the fuel channel and its components, the description of the quality assurance program and of the monitoring program, the equipments and methods used to verify the compliance with the decommissioning criteria, the planning of performing the final radiological assessment at the end of the fuel channel decommissioning. These will include also, a description of the proposed radiation protection procedures to be used during decommissioning. The <b>dismantling</b> of the <b>fuel</b> channel is performed by one device which shall provide radiation protection during the stages of decommissioning, ensuring radiation protection of the workers. The device shall be designed according to the radiation protection procedures. The decommissioning device assembly of the fuel channel components is composed of the device itself and moving platform support for coupling of the selected channel to be <b>dismantled.</b> The <b>fuel</b> channel decommissioning device is an autonomous device designed for dismantling and extraction of the channel closure plug and shield plug, extraction of the end fitting, cutting and extraction of the pressure tube. The fuel channel decommissioning device consists of following major components: coupling and locking fuel channel module, assembly valve for access to the fuel channel, storage tubes assembly for extracted components, handling elements assembly, cutting and extraction device and housing device.

50|$|The areas {{affected}} {{were home}} to 4.5 million people. Butter disappeared after October 1944, shortly after railway transport {{to the western}} parts of the Netherlands had stopped in September due to the railway strike. The supply of vegetable fats dwindled to a minuscule seven-month supply of 1.3 liters per person. At first 100 grams of cheese were allotted every two weeks; the meat coupons became worthless. The bread ration had already dropped from 2,200 to 1,800 and then to 1,400 grams per week. Then it fell to 1,000 grams in October, and by April 1945 to 400 grams a week. Together with one kilogram of potatoes, this then formed the entire weekly ration. The black market increasingly ran out of food as well, and with the gas and electricity and heat turned off, everyone was very cold and very hungry. In search of food, young strong people would walk for tens of kilometers to trade valuables for food at farms. Tulip bulbs and sugar beets were commonly consumed. Furniture and houses were <b>dismantled</b> to provide <b>fuel</b> for heating.|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t PHWR fuel bundles are {{required}} to be dismantled for inspection the individual pins under highly radioactive environment of the hot cell. PHWR fuel bundle consists of 19 tubular pins, spot-welded to two end plates (tie plates) on each side. It is of about 14. 5 mm diameter and 495 mm long.

Based on the feasibility studies, a design for totally automatic and remotely operable system has been made and is proposed to be used for <b>dismantling</b> of PHWR <b>fuels</b> inside the hot cell. The system has to perform operations like moving the bundle to laser cell from charging cask, cutting both the end plates using laser to separate out 19 pins for examinations and finally chopping of each pin for dissolution of the fuel for further processing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGamma {{emission}} tomography {{is a method}} based on gamma-ray spectroscopy and tomographic reconstruction techniques, {{which can be used}} for rod-wise characterization of nuclear <b>fuel</b> assemblies without <b>dismantling</b> the <b>fuel.</b> By performing a large number of measurements of the gamma-ray flux intensity around a fuel assembly using a well-collimated gamma-ray detector, the internal source distribution in the assembly may be reconstructed using tomographic algorithms. If a spectroscopic detection system is used, different gamma-ray emitting isotopes can be selected for analysis, enabling nondestructive fuel characterization with respect to a variety of fuel parameters. In this paper, we describe a novel gamma {{emission tomography}} instrument, which has been designed, constructed and tested at the Halden Boiling Water Reactor (HBWR). The device will be used to characterize fuel assemblies irradiated in the HBWR as part of ongoing nuclear fuel research conducted within the OECD Halden Reactor Project (HRP). As compared to single-rod gamma scanning, where the <b>fuel</b> is <b>dismantled</b> and the gamma radiation from each rod is measured separately, handling time associated with characterizing the fuel can be significantly reduced when using the gamma emission tomography device. Furthermore, because gamma emission tomography enables rod-wise <b>fuel</b> characterization without <b>dismantling,</b> even instrumented experimental fuel assemblies may be characterized repeatedly throughout the fuel’s lifetime, with limited risk of damaging the fuel or its instrumentation. Accordingly, the capabilities of fuel characterization within the OECD HRP are expected to be strongly enhanced by the deployment of this device. Here, the gamma-tomographic method and the experimental setup are demonstrated through experimental measurements of the fuel stack and gas plenum regions of a nine-rod HBWR fuel assembly configuration, where four rods had a burnup of approximately 26 MWd/kgUO 2 and five rods had a burnup of approximately 50 MWd/kgUO 2. Tomographic images are presented, which show the applicability for assessment of fission gas contents in the gas plena and of fission products in the fuel stack. Furthermore, neutron activation products are analyzed, which give additional information on construction material properties...|$|R

40|$|Decommissioning of {{a nuclear}} {{facility}} comprises not only actual dismantling but also, above all, management of the resulting residual materials and waste. Siemens Decommissioning Projects (DP) in Hanau {{has been involved in}} this task since 1995 when the decision was taken to decommission and <b>dismantle</b> the Hanau <b>Fuel</b> Fabrication Plant. Due to the decommissioning, large amounts of contaminated steel scrap have to be managed. The contamination of this metal scrap can be found almost exclusively in the form of surface contamination. Various decontamination technologies are involved, as there are blasting and wiping. Often these methods are not sufficient to meet the free release limits. In these cases, SIEMENS has decided to melt the scrap at Siempelkamp's melting plant. The plant is licensed according to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance Section 7 (issue of 20. 07. 2001). The furnace is a medium frequency induction type with a load capacity of 3. 2 t and a throughput of 2 t/h for steel melting. For safety reasons, the furnace is widely operated by remote handling. A highly efficient filter system of cyclone, bag filter and HEPA-filter in two lines retains the dust and aerosol activity from the off-gas system. The slag is solidified at the surface of the melt and gripped before pouring the liquid iron into a chill. Since 1989, in total 15, 000 t have been molten in the plant, 2, 000 t of them having been contaminated steel scrap from the decommissioning of fuel fabrication plants. Decontamination factors could be achieved between 80 and 100 by the high affinity of the uranium to the slag former. The activity is transferred to the slag up to nearly 100 %. Samples taken from metal, slag and dust are analyzed by gamma measurements of the 186 keV line of U 235 and the 1001 keV line of Pa 234 m for U 238. All produced ingots showed a remaining activity less than 1 Bq/g and could be released for industrial reuse...|$|R
