5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> privileged and to cope with the influx of immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher.

25|$|Terrorism {{is after}} all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus {{effectively}} nonsensical.

This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} Goldmund in {{the book}} Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse serves as an apprentice with a master sculptor who is socially prominent in the town where he worked and whose character appears to be loosely based on that of Riemenschneider.

His departure weakened the hardliners in the cabinet who were opposed to negotiating with the Irish Republican Army, and the Anglo-Irish War ended in the summer.|$|E
25|$|KCN {{is used as}} a {{photographic}} fixer in the wet plate collodion process. The KCN dissolves silver where it has not been made insoluble by the developer. This reveals and stabilizes the image, making it no longer sensitive to light. Modern wet plate photographers may prefer less toxic fixers, often opting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> toxic Sodium thiosulphate, but KCN is still used. Also used as snake repellent by Koreans.|$|E

25|$|The report {{considered}} 15 and 30 minute headways. Travel {{time with}} two intermediate stops would be eight minutes between Alna and Storo. Half-hour services could be operated {{with a single}} multiple unit and still allow to freight trains to operate per hour. Fifteen-minute services would require three units and require the line to expanded to double track. Infrastructure upgrades were estimated to 241 million Norwegian krone (NOK) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> frequent service and NOK572 million for the more frequent service.
