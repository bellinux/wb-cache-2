40|$|The {{qualitative}} research {{reported in this}} study draws on sense of place theory {{to develop a new}} approach to evaluating interpretation. In this thesis I argue that interpretation, either explicitly or implicitly, aims to stimulate, facilitate and extend people's understanding of place so that empathy towards heritage, conservation, culture and landscape can be developed. A new approach is used to explore how effectively interpretation influences people's understanding of place at Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand. A typology of <b>interpretive</b> <b>provision</b> is developed which identifies three forms of interpretation - primary, secondary and tertiary. Each form of interpretation reveals the place in a different form and manner. Visitors to the national park are classified into four groups depending on their use of this range of interpretation. These categories are termed; seekers, stumblers, shadowers and shunners. By moving the majority of these visitor groups (even short stay visitors) towards an appreciation of the place, the interpretation at Mount Cook is deemed effective in achieving its aims. A number of other tangible and intangible factors are also identified as contributing to the development of visitors' appreciation of place. The case is made for a more theory driven approach to the evaluation of interpretation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of growing {{pressure}} placed on the natural environment, the study on which {{this article is based}} considered the effectiveness of <b>interpretive</b> <b>provision</b> in mitigating the harmful effects of tourism on the environment. The aim of this research was to determine whether guided or non-guided interpretation is most effective in reaching the stated goals of interpretation. The four key goals of interpretation, namely visitor satisfaction, knowledge gain, attitude change and modification of behaviour intent, were used in the assessment of the relative effectiveness of guided and non-guided interpretation in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Through comparing responses to questionnaires from post-visit samples and observing both guided and non-guided interpretation, the research found that guided interpretation was only marginally more effective in reaching the four key goals of interpretation than the non-guided interpretive media. Guided interpretation was found to be more effective in terms of visitor satisfaction, whilst guided and non-guided interpretation had only marginal differences in effectiveness in relation to knowledge gain, attitude change and intent to modify behaviour. Conservation implications: The necessity of implementing an appropriate interpretation programme within protected areas cannot be overemphasised. The interpretation programme should be designed to include elements of both guided and non-guided interpretation in order to achieve a predetermined goal. The effectiveness of the programme should be evaluated periodically and amended where appropriate. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lifelong Learning {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{which includes}} {{many different kinds of}} provision and different forms of learning. At its heart is formal learning, often classroom based, or involving paper and electronic media, undertaken within educational institutions such as colleges and universities. It may or may not lead to an award and it includes learning undertaken for vocational reasons as well as for general interest. It encompasses what are sometimes also known as adult education, continuing education, continuing professional development (cpd), vocational training and the acquisition of basic skills. It may also include work-based learning, and may overlap with post compulsory (post 16) education, i. e. with further education and higher education, but normally applies to all ‘adult learning’ i. e. by people over the age of 19, in particular those who are returning to study after completing their initial education. From the perspective of the individual learner, however, non-formal learning (organised, systematic study carried on outside the framework of the formal system) is also important. This forms a continuum with informal learning that occurs frequently in the process of daily living, sometimes coincidentally for example through information media or through <b>interpretive</b> <b>provision</b> (such as at museums or heritage sites). This report focuses on those aspects of adult learning which are directly affected by government policies, and thus of prime concern for rural proofing. ...|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 {{sets out}} {{the rights and}} freedoms of anyone subject to New Zealand law, and {{is part of the}} country's uncodified constitution. The act protects {{fundamental}} rights and freedoms in New Zealand society in a general, rather than absolute, sense. When an act is prima facie inconsistent with a right or freedom contained in the Bill of Rights, the starting point for that act's application is to examine that meaning against the guaranteed right to see if the right is curtailed. If so, the Bill of Rights’ <b>interpretive</b> <b>provisions</b> (sections 4, 5 and 6) are engaged.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} interpretive {{provisions in}} human rights legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand and two Australian jurisdictions: the Australian Capital Territory and the State of Victoria. It deals with the relationship between certain common law interpretive principles which protect {{human rights and the}} rules under the interpretive provisions. It also considers what effect the interpretive provisions have on the overall approach to statutory interpretation, particularly in terms of their impact on the roles of intention and purpose. One of the themes of the thesis is {{that it is possible to}} identify a common methodology for the application of the various interpretive provisions. This is facilitated by an emphasis on the concept of purpose, which is flexible and capable of being identified and applied at higher levels of abstraction than the concept of intention as commonly applied by the courts. Despite this common methodology, the results of attempts at legislative rights-consistent interpretation in the relevant jurisdictions differ. We shall see that the UK courts have taken a broader interpretive approach than have their New Zealand and Australian counterparts. This will be explained by reference to the respective contexts of the human rights legislation in each jurisdiction, particularly in terms of legislative history. It will be argued that the purpose of the UK legislation to provide remedies in domestic courts for breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights provides the basis for the UK courts’ approach. The absence of this factor is the primary point of distinction between the UK on the one hand, and New Zealand and Australia on the other, though other issues will be explored. Finally, while as a matter of the interpretation of the UK legislation, and especially of the relevant <b>interpretive</b> <b>provision,</b> the approach of the UK courts is defensible, the significant risk to the principle of legal certainty which it poses will be highlighted. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
