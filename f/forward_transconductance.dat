The number of surface states and the density of states per unit energy have been deduced from the <b>forward</b> <b>transconductance.</b> It {{has been found that}} some dielectrics introduce a large number of surface states {{near the center of the}} bandgap. The protection of the surface of the active volume of germanium detectors for infrared light,-/-radiation, or particles is a problem which differs in many respects from the surface passivation problem in the silicon transistor or integrated circuit technology. The solu-tions developed for the latter canot be applied to these Ge devices for a var iety of reasons. The main one i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The paper proposes an easy {{extraction}} path {{of almost}} static and dynamic parameters {{of a power}} MOSFET based on a laboratory technique that requires only one test circuit. Hard switching the power MOSFET on a resistive load, the gate charge, the <b>forward</b> <b>transconductance,</b> the on-state resistance and the switching times, and the intrinsic capacitances are extracted from the waveforms of the gate voltage, drain voltage, and drain current. The extraction procedure for all these parameters of device is described step by step in the paper. A simple test allows students to evaluate the switching performance of a power MOSFET and to teach the difference between MOSFET technologies comparing the Figure of Merit (FOM) index of devices. This test can be repeated for many MOSFETs and IGBTs to compare their overall switching performance and to observe the device behavior for various operating conditions of the device under test (resistive or inductive loads and different supply voltages, and drive gate currents) {{and it can be}} used as an education tool in Power Electronics at its basic level...|$|E
