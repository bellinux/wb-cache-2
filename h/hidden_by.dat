5|$|At the {{beginning}} of direct American involvement in World War II, the U.S. government bought the building and converted it to federal offices, officer billets, spaces used by the Army's Ordnance Procurement department, a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board. The high vaulted ceiling of the Great Hall worship center was <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> a dropped ceiling. After the war, the Internal Revenue Service moved offices into the building.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. The African crake is less skulking {{and easier to}} flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen {{at the edges of}} roads and tracks, but the corn crake is a much more difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> vegetation and rarely emerging into the open. Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings, flanks and belly like a fan. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The painting was <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, an Apple II {{software}} cracker {{team found}} an Easter egg <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations {{screen in the}} game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the problems of}} capacity, the National Stadium was also very well <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.|$|E

5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be the {{daughter}} of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable Manchester Square. In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, Alberto Matxain Beraza {{was arrested}} in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy, next to the French Alps. He was held along with fellow ETA members Aitzol Etxaburu and Andoni Sarasola. They were {{responsible}} for ETA’s logistics operation, and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the ETA cells operating in Spanish soil. The arrest led {{to the discovery of}} almost a tone of explosives, <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> ETA in 12 small caches around France.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 May, both sides located each other {{at about the same}} time and began {{launching}} their aircraft about 09:00. The American dive bombers disabled Shōkakus flight deck with three hits, but the carrier was able to evade all of the torpedoes. <b>Hidden</b> <b>by</b> a rain squall, Zuikaku escaped detection and was not attacked. In return, the Japanese aircraft badly damaged Lexington with two torpedo and two bomb hits and scored a single bomb hit on Yorktown. The torpedo hits on Lexington cracked one of her avgas tanks, and leaking vapor caused a series of large explosions that caused her to be scuttled.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army {{took away}} his ashes {{to prevent a}} {{memorial}} from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had been <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> {{the owner of the}} crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to this day. In 1978, all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year.|$|E
5|$|The magma {{intrusion}} rate below Uturunku {{is considerably}} {{larger than the}} magma output of the Pleistocene volcano, being comparable to the magma flux of historic eruptions and estimates of magma generation rates in local caldera forming magma chambers. Evidence {{for the formation of}} such a magma chamber is elusive but might be <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the deformation activity of the APVC melt generation zone. Uturunku may be developing into a supervolcano, and a caldera forming super-eruption may occur there; this possibility has resulted in international media attention.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the facade (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central niche.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were <b>hidden</b> <b>by</b> the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E

A previous data hiding method, the Data <b>Hiding</b> <b>by</b> Pair-Toggling (DHPT), is reasonably good but introduce considerable visual artifacts. In this paper, we analyze {{the sources of the}} artifacts in DHPT and propose an improvement by using smart pair toggling. Simulation results suggest that the proposed Data <b>Hiding</b> <b>by</b> Smart Pair-Toggling (DHSPT) algorithm can hide the same amount of data while generating halftone images with considerably better visual quality than DHPT...|$|R

In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England, staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States. A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by {{an agent of the}} United States in Egypt in November 1866.|$|E
