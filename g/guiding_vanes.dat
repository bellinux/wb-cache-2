The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of steady RANS and the RNG k-e model for this application and (2) to assess the magnitude of the underpressures generated with different design configurations of the venturi-shaped roof. The CFD simulations of mean wind speed and surface pressures inside the roof are generally in good agreement (10 - 20 %) with the wind tunnel measurements.

The comparison of design configurations with and without <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes</b> shows an – at least at first sight – counter-intuitive result: adding <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes</b> strongly decreases the absolute value of the underpressure.

The three-dimensional time-averaged incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are adopted to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a tubular pump with fixed and adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively.

40|$|In {{power plants}} using large utility {{coal-fired}} boilers for {{generation of electricity}} the coal is pulverised in coal mills and then {{it has to be}} pneumatically transported and distributed to a larger number of burners (e. g. 30 - 40) circumferentially arranged in several rows around the burning chamber of the boiler. Besides the large pipework flow splitting devices are necessary for distribution of an equal amount of pulverised fuel (PF) to each of the burners. So called trifurcators (without inner fittings or <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes)</b> and ''riffle'' type bifurcators are commonly used to split the gas-coal particle flow into two or three pipes/channels with an equal amount of PF mass flow rate in each outflow cross section of the flow splitting device. These PF flow splitting devices are subject of a number of problems. First of all an uneven distribution of PF over the burners of a large utility boiler leads to operational and maintenance problems, increased level of unburned carbon and higher rates of NOX emissions. Maldistribution of fuel between burners caused by non uniform concentration of the PF (particle roping) in pipe and channel bends prior to flow splitting devices leads to uncontrolled differences in the fuel to air ratio between burners. This results in localised regions in the furnace which are fuel rich, where insufficient air causes incomplete combustion of the fuel. Other regions in the furnace become fuel lean, forming high local concentrations of NOX due to the high local concentrations of O 2. Otherwise PF maldistribution can impact on power plant maintenance in terms of uneven wear on PF pipework, flow splitters as well as the effects on boiler panels (PF deposition, corrosion, slagging). In order to address these problems in establishing uniform PF distribution over the outlet cross sections of flow splitting devices in the pipework of coal-fired power plants the present paper deals with numerical prediction and analysis of the complex gas and coal particle (PF) flow through trifurcators and ''riffle'' type bifurcators. The numerical investigation is based on a 3 -dimensional Eulerian- Lagrangian approach (MISTRAL/PartFlow- 3 D) developed by Frank et al. The numerical method is capable to predict isothermal, incompressible, steady gas- particle flows in 3 -dimensional, geometrically complex flow geometries using boundary fitted, block-structured, numerical grids. Due to the very high numerical effort of the investigated gas-particle flows the numerical approach has been developed with special emphasis on efficient parallel computing on clusters of workstations or other high performance computing architectures. Besides the aerodynamically interaction between the carrier fluid phase and the PF particles the gas-particle flow is mainly influenced by particle-wall interactions with the outer wall boundaries and the inner fittings and <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes</b> of the investigated flow splitting devices. In order to allow accurate quantitative prediction of the motion of the disperse phase the numerical model requires detailed information about the particle-wall collision process. In commonly used physical models of the particle-wall interaction this is the knowledge or experimental prediction of the restitution coefficients (dynamic friction coefficient, coefficient of restitution) for the used combination of particle and wall material, e. g. PF particles on steel. In the present investigation these parameters of the particle-wall interaction model have been obtained from special experiments in two test facilities. Basic experiments to clarify the details of the particle-wall interaction process were made in a test facility with a spherical disk accelerator. This test facility furthermore provides the opportunity to investigate the bouncing process under normal pressure as well as under vacuum conditions, thus excluding aerodynamically influences on the motion of small particles in the near vicinity of solid wall surfaces (especially under small angles of attack). In this experiments spherical glass beads were used as particle material. In a second test facility we have investigated the real impact of non-spherical pulverised fuel particles on a steel/ceramic target. In this experiments PF particles were accelerated by an injector using inert gas like e. g. CO 2 or N 2 as the carrier phase in order to avoid dust explosion hazards. The obtained data for the particle-wall collision models were compared to those obtained for glass spheres, where bouncing models are proofed to be valid. Furthermore the second test facility was used to obtain particle erosion rates for PF particles on steel targets as a function of impact angles and velocities. The results of experimental investigations has been incorporated into the numerical model. Hereafter the numerical approach MISTRAL/PartFlow- 3 D has been applied to the PF flow through a ''riffle'' type bifurcator. Using ICEM/CFD-Hexa as grid generator a numerical mesh with approximately 4 million grid cells has been designed for approximation of the complex geometry of the flow splitting device with all its interior fittings and <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes.</b> Based on a predicted gas flow field a large number of PF particles are tracked throughout the flow geometry of the flow-splitter. Besides mean quantities of the particle flow field like e. g. local particle concentrations, mean particle velocities, distribution of mean particle diameter, etc. it is now possible to obtain information about particle erosion on riffle plates and <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes</b> of the flow splitting device. Furthermore the influence of different roping patterns in front of the flow splitter on the uniformness of PF mass flow rate splitting after the bifurcator has been investigated numerically. Results show the efficient operation of the investigated bifurcator in absence of particle roping, this means under conditions of an uniform PF particle concentration distribution in the inflow cross section of the bifurcator. If particle roping occurs and particle concentration differs over the pipe cross section in front of the bifurcator the equal PF particle mass flow rate splitting can be strongly deteriorated in dependence on the location and intensity of the particle rope or particle concentration irregularities. The presented results show the importance of further development of efficient rope splitting devices for applications in coal-fired power plants. Numerical analysis can be used as an efficient tool for their investigation and further optimisation under various operating and flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} proved {{previously}} that the Tornado-like swirling flows have strictly ordered hydrodynamic structure which can be exhaustively described by using the exact solution of non-stationary Navier-Stokes and continuity equations for this class of flows [1]. Analysis of the geometry of the flowing channel of the left ventricle (LV) and aorta has shown close correlation between {{the shape of the}} cavities and intraventricular trabeculae orientation with the streamlines of Tornado-like flows. LV casts morphometry, MRI tomography and 4 D velocimetry of the flow velocity field in the aorta, allowed to prove that the blood flow in the LV and aorta corresponds to this class of flows and may be described using the exact solution [7, 8, 10]. The current study proposes a method of measurement and calculation of the flow structural parameters derived from the exact solution, using LV cavity casts morphometry in humans and dogs and Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) of LV in two patients without severe cardiac pathology. It has been shown that the dynamic expression of intracardiac trabeculae and instant shape of LV cavity within a complete cardiac cycle correspond closely to the stages of single Tornado-like jet evolution. Since the intraventricular trabeculae profile is streamlined continuously by the blood flow, it should determine the hydrodynamic flow structure as an ensemble of <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes.</b> Therefore it has been concluded that the intraventricular flow dynamics can be analyzed and quantified using the exact solution. Application of this analysis to the MSCT visualization of LV cavity dynamics has shown the validity of this approach, which may be used for clinical diagnostic purpose.

40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes. It is assumed that it is the sharp trailing edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> that causes turbulence over the vanes in pump mode, thus making the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> move about within the play of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{investigation}} is related to the heat transfer and fluid flow problem inside ribbed ducts with a square cross section. The typical applications of this problem are in the cooling of gas turbine blades and <b>guiding</b> <b>vanes.</b> The second part is related to application of intercoolers in gas turbine systems. The intercooling is performed via intercoolers that usually are water-air heat exchangers. The ducts considered have rib turbulators in order to enhance the heat transfer rate. Firstly, a literature investigation is carried out and examples of different prediction methods for ribbed ducts are presented. Application of these ribbed ducts in cooling for gas turbine blades are discussed. The importance and role of intercoolers in gas turbine systems are discussed and their importance in future gas turbine systems is mentioned. Importance of various heat exchangers and extended surface types is presented and examples of heat exchangers concepts for intercooler applications are considered. A numerical calculation procedure is presented. The governing equations are the continuity, the Navier-Stokes and the energy equations in their general form for incompressible flows. In turbulent cases the time averaged form of this set of equations has been used. The turbulence modeling consists of two low-Re number turbulence models and two methods for determination of the turbulent Reynolds stresses, namely, Eddy Viscosity Model (EVM) and Explicit Algebraic Stress Model (EASM). The model development is carried out to ensure that the original EASM is consistent with the low-Re number k-epsilon turbulence model applied. A certain method is developed to deal with the de-coupling of the velocity and Reynolds stress fields in the collocated grid arrangement that is chosen in this work. The pressure-velocity coupling is handled by the SIMPLEC algorithm in turbulent cases and the PISO algorithm in unsteady laminar flow cases. Seven papers are included. In the first paper turbulent flow and heat transfer in a rotating smooth duct and a ribbed duct is considered. An EVM method with a low-Re number model is applied. The second paper consists of application of EASM and EVM with a low-Re number model to a ribbed duct case and presentation of detailed local variables and flow phenomena. The third paper presents a discussion of the role of intercoolers in gas turbine systems and means to improve performance are mentioned. The fourth paper presents a set of numerical analyses and CFD calculations carried out on various concepts of intercoolers. The fifth paper presents a discussion and comparison of some heat exchanger types readily applicable for a gas turbine intercooler. A comparison of the intercooler core volume, weight and pressure drop is presented. In the sixth paper two low-Re number turbulence models and EVM and EASM models are used to investigate a ribbed duct case. The local results as well as the averaged total values are compared with available experimental results. In the final paper, unsteady calculations for an offset strip fin have been carried out.

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} study is {{conducted}} toward hybrid flow control of a full scale transport truck side mirror at ReD 3 : 2 105. A slim <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is employed for redirecting high-momentum flow toward the mirror wake region. Leading edge separation from the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is reduced or eliminated {{by means of an}} alternating current-dielectric barrier discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuator. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are performed at a range of velocities from 15 to 25 m/s and from windward to leeward angles from 5 deg to 5 deg. Time-averaged velocity fields are obtained {{at the center of the}} mirror for three scenarios: (a) reference case lacking any control elements, (b) <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> only, and (c) combination of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and the AC-DBD plasma actuator. The comparison of cases demonstrates that at 25 m/s windward conditions ð 5 degÞ the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is capable of recovering 17 % momentum with respect to the reference case. No sig-nificant change is observed by activating the AC-DBD plasma actuator. In contrast, at leeward conditions ð 5 degÞ, the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> results in a 20 % momentum loss that is rec-tified to a 6 % recovery with actuation. The above implies that for a truck with two mir-rors, 23 % of momentum may be recovered. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4030724]...|$|R

Experiments in Fluids 24 (1998) 265 — 272 (Springer-Verlag 1998 Measurement and calculation of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> performance in expanding bends for wind-tunnels B. Lindgren, J. O ® sterlund, A. V. Johansson Abstract The design of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> for use in expanding bends was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The primary application in mind is the use of expanding corners in wind-tunnels for the purpose of constructing compact circuits with low losses. To investigate the perfor-mance of <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> in realistic situations expansion ratios between 1 and 5 3 were tested in the experiments. These were carried out in an open wind-tunnel specially built for the present purpose. The experimental results demonstrated that suitably designed <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> give very low losses and retained flow quality even for quite substantial expansion ratios. For wind-tunnel applications expansion ratios around 1. 3 seem appropriate, Optimization of a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> design was done using a two-dimensional cascade code, Mises.

40|$|The use of elbow or curved pipe in the {{installation}} of piping has a loss of pressure (pressure drop) which could lead the power of pump that drive the fluid and decrease the energy efficiency of the system. The pressure drop {{is caused by the}} curved shape of the elbow that cause pressure on the outer wall (outter) larger and blocking off the pace of the fluid, and flow pressure losses caused by friction, flow separation and secondary flow. A method {{that can be used to}} reduce flow separation and pressure loss in the elbow is by the insertion <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> The test model in the form of rectangular elbow 900   with a radius ratio (rc/Dh) = 1. 1249 without using a <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and number of <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> insertion one until three <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> With Reynolds number ReDh ≈ 8. 6 × 104.

Even though nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage.

The objective of the current work was to study the effect of cooling air temperature on cooling effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Gas pressure, gas temperature, cooling air pressure was kept constant and the cooling air temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to cooling air temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied.

40|$|Clearance {{gaps between}} <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and cover plates of Francis {{turbines}} tend {{to increase in}} size due to simultaneous effect of secondary flow and erosion in sediment affected hydropower plants. The pressure {{difference between the two}} sides of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> induces leakage flow through the gap. This flow enters into the suction side with high acceleration, disturbing the primary flow and causing more erosion and losses in downstream turbine components. A cascade rig containing a single <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> passage has been built to study the effect of the clearance gap using pressure sensors and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technique. This study focuses on developing a numerical model of the test rig, validating the results with experiments and investigating the behavior of leakage flow numerically. It was observed from both CFD and experiment that the leakage flow forms a passage vortex, which shifts away from the wall while travelling downstream. The streamlines contributing to the formation of this vortex have been discussed. Furthermore, the reference <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> with symmetrical hydrofoil has been compared with four cambered profiles, in terms of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> loading and the consequent effect on the leakage flow. A dimensionless term called Leakage Flow Factor (Lff) has been introduced to compare the performances of hydrofoils. It is shown that the leakage flow and its effect on increasing losses and erosion can be minimized by changing the pressure distribution over the <b>guide</b> <b>vane...</b>|$|R
