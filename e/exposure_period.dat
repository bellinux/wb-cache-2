50|$|Both the procollagen {{domain and}} the type I repeats of TSP1 {{have been shown to}} inhibit neovascularization and EC migration. However, it is {{unlikely}} that the mechanisms of action of these fragments are the same. The type I repeats of TSP1 are capable of inhibiting EC migration in a Boyden chamber assay after a 3-4 hour exposure, whereas a 36- to 48-hour <b>exposure</b> <b>period</b> is necessary for inhibition of EC migration with the procollagen domain. Whereas the chorioallantroic membrane (CAM) assay shows the type I repeats of TSP1 to be antiangiogenic, it also shows that the procollagen sequence lacks anti-angiogenic activity. This may be in part because the animo-terminal end of TSP1 differs more than the carboxy-terminal end across species, but may also suggest different mechanisms of action.|$|E

The influence of the temperature during the air <b>exposure</b> <b>periods</b> was studied. Cyclic corrosion tests led to enhanced global corrosion damage compared to continuous immersion tests with residual mechanical properties of corroded samples signifi-cantly lower for cyclic tests. The corrosion morphology depended on the exposure conditions. For cyclic tests with air <b>exposure</b> <b>periods</b> at room temperature (CR tests), the corrosion defects were significantly longer; for a cyclic test with air <b>exposure</b> <b>periods</b> at 20 C (CF tests), the propagation of corrosion defects was not promoted; however, the density of corroded grain boundaries was markedly increased. For CR samples, the corrosion damage observed was mainly explained taking into account electrochemi-cal processes occurring {{at the tip of the}} defect which could be considered as an occluded zone characterized by a chloride-enriched electrolyte and Hþ reduction as major cathodic reaction. For CF tests, the interaction between the stresses induced by the phase transformation of the medium i. e solidification and the hydrogen enrichment of the substrate could be a possible mechanism explaining the evolution of the global mechanical properties of the corroded samples...|$|R
