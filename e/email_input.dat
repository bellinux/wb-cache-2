40|$|Phishing is a {{criminal}} scheme to steal the user‟s personal data and other credential information. It is a fraud that acquires victim‟s confidential information such as password, bank account detail, credit card number, financial username and password etc. and later it can be misuse by attacker. In this research paper, we proposed a new anti-phishing algorithm, which we call ObURL Detection Algorithm. The ObURL Detection Algorithm used to detect the URL Obfuscation Phishing attacks and it provides the multilayer security over the internet fraud. The ObURL Detection Algorithm can detect the hyperlink, content of hyperlink‟s destination URL, iFrame in <b>email,</b> <b>input</b> form, input form in iFrame source URL, iFrame within iFrame, and after all that multiple tests will be perform such as DNS Test, IP address Test, URL Encode Test, Shorten URL Test, Black and Whitelist Test, URL pattern matching Test On that collected data. Our experiments verified that ObURL Detection Algorithm is effective to detect both known and unknown URL Obfuscation phishing attacks...|$|E

Using labeled <b>emails</b> as <b>input</b> dataset, containing phishing emails and non-phishing emails, topic distribution probabilities {{and word}} distribution probabilities are obtained {{by building a}} PLSA model. The similarity score is computed using Fisher Kernel similarity function between test emails and emails in the training set. The label of the training email that yields the highest similarity score is considered the label of the test email.|$|R

ASCII only schemes remain popular in <b>email</b> correspondence and <b>input</b> methods because of their ease of entry. These schemes are also called Manglish. The disadvantage of ASCII schemes is that letter case is meaningful, so that transliterated names may not be capitalized.|$|R

Aardvark is a social search engine {{that is based on}} the [...] "village paradigm" [...] which is about connecting the user who has a question with friends or friends of friends whom can answer his or her question. In Aadvark, a user ask a question in different ways that mostly involves online ways such as instant messaging, <b>email,</b> web <b>input</b> or other non-online ways such as text message or voice. The Aardvark algorithm forwards the question to someone in the asker extended social network who has the highest probability in knowing the answer to the question. Aadvark was obtained by Google in 2010 and Abandoned later in 2011.|$|R

The company was founded by AJ Nelson and Joe Dallago, former University of Iowa students who developed the website. The company was founded in 2012 and the website officially launched in 2013 with $100,000 from local Iowan investors, focusing only on the University of Iowa {{in the form of}} a 2011-2012 beta test that resulted in about 750 users by the end of 2012. After launch the site reached ten thousand users. In January 2014 the company expanded to an additional fifteen further universities. Nelson is the company’s CEO and Dallago is the company’s CTO.|$|R
40|$|We present Aardvark, {{a social}} search engine. With Aardvark, users ask a {{question}}, either by instant message, <b>email,</b> web <b>input,</b> text message, or voice. Aardvark then routes {{the question to}} {{the person in the}} user’s extended social network most {{likely to be able to}} answer that question. As compared to a traditional web search engine, where the challenge lies in finding the right document to satisfy a user’s information need, the challenge in a social search engine like Aardvark lies in finding the right person to satisfy a user’s information need. Further, while trust in a traditional search engine is based on authority, in a social search engine like Aardvark, trust is based on intimacy. We describe how these considerations inform the architecture, algorithms, and user interface of Aardvark, and how they are reflected in the behavior of Aardvark users...|$|R

Text input {{in mobile}} devices is {{becoming}} {{even more important}} with the increasing amount of text-based services such as mobile <b>email.</b> The keypad <b>input</b> of small mobile devices could benefit from well designed auditory feedback. In this paper three different key feedback sound schemes are studied in multitap input of a standard telephone keypad [1]. In this paper {{is the effect of}} three different feedback schemes to the efficiency of text input were studied. Also the user preferences during a two-week usage period were observed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Email</b> address Abstract. <b>Inputs</b> to web forms often contain typos {{or other}} errors. However, {{existing}} web form design tools require end-user developers to write regular expressions (“regexps”) or even scripts to validate inputs, which {{is slow and}} errorprone because of the poor match between common data types and the regexp notation. We present a new technique enabling end-user developers to describe data {{as a series of}} constrained parts, and we have incorporated our technique into a prototype tool. Using this tool, end-user developers can create validation code more quickly and accurately than with existing techniques, finding 90 % of invalid inputs in a lab study. This study and our evaluation of the technique’s generality have motivated several tool improvements, which we have implemented and now evaluate using the Cognitive Dimensions framework...|$|R
40|$|Statistical spam {{filters are}} known to be {{vulnerable}} to adversarial attacks. One of the more common adversarial attacks, known as the good word attack, thwarts spam filters by appending to spam messages sets of “good ” words, which are words that are common in legitimate email but rare in spam. We present a counterattack strategy that attempts to differentiate spam from legitimate <b>email</b> in the <b>input</b> space by transforming each email into a bag of multiple segments, and subsequently applying multiple instance logistic regression on the bags. We treat each segment in the bag as an instance. An email is classified as spam if at least one instance in the corresponding bag is spam, and as legitimate if all the instances in it are legitimate. We show that a classifier using our multiple instance counterattack strategy is more robust to good word attacks than its single instance counterpart and other single instance learners commonly used in the spam filtering domain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Privacy {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{societal}} concerns raised by critics of the uncontrolled growth and spread of information technology in developed societies. The purpose of this paper is to propose a privacy compliance engine that takes <b>email</b> messages as <b>input</b> and filters those that violate the privacy rules of the organization in which it is deployed. Our system includes two main parts: an information extraction module that extracts the names of the sender and recipients as well as sensitive information contained in the message; and an inference engine that matches the email information against a knowledge base owned by the organization. This engine then applies compliance rules to the information obtained from the extraction and database matching steps of the process. This prototype is currently being developed for a university setting. In this setting, it was shown to obtain a precision score of 77 %. The next step of our research will be to adapt our system to the context of a health organization, where privacy rules are more complex and more sensitive. ...|$|R
