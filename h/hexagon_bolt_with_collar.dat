Unison is a company engaged in the production of <b>bolts,</b> <b>with</b> a product metric <b>hexagon</b> <b>bolts,</b> UNC withworth, and steel hexagon with all sorts of sizes. These bolts are made from raw materials purchased wire rod from PT. Krakatau Steel and PT. Ispat Indo, wire rod materials are also imported directly from China and Taiwan. At present the quality of the products in PT. Unison is not maximized, this is indicated by the large number of product defect is large enough.

40|$|Baffle Former Bolts {{are vital}} joint {{elements}} of the reactor core internal structure. Since 1989, successive UT inspections in various European plants have revealed a trend of progressive indications. Different bolt and locking designs have been used during the initial design and building phase of the plants. Lock-bar style bolts are one type of bolts which are used in numerous plants in Europe and the US. Lock-bar style bolts pose a challenge due to limited ultrasonic probe access availability. Furthermore, the inspection approach has to capture indications in the bolt threaded region {{as well as in}} the bolt head to shank interface. During recently performed qualifications in Europe the ultrasonic inspection of lock-bar style bolts has been improved by using advanced probe design and an an alysis approach. Based on blind test qualification testing performed on sample bolts a high degree of confidence could be achieved. Inner <b>hexagon</b> (hex) <b>bolts</b> <b>with</b> a locking washer represent another design used in several plants in Europe and the US. This bolt design poses another challenge based on varying cone dimensions and limited access through the inner hex. Ultrasonic beam field simulations have been performed to support and verify laboratory and qualification testing. This paper describes the qualification process in more detail. Furthermore, field experiences will be presented. These inspections were performed employing a variety of delivery platforms including robotic manipulators and submarines. This will provide a basis for the comparison of the respective benefits of these d ifferent approaches...|$|R

40|$|Recently, by the {{development}} of computer technology, the system of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is being utilized and is being popularized in many enterprises, and it is a necessary for design or drafting in many industrial fields such as machine design. Under these back ground, 4 engineering work stations for CAD/CAM was introduced at Tsuyama National College of Technology in 1990. Therefore, {{the development}} and investigation on many educational system or soft ware of CAD/CAM that enable to utilize for machine design and drafting, engineering experimentation, engineering work and so on will be necessary. This investigation was performed as a objection to draw up a model for <b>hexagon</b> head <b>bolt</b> and to practice the parametric component graphic analysis (PCM), Results obtained are follows; 1) A program for PCM was developed and practiced. 2) A model of <b>hexagon</b> head <b>bolt</b> was drawn up...|$|R
