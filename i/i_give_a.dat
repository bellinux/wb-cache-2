500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan {{was largely}} positive. McNutt called Novak's acting [...] "some of [...] best {{work in a}} long time". He called the plots conclusion [...] "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well". White wrote that [...] "If it weren't for [...] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely." [...] Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending {{due to the fact}} that it concluded with [...] "boos and hisses". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that [...] "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more like someone you bring in for a multi-episode arc." [...] Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote [...] "the Ryan-Kelly stuff <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> 10/10." ...|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> lot of credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Q {{magazine}} awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows. He commented [...] "Since when has lip-synching been live? Anyone who lip-synchs {{in public}} on stage when you pay $134 {{to see them}} should be shot. That's me off her fucking Christmas card list. [...] But do <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> toss? No." [...] Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, rejected John's allegations by saying [...] "Madonna does not lip-sync nor does she spend her time trashing other artists, [...] She sang every note of her Re-Invention tour live and is not ashamed that she was well paid for her hard work. [...] Elton John remains on her Christmas card list whether he is nice...or naughty." [...] John later released a statement to Entertainment Weekly saying {{that he would like}} to apologize to Madonna for his comments. He said: ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine {{disapproved of}} [...] "Jump", writing {{that it is}} an [...] "ice-cold" [...] and [...] "echoey dubstep torture chamber" [...] whereby Rihanna interpolates Ginuwine's [...] "Pony" [...] sample void of emotion. Rihanna's vocals on the song sound similar to the vocals by Justin Timberlake on his 2002 single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] (Justified, 2002). Lyrically, in [...] "Jump" [...] Rihanna preaches to her former partner that she won't be chasing him. Jude Rodgers of The Guardian {{described}} it as a [...] "see sex wriggling everywhere". In the song, the singer sings [...] "Skrillex-worthy" [...] lines, [...] "You think <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> damn/ but you know who I am/ I don't go around chasing no dude". The chorus features Rihanna singing, [...] "If you want it, let's do it/ Ridin' my pony/ My saddle is waitin'/ Come and jump on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her autobiography, A Lonely Life, Davis gave a {{different}} version {{about having to}} see Bankhead in the play. [...] "A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way {{to be influenced by}} her work. It was Willie's intention that <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> different interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way." [...] "I had to do that part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous." [...] Charles Dingle, Carl Benton Reid, Dan Duryea, and Patricia Collinge all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised.|$|E
