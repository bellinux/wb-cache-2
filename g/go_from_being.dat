25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E
500|$|The city {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record dating back in 1336 by its Greek name, Αργυρόκαστρο - Argyrokastro, {{as part of the}} Byzantine Empire. It became part of the Orthodox Christian doecese of Dryinoupolis and Argyrokastro after the destruction of nearby Adrianoupolis. Gjirokastër later became the center of the principality ruled by John Zenevisi (1373–1417) before falling under Ottoman rule for the next five centuries. Throughout the Ottoman era Gjirokastër was officially known in Ottoman Turkish as Ergiri and also Ergiri Kasrı. During the Ottoman period conversions to Islam and an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside made Gjirokastër <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> an overwhelmingly [...] Christian city in the 16th century into one with a large Muslim population by the early 19th century. Gjirokastër also became a major religious centre for Bektashi Sufism. Taken by the Hellenic Army during the Balkan Wars of 1912–3 on account of its large Greek population, it was eventually incorporated into the newly independent state of Albania in 1913. This proved highly unpopular with the local Greek population, who rebelled; after several months of guerrilla warfare, the short-lived Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was established in 1914 with Gjirokastër as its capital. It was definitively awarded to Albania in 1921. In more recent years, the city witnessed anti-government protests that lead to the Albanian civil war of 1997.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E

Max is eventually arrested for cutting the brakes on Blume's car.|$|E
2500|$|I {{wanted to}} explore the anatomy of {{depression}} — how it works and why it happens to people; how you can <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> down but able to handle it, to being so down that you don’t even want to handle it, and then taking a radical step with your life — trying to commit suicide — and failing at that, {{coming back to the}} world and having to [...] "act normal" [...] when, in fact, you have been forever changed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{additions}} of Mike Minor as Steve Elliott and Meredith MacRae as {{the third}} Billie Jo influenced this change, as they were both accomplished singers. The characters of Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo also changed. Billie Jo <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a boy-crazy dumb blonde to a strong, independent young lady. Bobbie Jo <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> book-smart (nicknamed [...] "the walking encyclopedia") to more of a bubble-head used for comic relief.|$|R

2500|$|The Aussie is intelligent, learns quickly, {{and loves}} to play. This {{means that a}} bored, neglected, unexercised Aussie may invent its own games, activities, and jobs, which to a busy owner might appear to be hyperactivity: for example, an Aussie may <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> at rest to running at top speed for several [...] "laps" [...] around the house before {{returning}} to rest. Without something to amuse them, Aussies can become destructive. Aussies also do best with plenty of human companionship: they are often called [...] "Velcro dogs" [...] for their strong desire to always be near their owners and for their tendency to form intense, devoted bonds with select people.|$|E
2500|$|Voris {{cites the}} death of his brother from a heart attack in 2003, {{followed}} by his mother dying from stomach cancer in 2004 as the events that moved him to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> [...] "a lukewarm Catholic, someone who usually just went through the motions at church" [...] to an [...] "aggressive global advocate for conservative Catholics... on a burning mission to save Catholicism and America by trying to warn the public about what he sees as a decline of morality in society."

2500|$|In Queer Girls and Popular Culture, Susan Driver {{states that}} {{television}} ascribes to viewers what lesbians look and act like, and that realistic portrayals of girls outside {{the norm of}} white, upper or middle class, and heterosexual are extremely rare. Realistic depictions of lesbians are so rare that they become strong role models and enable [...] "hope and imagination" [...] for girls limited by the conditions of their immediate surroundings, who may know of no other gay people. The time and space given to Willow to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a shy scared girl into a confident woman {{who falls in love}} with another woman is, as of 2007, unique in television; it does not occur in one flash or single moment. It is a progression that defies strict definition. Manda Scott in The Herald states that Willow's lack of panic or self-doubt when she realizes she is in love with Tara makes her [...] "the best role model a teen could ask for".|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} Jason D. Taylor {{called the}} album [...] "a cathartic, chaotic release". As it continues, [...] "the listener will <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> stunned to outright jaw-dropping incredulity." [...] He {{said that the}} record was very comparable to Drowningman in the regard that both bands are able to [...] "flawlessly twist your mind into a pretzel and then straighten it back out with the occasional melody." [...] Taylor concluded his review {{by saying that the}} [...] "reluctance to remove the album from your stereo is surely proof enough {{that this is one of}} the most potentially amazing bands inhabiting the metalcore scene". Mustapha Mond of Lambgoat said the album was [...] " [...] it's as peppy as tough, crazy hardcore can get. And on top of the boots-rocking beat, ETID layers breakdown after breakdown". He said it [...] "keeps up the rocking for ten powerful tracks, and manages to put enough artistry into them that any one, listened to alone, will knock your socks off". In a review for Punknews.org, Brian Shultz said the album brought [...] "the terms [...] "rhetoric" [...] and [...] "caustic" [...] each to a whole new level." [...] He noted that the band [...] "stray from choruses like they were acting out magnetism laws" [...] and praised Buckley's [...] "penetrating screams and joyously wild yells". He mentioned that the guitars [...] "flip-flop between frenetic riffing and hyperactive decrescendos. ... it's metalcore that does not let the fuck up." ...|$|E
