After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued, and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians {{did not appear to}} possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian on Earth would have them. In this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council scoffed at Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son.|$|E
25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. <b>If</b> <b>nobody</b> comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E

5000|$|The series {{takes on}} a {{different}} format to Garrett’s normal slate of videos: “It’s different to my normal videos just playing and talking about Minecraft. It’s a completely scripted show, and the production values are much higher: there’s an original score and lots of sound effects and overlays.”. Additionally, the series is pitched as an educational show for children, however Garrett stressed that entertainment is the main priority: [...] "There’s no point having an educational show <b>if</b> <b>nobody’s</b> going to watch it".|$|R
500|$|At first, Singh kept a low profile; in 1911 she was {{reluctant}} to make speeches in public or at Women's Social and Political Union meetings. She refused to chair meetings, telling her WSPU colleagues she was [...] "quite useless {{for that sort of}} thing" [...] and would only say [...] "five words <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else would support the forthcoming resolution". However, Singh later chaired and addressed a number of meetings. Hirabai, an Indian student in England, noted in 1911 that she displayed a small yellow-and-green badge with her motto: [...] "Votes for women".|$|E
500|$|Robey {{made his}} {{television}} debut in August 1938 but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. [...] The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his [...] "comic quality" [...] was conveyed {{on the small}} screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should [...] "be forbidden, by his own angel, <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were [...] "really too slow for television".|$|E
500|$|The beat boom {{flourished in}} Uruguay during the mid-1960s {{in a period}} {{sometimes}} referred to as the Uruguayan Invasion. [...] Two of the best known acts were Los Shakers and Los Mockers. In Peru, los Saicos were one of the first bands to gain national prominence. [...] Their 1965 song [...] "¡Demolición!" [...] with its humorously anarchistic lyrics was a huge hit in Peru. [...] AllMusic, writing about Los Saicos, noted [...] "These guys were a punk rock band, even <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> outside Lima knew it at the time". [...] Los Yorks became one of Peru's leading groups. Colombia had bands such Los Speakers from Bogata. [...] Los Gatos Salvajes, who came from Rosario, Argentina, were one of the country's first beat groups, and two of their members went on to form Los Gatos, who became a popular act in Argentina during the late 1960s.|$|E

500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|Hood and Fox were {{in dispute}} on the film's direction. One of the {{disputes}} involved {{the depiction of}} Wolverine as an Army veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes. The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions. Hood remarked, [...] "Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better. [...] I hope the film's better because of the debates. <b>If</b> <b>nobody</b> were talking about us, we'd be in trouble!" [...] Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both [...] "forceful" [...] personalities in creative meetings but they {{had never had a}} [...] "stand-up" [...] argument. In January 2009, after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts, such as Hugh Jackman's publicity commitments for Australia, production moved to Vancouver, mostly at Kitsilano Secondary School and in University of British Columbia. Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography.|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} crew of JAT Flight 367, {{flying from}} Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark {{on the morning}} of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367 and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović says she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. [...] "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," [...] she recalled. [...] "So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn't want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else had a son or daughter." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [...] "planned for years", but she spent two months going over her plan before she began writing seriously. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it better than I liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to escape attempts, prisoners {{also tried to}} make the life of their guards more miserable by resorting to [...] "goon-baiting", making nuisances of themselves by harassing the guards. For example, they would drop water bombs on the guards. Douglas Bader encouraged his junior officers to do the same. British Flight Lieutenant Pete Tunstall especially tried to cause havoc by disturbing the roll call even <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> was trying to escape, so that the guards would not become suspicious when somebody was. He went through a total of five courts-martial and suffered a total of 415 days in solitary confinement.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the loss}} of {{swerving}} is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs <b>if</b> <b>nobody</b> swerves, the reasonable strategy {{would seem to be}} to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that he will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying {{there is more than one}} Nash equilibrium, which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing his own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the pure strategy equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.) ...|$|E
