50|$|The McNab Dog is bred for its working {{ability and}} is not {{recognized}} by the American Kennel Club (AKC). For this reason, {{the appearance of the}} McNab can vary considerably. The dog is medium sized with females standing 16-21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30-50 pounds and males standing 18-25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35-65 pounds. The dogs have a variety of <b>ear</b> sets <b>from</b> pricked <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> floppy <b>ears</b> and everything in between. Most McNabs are black or brown with white feet, white collars, white facial strips and white tipped tails, but tricolor McNabs are well known as well as mostly black McNabs. Some McNabs sport random white patches on their bodies and faces. Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored with occasional marble flecked or powder blue eyes. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their cat-like feet which contribute to their agility. Another distinctive trait of the McNab is that it lacks dew claws on the rear feet, as opposed to the Border Collie where this is a common occurrence (per Gary Williams).|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) {{laser scanning}} technology has {{found to be}} an excellent method for modeling and measuring 3 D objects. The 3 D point clouds of an object can be acquired within less than one second and stored digitally for pre-processing task. Complex mapping of 3 D object such as human faces required at least two scanning images to cover the complete facial area (<b>from</b> right <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> left <b>ear,</b> and <b>from</b> hair line <b>to</b> bottom part of the chin) with optimum 3 D modeling accuracy. For complete 3 D model generation, the scanning images are needed to be registered and merged together. Existing registration method used corresponding features between the two scanned images as registration primitive and finally 3 D transformation algorithm was applied to register the images. This paper describes the use of photogrammetric targets, as registration primitive to register two scanning images of human face. The so called “paper targets” were setup on the special design photogrammetric control frame where the human face was placed at {{the middle of the}} frame during scanning process. The photogrammetric control frame was calibrated using close-range convergent photogrammetry with coded targets and high precision scale bars to determine the precise 3 D coordinate of such targets. The targets were also included in the scanning images and represented as point clouds. Via laser scanning images, the centroid of the targets was precisely measured and the 3 D transformation algorithm was successfully applied to transform the scanning point clouds from laser scanning coordinate system to photogrammetric coordinate system. The output of the registered point clouds was displayed and processed in reverse engineering RapidForm 2004 software. The accuracy of the method was evaluated using shell-shell deviation analysis method where the average deviation of the two scanning images was calculated. The results show that the accuracy of the 3 D registration accuracy using photogrammetric targets was measured to be 0. 129 mm to 0. 285 mm. The reliability of the 3 D registration accuracy using photogrammetric targets method was also evaluated and the standard deviation of the method is 0. 10 mm to 0. 50 m...|$|R

25|$|The exact {{shape of}} the Irish tonsure is unclear from the early sources, {{although}} they agree that the hair was in some way shorn over the head <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>ear.</b> In 1639 James Ussher suggested a semi-circular shape, rounded {{in the front and}} culminating at a line between the ears. This suggestion was accepted by many subsequent writers, but in 1703, Jean Mabillon put forth a new hypothesis, claiming that the entire forehead was shaven back to the ears. Mabillon's version was widely accepted, but contradicts the early sources. In 2003 Daniel McCarthy suggested a triangular shape, with one side between the ears and a vertex towards the front of the head. The Collectio canonum Hibernensis cites the authority of Saint Patrick as indicating that the custom originated with the swineherd of Lóegaire mac Néill, the king who opposed Patrick.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>ear</b> under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>ear.</b> A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E
500|$|The {{required}} {{direction of}} current depended on {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> <b>ear,</b> causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E

2500|$|The LDS temple rituals {{formerly}} {{provided an}} example in which capital punishment is contemplated for violation of historical blood oaths in the Endowment ritual.
