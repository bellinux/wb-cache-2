50|$|According to the {{findings}} of the investigations set by the European Union, Argentine and Indonesian companies benefit from an unfair advantage because of the access they have to raw materials at prices that are low compared to the world market prices available to the EU producers of biodiesel. This is because of the high export taxes that the Argentine and Indonesian government imposes on raw materials used in the biodiesel production. The investigation found that the dumping margin of Argentina was around 41.9% and 49.2%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 23.3%. However, by applying the EU “Lesser duty rule”, the anti-dumping duties will be imposed {{at the level of the}} <b>injury</b> <b>margin,</b> for most exporting producers, which is for Argentina between 22% and 25.7%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 20.5%. In other Words, the duties were fixed not to constitute a punishment, but to prevent further injury to the EU industry.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how European anti-dumping policy under {{imperfect competition}} affects firm behaviour and domestic welfare. Our theoretical {{model is the}} first to complement the European empirical literature on anti-dumping policy (see Messerlin (1989), Hindley (1988), Tharakan and Waelbroeck (1994)), and can usefully be compared with recent papers dealing with the effects of US anti-dumping policy (Reitzes (1993), Fischer (1992), Prusa (1994)). We use a two-period Cournot duopoly model with a European and a foreign firm that differ in costs and products. European anti-dumping policy differs from its US counterpart mainly in terms of <b>injury</b> <b>margin</b> calculation and the derivation of the anti-dumping duty. European anti-dumping rules provide the home firm with incentives to either induce or to feign injury. Our results indicate that when the level of protection is endogenous, the strategic trade policy argument for protection need not apply. Our findings also suggest that US anti-dumping rules perform better than European rules in terms of welfare and in terms of protecting domestic value added and employment.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{finds that the}} average level of European {{antidumping}} protection against Central Europe in 1985 - 1990 was by 14 to 20 percentage points too high. Her simulation results on the Central European antidumping cases show only 'de minimis' <b>injury</b> <b>margins.</b> Hence, the European Commission would have dismissed all European antidumping complaints against Central European imports and no antidumping measures would have been imposed. In view of these results, the author feels that European antidumping legislation and its implementation seriously undermine {{the credibility of the}} Association Agreements recently signed between the European Union and the countries of Central Europe. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the GATT/WTO rules for anti-dumping measures in a duopoly model with both {{horizontal and vertical}} product differentiation. The GATT/WTO rules allow for anti-dumping measures if the domestic producers are injured associated with price discrimination. However, it is argued in this paper that the calculations of <b>injury</b> <b>margins</b> are flawed because of negligence of quality differences. This gives countries with high quality producers an option to practice protectionism. This bias in the possibility to implement anti-dumping measures predominantly favours the developed countries which are specialized in producing high quality products. The paper also shows that qualities and prices converge when trade costs decrease. Moreover, it is shown that a decrease of trade costs harms the profit of the high quality producer and this might increase the high quality producer’s pressure for anti-dumping measures. The paper suggests that prices should be corrected for quality differences {{in the assessment of}} injury. Such change will limit the number of anti-dumping cases, but also eliminate the advantage of the developed countries in the ability to introduce anti-dumping measures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundOver recent years, {{use of the}} LigaSure™ vessel {{sealing device}} has {{increased}} in major abdominal surgery to include pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). LigaSure™ use during PD has expanded to include all steps of the procedure, including {{the division of the}} uncinate margin. This introduces the potential for thermal major vascular <b>injury</b> or <b>margin</b> positivity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LigaSure™ usage in PD in comparison to established dissection techniques. MethodsOne hundred and forty‐eight patients who underwent PD from 2007 to 2012 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital were identified from a retrospective database. Two groups were recognized: those in which the LigaSure™ device was used (N = 114), and in those it was not (N = 34). Peri‐operative outcomes were compared. ResultsVascular intra‐operative complications directly caused by thermal injury from LigaSure™ use occurred in 1. 8 % of patients. Overall vascular intra‐operative complications, uncinate margin positivity, blood loss, length of stay, and complication severity were not significantly different between groups. The mean operative time was 77 [*]min less (P < 0. 010) in the LigaSure™ group. Savings per case where the LigaSure™ was used amounted to $ 1776. 73. ConclusionLigaSure™ usage during PD is safe and effective. It is associated with decreased operative times, which may decrease operative costs in PD...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{cancer is}} a public health problem with high {{prevalence}} in the population. Local tumor control is best achieved by complete surgical resection with adequate margins. A disease-free surgical margin correlates with a lower rate of local recurrence and {{a higher rate of}} disease-free survival. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can aid in real-time cancer detection. The technique, which evaluates the biochemical composition and structure of tissue fluorescence, is relatively simple, fast and, accurate. Objectives: This study aimed to compare oral squamous cell carcinoma lesions to surgical margins and the mucosa of healthy volunteers by fluorescence spectroscopy. Materials and methods: The sample consisted of 56 individuals, 28 with oral squamous cell carcinoma and 28 healthy volunteers with normal oral mucosa. Thirty six cases (64. 3 %) were male and the mean age was 60. 9 years old. The spectra were classified and compared to histopathology to determine fluorescence efficiency for diagnostic discrimination of tumors. Results: In the analysis of the other cases we observed discrimination between normal mucosa, <b>injury</b> and <b>margins.</b> At two-year follow up, three individuals had local recurrence, and in two cases investigation fluorescence in the corresponding area showed qualitative differences in spectra between the recurrence area and the area without recurrence at the same anatomical site in the same patient. Conclusion: In situ analysis of oral mucosa showed the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool that can aid in discrimination of altered mucosa and normal mucosa.
