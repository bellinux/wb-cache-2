5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{external}} field, {{the director}} of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled it up to the top.

5|$|Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of {{the head}} can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along {{the path of a}} projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E

He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable {{for inclusion in the}} government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.|$|E

Transcription is repressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme, and a genetic screen identified Tup 1 p and Hda 1 p as being required for transcriptional repression. In contrast to FET 3 and CTR 1, Aft 1 p target genes ARN 1 and FIT 1 are transcribed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme. A 14 bp sequence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ARN 1 promoter is necessary and sufficient to permit transcription <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme. Transcription <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme required <b>the</b> presence of Cti 6 p to overcome the effect of Tup 1 p, and Cti 6 p was recruited to the ARN 1 promoter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> heme.

Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been compared with that of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of consumer spending.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones {{is that such}} officers could be directly commissioned as well as promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own ranks. In the Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families. Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' social role was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of administrative tasks, which was necessary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above).
