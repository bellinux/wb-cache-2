500|$|All {{the things}} that {{happened}} were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> the music that much better, because you have passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E

You know, the hard work and dedication that she puts into her shows. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> {{you want to work}} harder at your own craft. She's like a machine." ...|$|E
5000|$|At Peñate's concerts, it is {{customary}} {{that audience}} members enter the stage while the song [...] "Torn On The Platform" [...] is performed. One such stage invasion at the Oxford Zodiac on 22 April 2007 {{resulted in a}} fan stealing Peñate's distortion pedal. After he'd realised it was missing he proclaimed, [...] "D’you know what?

On his {{try to explain}} them how the water heater works, he breaks it and his efforts to fix <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> things worse. Seeing {{that he can not}} fix it, he asks the girls to go to the store to buy him something, so he can stay alone and call his dad (Fred Willard) to tell him what to do.|$|R

500|$|... "On the skewed sets I {{force the}} {{perspective}} either vertically or horizontally," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't {{put your finger}} on it, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you feel like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The fact that I saw it in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Selänne's primary {{attribute}} is his skating speed. Nicknamed the [...] "Finnish Flash", {{he uses his}} speed to evade opposition defenders. [...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E

[...] "Only I thought ye might--as ye {{understand}} these folks' ways--ye {{might be able}} to get at them easy, and mebbe make some copy outer the blamed thing. <b>It</b> would <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a stir here, and be a big boom for the 'Clarion.'" ...|$|R

500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me so happy to see him and I think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke had {{previously}} {{written for the}} WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> so much sense to drive {{in and out of}} these stories." [...] Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.|$|E
500|$|... "I don't like {{violence}}. I never condone hitting anyone, and I {{never thought}} that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [...] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that <b>it</b> would <b>just</b> <b>make</b> things worse." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rob Bricken of Kotaku {{identified}} Khurgorbaeyag {{as one of}} [...] "The 13 Strangest Deities In Dungeons & Dragons", commenting: [...] "The Goblin god of slavery, {{oppression and}} morale, the last of which seems completely incompatible with the first two. It's like being the god of fire, heat, and popsicles — <b>it</b> <b>just</b> doesn't <b>make</b> sense." ...|$|R

500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," [...] and that Grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paltrow filmed small {{roles for}} the 2006 films Love and Other Disasters, Running With Scissors and Infamous, where she sang Cole Porter's [...] "What Is This Thing Called Love?". Her brother Jake Paltrow {{directed}} {{her in his}} feature debut, the romantic comedy The Good Night (2007), in which she starred opposite Penélope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as {{the wife of a}} former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics. View London felt the actress was [...] "clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you wish she'd go back to playing lead roles again".|$|E
5000|$|Earlier in 1985, Divinyls had {{garnered}} {{great success}} with the single [...] "Pleasure and Pain", which went to the top twenty in Australia and also charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.

5000|$|Jack White of The White Stripes related {{his first}} {{reaction}} to the album in a New York Times article: [...] "I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. When I was told {{the history of the}} band and what year they recorded this music, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn’t <b>make</b> sense. Ahead of punk, and ahead of their time.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In part, {{the tension}} {{resulted}} from the historical coincidence of the first viable African American presidential candidate and the first viable woman candidate, running {{against each other in}} the same nomination race. One South Carolina pastor lamented that he had been waiting all his life for either [...] "first" [...] to happen and said, [...] "I really hate that they had to run {{at the same time in}} the same election. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> what should be a wonderful situation very stressful for folk like me. I never imagined you could have too much of a good thing." [...] After the Clinton-Obama tension on this matter, one Democrat said, [...] "After Iowa, Obama was the post-racial candidate who appealed to all of our better natures. Now he's a black politician, and she's a woman. And it is back to politics as usual." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{bringing}} Supernatural to television, creator Eric Kripke {{had been}} developing the series for nearly ten years, having been fascinated with urban legends {{since he was}} a child. He had originally envisioned Supernatural as a movie. He later developed it as a TV series and spent a few years pitching it before it was picked up by The WB. The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van [...] "fighting the demons in search of the truth". Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American...

2500|$|... "Beg" [...] is a midtempo pop {{song with}} a percussion-driven chorus, about a {{relationship}} growing distant. [...] "Died and Gone to Heaven" [...] {{is an old}} school R song of love and passion, which features big harmonies and falsetto vocals. [...] "Gold" [...] is an uptempo soul song. Sebastian inserted a horn line into it from [...] "Shake", a live recording of an Otis Redding track. He said, [...] "You hear an old soul track, old Motown or Memphis, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> you get on your feet." [...] "Battle Scars", a collaboration with Lupe Fiasco, is an R ballad with a hip hop rap about the scars left from hurtful and broken relationships. Sebastian said that usually when he writes a song he comes up with the melody first with no words, but this time some of the lyrics came at the same time. After finishing the song with David Ryan Harris it was recorded leaving the parts where Sebastian envisaged the rap should go. When Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest, Sebastian recorded his rap at his Sydney studio.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "there's {{nothing wrong}} with the point of this picture. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> doesn't <b>make</b> <b>it</b> well"; TV Guide found it [...] "a lucid look behind the {{headlines}} at the people who get out the news" [...] while the Radio Times found it [...] "cosily dated, but an interesting sign of its times." ...|$|R

So the object is not to stop or arrive anywhere; <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> this thing as beautiful as they can.|$|R
2500|$|Overall, Jakala said [...] "the {{series has}} grown on [...] over time. Part {{of the reason}} is that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry {{political}} systems in the abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book." [...] Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as [...] "handsome, suave, and poised" [...] (Jakala), [...] "decisive, smart, and charismatic" [...] (McElhatton), [...] "Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> him all the more likable" [...] (McElhatton). In Jakala's opinion, [...] "One of the strongest things about this series is Sakuragi's character" [...] because [...] "Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect". In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of [...] "a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly understands that the horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It just makes me happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> me happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responses to Gamergate have {{encouraged}} {{the video game}} industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a [...] "Diversity in Technology" [...] program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at {{increasing the number of}} women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that [...] "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling Fortune [...] "f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, ... I think <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> us think twice at times". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the Seattle Times, IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, [...] "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, [...] "We need to stop this. This has got to change." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} classes of {{machines}} for which implicit style design is appropriate, and give guidelines for safe simulation and synthesis of implicit style Verilog that ensure {{the results of}} cycle based simulation agree {{with the results of}} synthesis. Introduction Hardware systems of any complexity inevitably contain one or more state machines. Traditionally, such machines have been designed using the explicit style, where the designer focuses on implementing the transition from the present state to the next state. Although the definition of a state machine eventually involves such transitions, the designer's goal in specifying a state machine is seldom that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> transitions. Rather, the designer wishes the machine to carry out various steps of some algorithm during a sequence of clock cycles. The real work of the designer (choosing an algorithm and deciding how its steps will be scheduled) occurs at a higher level of abstraction than can be expressed clearly in the explicit st [...] ...|$|R
