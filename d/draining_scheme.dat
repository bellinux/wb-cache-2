50|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, {{large areas of}} fenland in East Anglia were {{reclaimed}} via extensive <b>draining</b> <b>schemes.</b> Despite this, crops and livestock were frequently swept away by widescale flooding as the land sank because of the drainage. As a partial solution, windpumps were used to pump water away from flood-affected areas, but relied on the weather and lacked the power required to lift large quantities of water. Wicken Fen nature reserve has a preserved and restored windpump {{which is used to}} manage the water table in the Fen. The advent of steam power in the late 18th century offered a new solution, and these new engines began to spring up around The Fens.|$|R
40|$|The {{leakage current}} in a CMOS image sensor (CIS) can have various origins. Leakage current {{investigations}} {{have focused on}} such things as cobalt-salicide, source and <b>drain</b> <b>scheme,</b> and shallow trench isolation (STI) profile. However, {{there have been few}} papers examining the effects on leakage current of nitride stringers that are formed by gate sidewall etching. So this study reports the results of a series of experiments on the effects of a nitride stringer on real display images. Different step heights were fabricated during a STI chemical mechanical polishing process to form different nitride stringer sizes, arsenic and boron were implanted in each fabricated photodiode, and the doping density profiles were analyzed. Electrons that moved onto the silicon surface caused the dark leakage current, which in turn brought up the speckle defect on the display image in the CIS.

40|$|Many {{different}} factors, such as topology, routing technique, selection function, {{flow control}} policy, complexity of router design, {{contribute to the}} performance of networks on chip (NoCs). Among these factors, the choice of topology and routing function has a significant effect on the average packet latency and saturation behavior. Torus is popular in many application domains, while the problem of virtual channel misbalance caused by its deadlock avoidance scheme brings lots of performance pathologies. In this paper, we present a novel deadlock avoidance scheme based on <b>draining</b> <b>scheme,</b> and propose a deadlock-free routing scheme for torus networks. We quantify the effects of the proposed routing scheme on the overall network performance by presenting simulation results for 1 -D torus and 2 -D torus NoCs. Experimental results show that the novel routing algorithm for torus networks could make more efficient use of virtual channel resources, and hence cutting down packet latency and boosting throughput. Note although this paper has considered 1 -D and 2 -D torus networks in the experimental evaluation, the new scheme is flexible enough to support high-radix torus networks...|$|E

25|$|Holderness Drain {{has three}} pumping {{stations}} along its length, which manage changes in level. The first is at Tickton, {{which was built}} in 1972 {{as part of the}} Holderness <b>Drain</b> <b>scheme.</b> The second is the Great Culvert pumping station, which was built at the same time. This is located close to the point of the original Great Culvert, which carried the high level drain to the River Hull over the low level drain to the Humber. Water from Monkdike and the Foredyke Stream was diverted into the low level drain, with the pumping station raising water from the remainder of the low level drain to the north. The rest of the Foredyke Stream, which carried the high level waters through the city to the River Hull at Stoneferry was abandoned. The East Hull pumping station, near the outlet of the Holderness Drain, has a capacity of , and is jointly managed by Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency. It was originally constructed in 1949, so that the outflow from the drain could be pumped into the Humber when the level of the tides prevented gravity discharge. A major upgrade by Kingston upon Hull Corporation took place in May 1972, when it was extended to pump sewage flows into the Humber as well.|$|R

They destroyed much of the work, as well as buildings and crops, and burnt Skirbeck Sluice.

2500|$|It {{appears that}} Grundy had been acting as Chief Engineer since July 1764. In {{addition}} to the main <b>drain,</b> the <b>scheme</b> involved the construction of [...] of barrier bank, on the east bank of the River Hull, to prevent inundation of the low-lying land from that source. Construction of the bank had begun in July 1764, with John Hoggard acting as Superintendent of the works. In March 1765, work on the main sluice began, and bricklayers, carpenters and masons were employed. The resident engineer or 'Surveyor' for {{this part of the}} work and for the construction of the main drain was Joseph Page, who was paid £80 per year. Throughout the contract, Charles Tate, who had produced the original engraved plan, worked as the land surveyor. Grundy in his capacity as Chief Engineer, visited the sites on four occasions in 1765, and continued to do so until October 1767, when the main drains and sluice were finished. Both he and Page then moved on, but work on the banks and drains continued under the supervision of Hoggard. By the time this first phase was completed in 1772, the cost had been around £24,000.|$|R

40|$|A {{field effect}} {{transistor}} channel charge partitioning scheme is proposed that explains small-signal port parameters associated with the source and <b>drain</b> terminals. The <b>scheme</b> starts with the channel charge, that can be readily extracted from measurement, and defines source charge as that for a drainless channel. The drain charge is the difference required for neutrality. This new approach is a contrast to alternative schemes that apportion part of the channel charge to the source. A significant outcome is the insight that the drain and source charges are larger in magnitude than the channel charge. This is an essential requirement for the correct modelling of reactive parameters not associated with the gate, such as drain-source capacitance, transcapacitance, or transconductance delay. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|WSN are {{distributed}} networks with small, light weight wireless sensor nodes. These sensor nodes cooperatively monitor {{the environment to}} measure the physical parameter such as temperature, pressure etc. It is data centric. When sensor nodes detect an event, it become active in collecting and transmitting the data, which cause congestion and results in packet drops, decrease in throughput and retransmission of data. To ensure the application’s reliability requirements and to reduce the load on the network, WSN need proficient congestion control policies. With this aim, this paper evaluates a contextual cooperative congestion control policy that makes use of the environment information of each node to reduce the channel load, by satisfying the applications requirements. This paper proposes a selective data forwarding scheme to avoid congestion and to optimize the energy <b>drain.</b> The SDFS <b>scheme</b> depends on parameters such as available energy and precedence of the data at the node.

40|$|With the {{discovery}} of ferroelectric hafnium oxide (FE-HfO 2), the ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET), a long-term contender for non-volatile data storage, has finally managed to scale to the 2 x nm technology node. Here for the first time, we correlate the thickness dependent ferroelectric properties of Si:HfO 2 with the memory characteristics of small (56 bit) FeFET arrays. First, an electrical and structural analysis of metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors is given. Even though possessing room-temperature deposited top electrodes, TiN / Si:HfO 2 (20 nm) / TiN capacitors are showing deteriorated polarization characteristics as compared to their 10 nm Si:HfO 2 counterparts. This {{could be attributed to}} an increased monoclinic phase fraction, as indicated by small-signal capacitance voltage and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements. Identical Si:HfO 2 thin films with thicknesses of 10 nm and 20 nm respectively, were utilized in a 28 nm high-k metal-gate CMOS flow to form small FeFET memory arrays of AND architecture. After extracting the most suitable operating conditions from erase matrix, single cell evaluation was performed by standard V-P/ 3 program and a novel V-P/ 3 positive-source <b>drain</b> erase <b>scheme.</b> Array cells incorporating 10 nm Si:HfO 2 films showed a maximum memory window of 1. 03 V whereas cells incorporating 20 nm Si:HfO 2 films could reach up to 1. 57 V.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a vibration-based energy {{scavenging}} system based on piezoelectric conversion for micropower applications. A novel maximum power point (MPP) tracking scheme is proposed to harvest the maximum power from the vibration system. A time-multiplexing mechanism is employed to perform energy harvesting and MPP tracking alternately. In the MPP tracking mode, a voltage reference that represents the optimal output voltage at the MPP is generated. A control unit then uses this reference to track the system operation around the MPP. The proposed system is capable of self-starting up {{without the help of}} an energy buffer. As a result, it is suitable for battery-less applications or when the energy buffer is completely <b>drained.</b> This tracking <b>scheme</b> has very small power overhead and is simple to implement in VLSI. Hence, it is especially applicable for micropower systems. The entire design was fabricated in a 0. 35 -mu m CMOS process.

40|$|Rate based {{congestion}} control {{has been considered}} desirable, both {{to deal with the}} high bandwidth-delay products of today's high speed networks, and to match the needs of emerging multimedia applications. Explicit rate control achieves low loss because sources transmit smoothly at a rate adjusted through feedback to be within the capacity of the resources in the network. However, large feedback delays, presence of higher priority traffic, and varying transient situations make it difficult to ensure feasibility (i. e., keep the aggregate arrival rate below the bottleneck resource's capacity) while also maintaining high resource utilization. These conditions along with the "fast start" desired by data applications often result in substantial queue buildups. We describe a scheme that manages the queue buildup at a switch even under the most aggressive patterns of sources, {{in the context of the}} Explicit Rate option for the Available Bit Rate (ABR) {{congestion control}} scheme. A switch observes the buildup of its queue, and uses it to reduce the portion of the link capacity allocated to sources bottlenecked at that link. We use the concept of a "virtual" queue, which tracks the amount of queue that has been "reduced", but has not yet taken effect at the switch. We take advantage of the natural timing of "resource management" (RM) cells transmitted by sources. The scheme is elegant in that it is simple, and we show that it reduces the queue buildup, in some cases, by more than two orders of magnitude and the queue size remains around a desired target. It maintains max-min fairness even when the queue is being <b>drained.</b> The <b>scheme</b> is scalable, and is as responsive as can be expected: within the constraints of the feedback delay. Finally, nochanges are needed to the ATM Forum defined source/destination policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{north of}} the Vale of Pickering, divides into two obvious regions. In the west, the Vale floor is undulating {{and there is no}} clear break at the {{beginning}} of the higher land, while in the east the Vale floor is flat and ends abruptly with a marked rise to the dip slope of the Tabular Hills. In cultural landscape, these two also differ. The west has small fields, narrow lanes, well wooded hedgerows and scattered villages and townships of dispersed farms, while the east, has larger and more uniform fields, fewer and lower hedges, more ditches, wider and straighter lanes and "street villages" at the junction of the Vale and the higher land. Physically the eastern and western, divisions differ; the west is the dissected valley of the proto-Rye cut into the Kimmeridge clay floor which was flooded for a short time during and after the Pleistocene glaciation. The east was the estuary of the proto-Eye and Hertford, covered by the ice sheet and a lake for a much longer period of time. Historically, the west was divided into compact townships, was more affected by the establishment of monastie granges and was enclosed earlier. The east was divided into elongated townships, the number of these decreased during, the Middle ages; the area was poorly <b>drained</b> until collective <b>schemes</b> were carried out, and most of it was enclosed by Parliamentary enclosure. The farming figures for the 1801 crop returns, the Tithe Awards, and, from 1867, the ten yearly June 4 th Agricultural Returns show the variety and change in the crops grown with changing economic conditions. The real physical divisions into Byedale, Marishes, Carrs, Ings and backslope of the Tabular Hills do not show clearly when the agriculture is studied on a township basis as a variety of conditions is included within the townships of the east but distinction can be made between the east and west of the Vale...|$|R
