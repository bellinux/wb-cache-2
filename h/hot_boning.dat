40|$|Meat from double-muscled Belgian Blue cattle is {{characterized}} by a fast pH decline and slow temperature fall post mortem (pm), which may provoke heat shortening (pH 35 °C) and negatively affect meat quality, particularly in deeper muscles of the hindquarter. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of <b>hot</b> <b>boning</b> (within 2 hours pm) on colour and colour stability and on antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)) in inner and outer Biceps femoris (IBF and OBF) from 7 Belgian Blue young bulls (mean age and carcass weight 22. 7 months and 496 kg respectively). The mean duration of heat shortening was 3. 4 hours for the cold-boned IBF, whereas there was no period of heat shortening in the hot-boned IBF and in the cold- and hot-boned OBF. The colour L*-value was higher in the cold-boned IBF than OBF (49. 3 and 37. 6 respectively; P< 0. 05) resulting in two-toning, whereas there was no significant difference between hot-boned IBF and OBF (33. 8 and 34. 3 respectively).

40|$|Nitric oxide {{influences}} muscle {{physiology and}} meat quality Over the last 15 years, the physiological role of nitric oxide (NO) has gained prominence in biomedical literature, {{emerging as a}} regulator of many cellular processes. Importantly, the formative enzyme NO synthase (NOS) {{was found to have}} high levels of activity in skeletal muscle and the activity of the neuronal isoform of NOS was higher in muscle than in the brain. Roles for NO in the regulation of muscle contractility, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and proteolysis have emerged. Since many of these processes are critical determinants of meat quality, the hypothesis of this thesis is that NO influences physiological determinants of meat quality.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of delayed <b>hot</b> <b>boning</b> time on processed meat conditioned at high ambient temperature. The rate of temperature and pH fall, chemical composition, bacterial load and muscles eating quality were investigated. A total of 10 Baggara bulls were used. The hindquarters of those were divided in three groups. One group was immediately chilled at 2 Cْ for 48 hrs (control) and each of the other two groups was subjected to either three or five hours delayed chilling time at ambient temperature. L. dorsi (LD), Semimembranosus (SM) and Semitendinosus (ST) were hot boned and subsequently chilled at 2 Cْ for 48 hrs, then each one was divided into two parts one part immediately used for chemical and physical analysis and the other aged for 7 days at 2 Cْ till use for analysis. Statistical analysis revealed {{no significant differences between the}} high ambient temperature hot deboning time and aging period in all the studied parameters except the objective of color assessment for all the muscles studied. The chemical composition was significantly (P 0. 05) for the three muscles studied. Water holding capacity of SM, ST and LD was improved insignificantly (P> 0. 05) and there was a significant reduction in cooking loss. Panel test scores indicate that meat from muscles that were early conditioned for 3 and 5 hrs and then hot boned were tender, juicier, flavorful and more acceptable to panelist. The 5 hrs treatment gave highest quality scores. Increasing <b>hot</b> <b>boning</b> time resulted in not significant (P> 0. 05) increase in oxidative rancidity and reduction in total bacterial count in all muscles studied.

40|$|The present chapter {{describes}} {{what is known}} about the effects of the use of electrical stimulation of carcasses of meat animals, including the effects on meat tenderness and meat sensorial characteristics. Electrical stimulation as a process involves passing an electric current through the carcass of freshly slaughtered animals. Electrical stimulation has been extensively used since the 1950 s to hasten the onset of rigor mortis and to modify steps of the glycolytic pathway. Many studies conducted in the USA, in New Zealand, Australia and Europe have involved a variety of electrical stimulation methods on different types of meat animals. Data reported in many studies suggest that electrical stimulation, through hastening rigor changes, can significantly reduce in the carcasses of meat animals the phenomenon of cold shortening, one of the major cause of meat toughness. Although it is well established that electrical stimulation increases the rate of post mortem glycolysis, other biochemical and biophysical effects have been implicated with the use of this technology, including the possibility that electrical stimulation also results in physical disruption of muscle structure. Electrical stimulation can be considered {{as a part of the}} total meat production chain from slaughter to final sale, and has particular advantages for <b>hot</b> <b>boning,</b> where the shortening and toughening conditions that would occur for non stimulated muscles during chilling are avoided...|$|E

Muscle {{characteristics}} were evaluated at various times postmortem. Ultimate pH was not influenced by postmortem temperatures and did not change during storage for either muscle. Sarcomere lengths were shortest at 0 °C and longest at 12 ° C for both muscles, although no difference in lengths was found between 12 and 30 °C in breast. The 30 ° C temperature and longer storage times interacted to produce the greatest drip loss for both muscles. For thigh, the 0 °C postmortem temperature had greater drip losses compared to 12 °C. In a centrifuge water-holding capacity (WHC) test the supernatant weight increased (WHC decreased) with increased storage time, and was greatest at 30 °C for breast and 0 °C for thigh. Supernatant salt soluble protein increased as temperature and storage time increased in both muscles. Cooking yields for thigh homogenates containing water were lower at 0 °C compared to 12 and 30 °C. Cooking yields were lower at 30 °C and increased during storage when breast homogenates contained water, salt and phosphate, while thigh showed lower cooking yields at 0 °C and no change during storage. Increasing the time postmortem before the muscles were chilled increased drip losses and lowered cooking yields of homogenates containing water, salt and phosphate. Shear values of breast slices containing water, salt and phosphate were not influenced by postmortem temperatures of 0 °C and 12 °C.

40|$|During the {{harvesting}} process, {{meat products}} can become contaminated with enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Surrogates for these pathogens {{would be beneficial}} for validating carcass decontamination treatments. Surrogate organisms are organisms that behave similarly to specific pathogens but are non-pathogenic {{and can be used}} to determine efficacy of decontamination regimes for pathogens. The surrogates proposed are non-pathogenic, ampicillin-resistant E. coli biotype I strains that were previously isolated from beef cattle hides. Each E. coli strain was transformed to express a fluorescent protein (red: EcRFP; green: EcGFP; yellow: EcYFP) that is detectable under an ultraviolet light source. Surface areas on <b>hot</b> <b>boned</b> beef carcasses (clod, brisket, outside round) were inoculated with a fecal slurry containing EcRFP, EcGFP, EcYFP and rifampicin-resistant E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium. Surface regions were then treated in a model spray cabinet using an initial water wash (28 ?C) followed by treatments using 2 % L-lactic acid (55 ?C), hot water (95 ?C at source) or a combination of the two. Treatments were compared for their effectiveness at reducing populations of inoculated (4. 7 to 6. 7 log CFU/cm 2) E. coli, S. Typhimurium, EcRFP, EcGFP and EcYFP. Log reductions for inoculated organisms were calculated individually and then total and average surrogate cocktail values were calculated. All decontamination treatments reduced the inoculated numbers of pathogens and surrogates to near or below the detection limit of 0. 5 log CFU/cm 2. The combined treatment resulted in the greatest log reductions. The three individual surrogate organisms varied in log reductions according to the different decontamination treatments applied; however, log reductions for the total surrogate cocktail did not differ significantly from that of E. coli O 157 :H 7. With the exception of EcYFP, the individual surrogates and average surrogate cocktail were significantly more resistant to microbial interventions including lactic acid than S. Typhimurium. Because abattoirs utilize different carcass decontamination treatments, it is difficult for one single fluorescent protein-producing isolate to accurately represent the behavior of E. coli O 157 :H 7 or S. Typhimurium. Instead, surrogates should be used as a total cocktail to accurately represent the effectiveness of different treatments for reduction of enteric pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis had two aims. The first was to develop an instrumental method to measure the softness of raw meat and the second {{was to investigate the}} influence of rapid pH decline and high muscle temperature post-mortem on the water holding capacity (WHC, that is, the muscles' ability to retain fluid) and softness of beef. For the instrumental analysis of muscle softness, different Instron compression (IC) methods were compared to sensory evaluation (SE) of meat. The instrumental methods involved compression of small muscle blocks (approximate size 4 x 5 x 6 cm) parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fibre direction at 20 mm depths and also attaching cylindrical cores of meat (4. 5 cm diameter) to the compression head to prevent the samples from collapsing. The most suitable method was compression of muscle blocks perpendicular to the muscle fibre direction to 5 mm depth, as this method was able to show that rapid pH decline and high muscle temperature gave softer meat than slow pH decline at a lower temperature. However, this method did not correlate with the SE scores; the SE method was not able to differentiate the variation in softness between samples. It was hypothesised that rapid pH decline and high muscle temperature post-mortem would lead to increased protein denaturation, reduced WHC, accelerated meat tenderisation and shortening of sarcomeres and hence soft and exudative meat. It was also hypothesised that these effects would be dependent on the muscle fibre type. In one of the experiments, electrically stimulated (ES) beef Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles were <b>hot</b> <b>boned</b> from the carcasses and incubated in 37 and 14 °C water baths until rigor. We found that the pH decline rate of the muscles subjected to the high temperature was almost double that of the medium temperature treatment with increased protein denaturation, softer muscles and lower WHC. There were no differences in the sarcomere length or tenderness on day 1 or day 3 due to the treatments to indicate accelerated tenderisation. Thus the hypotheses that rapid pH decline and high muscle temperature post-mortem would lead to accelerated tenderisation or sarcomere shortening and subsequently exudative meat were not supported...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{alternating}} frequencies during stimulation {{can increase}} stimulation response of a medium voltage electrical stimulation unit (MVS) {{by increasing the}} rate of pH decline. Various combinations of frequency modulation were tested in experiment 1 to determine the treatment resulting in the greatest stimulation response; the lowest initial pH, fastest rate of pH decline, highest temperature at pH 6 and {{the highest number of}} carcasses with a pH of 6 by 25 oC and the treatment achieving the highest number of carcasses in the pH temp window (temperature at pH 6 between 18 - 25 oC). The objective meat quality of these treatments compared to an unstimulated treatment was tested in experiment 2. Modulating the frequency (Hz) across the 6 segmented electrodes of the MVS by 10, 15, 25, 10, 15, 25 Hz (Treatment 6, using a pulse width: 2. 5 ms, current: 1 A) resulted in the greatest stimulation response. This treatment may be suitable for abattoirs that <b>hot</b> <b>bone</b> sheepmeat and require fast pH declines to ensure minimal cold shortening of meat. However, this treatment did not result in the tenderer meat despite the higher stimulation response. This treatment may have induced a greater number of contractions overall and therefore a greater pH decline response but resulted in less myofibrillar disruption compared to the other treatments due to a concomitant decreased force of contraction thus reducing potential tenderisation. Maintaining a constant frequency of 15 Hz (Treatment 1; pulse width: 2. 5 ms, current: 1 A) resulted in a higher number of carcasses in the pH temp window required (temperature at pH 6 between 18 – 25 oC) in part A (P < 0. 05) and in addition to the higher tenderness levels this treatment may be more appropriate to satisfy the overall demands of abattoirs using these systems. This paper has also demonstrated electrical stimulation results in tenderer meat compared to unstimulated meat even after 30 d of ageing (2. 53 ± 0. 4 compared to 2. 85 ± 0. 1 for the loin (M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum) (P < 0. 01) possibly due to a protective benefit of stimulation on meat tenderness.

The changes in the bone were examined by various methods such as elcation test, bone x-ray, bone scintigraphy, urine hydroxyproline and quantitative bone mineral by computed tomography (QCT). The elcation test was evaluated in 87 patients with multiple myeloma and 15 with osteopor-osis. The maximum value of hypocalcemia induced by elcatonin was ≧ 0. 25 mmol/L which was considered as an abnormal response compared with the mormal response. The elcationin test is related to the prevailing rate of osteoclastic bone resorption. Myeloma patients with advanced bone disease (multiple lytic lesion, Mixed type) had a higher abnormal response such as hypercalcemia, hyper ALP, <b>hot</b> of the <b>bone</b> status, urine hydroxproline and decrease in the bone mineral then myeloma patients with slight bone disease (diffuse proliferation type). Moreover, the elcation test can indicate whether the durg will be effective in the hyper calcemia. We conclude that the elcation test is important in the evaluation of the bone resorption as a simple test for the prognosis and followed up the skeletal disease in the patients with multiple myeloma...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the major}} leading causes of death all over the world. Primary and {{secondary}} bone tumors can significantly deteriorate the quality of life (QOL) and the activity of daily living (ADL) of the patients. These unwelcome diseases become a social and economic burden seriously. Thus, more effective therapies for both primary and secondary bone tumors are actually required. Bone homeostasis depends on the strictly balanced activities between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Imbalance of bone formation and resorption results in various bone diseases. Both primary and secondary bone tumors develop in the unique environment bone, it is therefore necessary to understand bone cell biology in tumoral bone environment. Recent findings strongly revealed the significant involvement of the receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) /RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) triad, the key regulators of bone remodeling in bone oncology. Indeed, RANKL/RANK blocking successfully prevented the development of bone metastases. Furthermore, some cancer cells express RANK which is involved in tumor cell migration. Thus, the regulation of this triad will be a rational, encouraged therapeutic <b>hot</b> spot in <b>bone</b> oncology. In this review, we summarize the accumulating knowledge of the RANKL/RANK/OPG triad and discuss about its therapeutic capability in primary and secondary bone tumors...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we focused on}} {{segmentation}} of thigh muscles. A small explorative series indicated no difference in quantitative results from {{the upper and lower}} body. Likewise, qualitative scores for upper and lower limbs were correlated, signifying a robustness of the data but also suggesting that imaging of the lower body might suffice. This is in line with the practice of performing MRI of the thighs only [39, 40], just as muscle biopsy is usually taken from the quadriceps muscle. Focused SPECT/CT would spare the patients CT radiation as well as time. Muscles of the thighs are quite easily defined by semi-automated methods like ours, whereas automated segmentation of upper limbs is hampered by various adjacent structures with different densities. Inclusion of plethoric structures like large vessels might result in higher count rates. Marked atherosclerosis, which is overrepresented in several rheumatic diseases including IIM [41], may lead to a higher uptake of bone tracers like 99 mTc-PYP. Manual masking of the blood vessels is feasible and seemed, in our case, to increase the SUV difference between patients and controls but also implies a loss of observer independence. Ratios between SUVs of the lower and upper body were slightly above 1 in both patients and controls. A possible explanation is the higher impact of partial volume effect on the smaller muscles of the upper body. Spillover from bone uptake should be omitted [32], which is doable in the thighs and more difficult in the arms. On the other side, safety margins could result in falsely lower count rates if <b>hot</b> spots near <b>bones</b> are abandoned.|$|R
