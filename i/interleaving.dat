Booklet construction was a lightweight cardboard cover stitched on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and <b>interleaving</b> bound in. Until 1956 most booklets had {{half of the}} front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had serial numbers on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the serial numbers ceased.|$|E
5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as <b>interleaving</b> of all modes.|$|E
25|$|However, time <b>interleaving</b> is {{of little}} benefit in slowly fading channels, such as for {{stationary}} reception, and frequency <b>interleaving</b> offers little to no benefit for narrowband channels that suffer from flat-fading (where the whole channel bandwidth fades at the same time).|$|E
40|$|<b>Interleaved</b> {{effects are}} widely documented. Research {{demonstrates}} that <b>interleaved</b> presentation orders, {{as opposed to}} blocked orders typically benefit inductive category learning. What drives <b>interleaved</b> effects is less straightforward. <b>Interleaved</b> presentations provide both the opportunity to compare and contrast between different types of category exemplars, which are temporally juxtaposed, {{and the opportunity to}} space study of the same type of category exemplars, which are temporally separated within the presentation span. Accordingly, <b>interleaved</b> effects might be driven by enhanced discrimination, enhanced memory retention, or both in some measure. Though recent studies have largely endorsed enhanced discrimination as the critical mechanism driving <b>interleaved</b> effects, there is no strong evidence to controvert the contribution of enhanced memory retention for <b>interleaved</b> effects. I further examined the role of memory retention by manipulating both presentation order and category structure. Across two experiments I found that memory retention may drive <b>interleaved</b> effects in categorization tasks...|$|R

25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) <b>interleaving</b> {{increases}} {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth fades, frequency <b>interleaving</b> ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated. Similarly, time <b>interleaving</b> ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bit-stream are transmitted far apart in time, thus mitigating against severe fading as would happen when travelling at high speed.|$|E
25|$|One {{additional}} design {{weakness of}} the two-fluid design was its complex plumbing. ORNL thought it necessary to use complex <b>interleaving</b> of the core and blanket piping {{in order to get}} a high reactor power level with acceptably low power density. More recent research has put into question the need for complex <b>interleaving</b> graphite tubing, suggesting a simple elongated tube-in-shell reactor would allow high total reactor power without complex tubing.|$|E

For example, in an <b>interleaved</b> system with two memory banks (assuming word-addressable memory), if logical address 32 belongs to bank 0, then logical address 33 would belong to bank 1, logical address 34 would belong to bank 0, and so on.

25|$|A {{classical}} type {{of error}} correction coding used with OFDM-based systems is convolutional coding, often concatenated with Reed-Solomon coding. Usually, additional <b>interleaving</b> (on {{top of the}} time and frequency <b>interleaving</b> mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for Reed-Solomon coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and Reed-Solomon codes are inherently well-suited to correcting bursts of errors.|$|E
25|$|When {{activity}} {{recognition is}} performed indoors and in cities using the widely available Wi-Fi signals and 802.11 access points, {{there is much}} noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network model by Yin et al. A multiple goal model that can reason about user's <b>interleaving</b> goals is presented by Chai and Yang, where a deterministic state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and <b>interleaving</b> activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang. A user action discovery model is presented by Yin et al., where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions.|$|E
25|$|Some symbologies use <b>interleaving.</b> The first {{character}} is encoded using black bars of varying width. The second {{character is}} then encoded by varying {{the width of}} the white spaces between these bars. Thus characters are encoded in pairs over the same section of the barcode.

25|$|The {{reason why}} <b>interleaving</b> {{is used on}} OFDM is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bit-stream that is {{presented}} to the error correction decoder, because when such decoders are presented with {{a high concentration of}} errors the decoder is unable to correct all the bit errors, and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs. A similar design of audio data encoding makes compact disc (CD) playback robust.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper <b>interleaving</b> of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains. The system works via {{a series of}} track mounted balises, which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab signal system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interleaved</b> {{comparison}} methods, which compare rankers using click data, are {{a promising}} alternative to traditional information retrieval evaluation methods that require expensive explicit judgments. A major limitation {{of these methods}} is that they assume access to live data, meaning that new data must be collected for every pair of rankers compared. We investigate the use of previously collected click data (i. e., historical data) for <b>interleaved</b> comparisons. We start by analyzing to what degree existing <b>interleaved</b> comparison methods can be applied and find that a recent probabilistic method allows such data reuse, {{even though it is}} biased when applied to historical data. We then propose an <b>interleaved</b> comparison method that is based on the probabilistic approach but uses importance sampling to compensate for bias.

Moreover, {{it is based on}} zero voltage switching technique in which switching takes place when the voltage wave attains zero thus reducing the switching losses.

25|$|<b>Interleaving</b> is used {{to convert}} {{convolutional}} codes from random error correctors to burst error correctors. The basic idea behind the use of interleaved codes is to jumble symbols at the receiver. This leads to randomization of bursts of received errors which are closely located and we can then apply the analysis for random channel. Thus, the main function performed by the interleaver at transmitter is to alter the input symbol sequence. At the receiver, the deinterleaver will alter the received sequence to get back the original unaltered sequence at the transmitter.|$|E
