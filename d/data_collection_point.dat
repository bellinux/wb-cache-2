The conceptual framework used for the study was derived from two sources: an existential theory of nursing, Humanistic Nursing, as developed by Paterson and Zderad (1976). and a set of inductive studies on nurse-adolescent patient interactions (Hinds, 1983). A longitudinal, descriptive-correlational design having three <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> was used. The study sample consisted of 25 adolescents (x age 15. 6 years) receiving inpatient treatment for substance abuse. The <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> occurred at 24 - 48 hours after admission (T₁), 96 - 120 hours before discharge (T₂), and 4 - 5 weeks after discharge (T₃). Adolescents completed visual analogue instruments and responded to a set of open-ended questions indexing the study concepts. Instrumentation data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics and tests of significance for change. Qualitative data resu 1 ting from the interviews were content analyzed. Findings included statistically significant positive relationships between the concepts of caring behaviors of nurses and adolescent hopefulness at T₁, and T₂. Secondly, the relationship between adolescent hopefulness and adolescent health care outcomes was statistically significant at T₃.

40|$|Abstract. Users {{wanting to}} monitor {{distributed}} or component-based systems often perceive them as monolithic systems which, {{seen from the}} outside, exhibit a uniform behaviour as opposed to many components displaying many local behaviours that together constitute the system’s global behaviour. This level of abstraction is often reasonable, hiding implementation details from users who may want to specify the system’s global behaviour {{in terms of an}} LTL formula. However, the problem that arises then is how such a specification can actually be monitored in a distributed system that has no central <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>point,</b> where all the components ’ local behaviours are observable. In this case, the LTL specification needs to be decomposed into sub-formulae which, in turn, need to be distributed amongst the components ’ locally attached monitors, each of which sees only a distinct part of the global behaviour. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for distributing and monitoring LTL formulae, such that satisfac-tion or violation of specifications can be detected by local monitors alone. We present an implementation and show that our algorithm introduces only a minimum delay in detecting satisfaction/violation of a specification.

Aims: In addition to the constructs of a common decision-making model, the theory of planned behaviour, the present study examined the influence of student role identity and university student (ingroup) identification for predicting both the initiation and maintenance of students' attendance at voluntary peer-assisted study sessions in a statistics subject. Sample: University students enrolled in a statistics subject were invited to complete a questionnaire at two time points across the academic semester. A total of 79 university students completed questionnaires at the first <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>point,</b> with 46 students completing the questionnaire at the second <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>point.</b> Method: Twice during the semester, students' attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, student role identity, ingroup identification, and intention to attend study sessions were assessed via on-line questionnaires. Objective measures of class attendance records for each half-semester (or 'term') were obtained. Results: Across both terms, students' attitudes predicted their attendance intentions, with intentions predicting class attendance. Earlier in the semester, in addition to perceived behavioural control, both student role identity and ingroup identification predicted students' attendance intentions, with only role identity influencing intentions later in the semester. Conclusions: These findings highlight the possible chronology that different identity influences have in determining students' initial and maintained attendance at voluntary sessions designed to facilitate their learning.
