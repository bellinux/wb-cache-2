40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} <b>enlarge</b> and <b>display</b> images of picture with high {{precision}} and scal-ability taken by cellular phone on personal computer without producing jaggy noises. One of the major problems we face in image en-largement is the amplification of the jaggy edges. To deal with this problem, we first detect the edges, and approximate them using three kinds of functions in-cluding straight line, arc and quadratic curve. In ad-dition, the color information of the enlarged image is determined by interpolation using quadratic Fluency DA function, which is subsequently merged with the edge information obtained earlier. This enables {{the construction of a}} high precision and scalable image that cannot be produced by conventional image cod-ing method such as JPEG or MPEG. The proposed method is evaluated by applying to images taken by cellular phone equipped with CCD camera to demon-strate its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for visualising the file structures. Our technique uses an enclosure + connection (ENCCON) approach that provides an overall view of the entire file/directory hierarchy that gives {{a better understanding of}} the folder-folder and folder-file relationships, and therefore makes easier for the navigation. We firstly use the rectangular regions to present the folders. This allows the user to immediately percept the location, size (number of files contained) and other properties of any particular folder. To enrich the visual attributes of the file structure, we also use a node- link diagram to present the " belonging" relationships. This " belonging" relationship includes folder-folder and folder-file relationships. We use a semantic zooming technique to <b>enlarge</b> the <b>display</b> of files and folders in a particular focused area. The animation is also accommodated in order to preserve the mental map [Bartram 1997] during the navigation...|$|R
40|$|SummarySubsynaptic {{structures}} such as bouton, active zone, postsynaptic density (PSD) and dendritic spine, {{are highly}} correlated in their dimensions and also correlate with synapse strength. Why this is so and how such correlations are maintained during synaptic plasticity remains poorly understood. We induced spine enlargement by two-photon glutamate uncaging and {{examined the relationship between}} spine, PSD, and bouton size by two-photon time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy. In enlarged spines the PSD-associated protein Homer 1 c increased rapidly, whereas the PSD protein PSD- 95 increased with a delay and only in cases of persistent spine enlargement. In the case of nonpersistent spine enlargement, the PSD proteins remained unchanged or returned to their original level. The ultrastructure at persistently <b>enlarged</b> spines <b>displayed</b> matching dimensions of spine, PSD, and bouton, indicating their correlated enlargement. This supports a model in which balancing of synaptic structures is a hallmark for the stabilization of structural modifications during synaptic plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{intensive}} investigation, no {{clearly defined}} mechanism explaining {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -induced cell killing has emerged. HIV- 1 infection is initiated through a high-affinity interaction between the HIV- 1 external envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) and the CD 4 receptor on T cells. Cell killing is a later event intimately linked by in vitro genetic analyses with the fusogenic properties of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp 120 and transmembrane glycoprotein gp 41. In this report, we describe aberrancies in cell cycle regulatory proteins initiated by cell-cell contact between T cells expressing HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins and other T cells expressing CD 4 receptors. Cells rapidly accumulate cyclin B protein and tyrosine-hyperphosphorylated p 34 cdc 2 (cdk 1) kinase, indicative of cell cycle arrest at G 2 phase. Moreover, these cells continue to synthesize cyclin B protein, <b>enlarge</b> and <b>display</b> an abnormal ballooned morphology, and disappear from the cultures in a pattern previously described for cytotoxicity induced by DNA synthesis (S phase) inhibitors.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to further <b>enlarge</b> the <b>displayed</b> {{stiffness}} range of the impedance-type haptic interfaces. Numerous {{studies have been done}} for a stable haptic interaction in a wide impedance range. However, most of the approaches sacrifice the actual displayed stiffness as a cost of stability. A novel approach, which successively increases the stiffness as the number of interaction cycle increase, is presented. The stiffness is sequentially modulated from a low value to a high value, close to the desired stiffness while maintaining stability. This sequential stiffness increment was possible because the proposed approach guarantees the convergence of the penetration distance and increases the feedback force with every successive interaction cycle. The main advantage of the proposed approach over conventional approaches is that this approach allows much larger actual displayed stiffness than any other approach, such as time-domain passivity approach, force bounding and energy bounding approach. Experiments with PHANToM Premium 1. 5 evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, and compare the actual displayed stiffness with other approaches...|$|R

50|$|Drifting {{is one of}} {{the easier}} types of racing (depending on {{difficulty}} level) in Need for Speed Underground 2. One difference to the drifting mode compared to the original Need for Speed Underground is that the player drifts with the other competitors at the same time. Players race against a maximum of three competitors. Points are awarded when the player successfully slide the car and finishes the drift without hitting any walls or traffic. Like the Street X mode, no nitrous oxide is allowed. There are also some special downhill drift races where the player starts {{at the top of a}} hill and has to slide down from top to bottom, a drifting equivalent of a sprint race (from point A to point B). In these races, there are no other racers, however there is normal city traffic. Players increase their points by sliding past city cars. Drag racing is a point-to-point race that forces players to use a manual transmission. Steering in this mode is simplified to simply allow for lane changes, while the game handles the steering along the lanes, and the player focuses more on maintaining an optimum speed for the car.

40|$|Patients at {{high risk}} for {{developing}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should be enrolled in surveillance programs based on ultrasound (US) examinations performed at 6 -month intervals. Nodules found during US surveillance that are smaller than 1 cm should be followed-up with US at 3 -month intervals. If the nodule found during US surveillance is larger than 1 cm, it should be investigated further with contrast-enhanced dynamic radiological studies, including US, multidetector computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. If the appearance is typical for HCC (i. e., the lesion shows hypervascularization in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or the equilibrium phase), biopsy is considered unnecessary and the lesion can be treated as HCC. For nodules between 1 and 2 cm, it is currently recommended that such non-invasive diagnosis be based on the evidence of coincidental features typical for HCC from at least two dynamic imaging techniques. If the vascular profile on imaging is not characteristic or the nodule is detected in a non-cirrhotic liver, biopsy should be performed. If the biopsy is negative for HCC, patients should be followed-up by imaging studies performed at 3 -month intervals until the nodule either disappears, <b>enlarges,</b> or <b>displays</b> diagnostic characteristics of HC...|$|R

The biodiversity of the consortium depending on the culture conditions and electron and energy source (gasoline, hexane in liquid or hexane in the biofilter) was analyzed using a 16 S rRNA-based approach. Significant differences between the populations were observed, indicating a probable adaptation to the substrate. Two strains, named SP 2 B and SP 72 - 3, isolated from the consortium, belonged to Actinomycetes and demonstrated a high metabolic potential in hexane degradation.

40|$|AbstractFragile X mental {{retardation}} gene (FMR 1) encodes an RNA binding protein {{that acts as}} a negative translational regulator. We have developed a Drosophila fragile X syndrome model using loss-of-function mutants and overexpression of the FMR 1 homolog (dfxr). dfxr nulls <b>display</b> <b>enlarged</b> synaptic terminals, whereas neuronal overexpression results in fewer and larger synaptic boutons. Synaptic structural defects are accompanied by altered neurotransmission, with synapse type-specific regulation in central and peripheral synapses. These phenotypes mimic those observed in mutants of microtubule-associated Futsch. Immunoprecipitation of dFXR shows association with futsch mRNA, and Western analyses demonstrate that dFXR inversely regulates Futsch expression. dfxr futsch double mutants restore normal synaptic structure and function. We propose that dFXR acts as a translational repressor of Futsch to regulate microtubule-dependent synaptic growth and function...|$|R
40|$|RHO 3 and RHO 4 {{are members}} of the ras {{superfamily}} genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are related functionally to each other. Experiments using a conditionally expressed allele of RHO 4 revealed that depletion of both the RHO 3 and RHO 4 gene products resulted in lysis of cells with a small bud, which could be prevented by the presence of osmotic stabilizing agents in the medium. rho 3 rho 4 cells incubated in medium containing an osmotic stabilizing agent were rounded and <b>enlarged</b> and <b>displayed</b> delocalized deposition of chitin and delocalization of actin patches, indicating that these cells lost cell polarity. Nine genes whose overexpression could suppress the defect of the RHO 3 function were isolated (SRO genes). Two of them were identical with CDC 42 and BEM 1, bud site assembly genes involved in the process of bud emergence. A high dose of CDC 42 complemented the rho 3 defect, whereas overexpression of RHO 3 had an inhibitory effect on the growth of mutants defective in the CDC 24 -CDC 42 pathway. These results, along with comparison of cell morphology between rho 3 rho 4 cells and cdc 24 (or cdc 42) mutant cells kept under the restrictive conditions, strongly suggest that the functions of RHO 3 and RHO 4 are required after initiation of bud formation to maintain cell polarity during maturation of daughter cells...|$|R

40|$|The ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) 1 orthologue in the {{divergent}} eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) shares characteristics {{with both}} Arf 1 and Arf 6 {{and has a}} vital role in intracellular protein trafficking. TbARF 1 is Golgi localized in trypanosomes but associates with the plasma membrane when expressed in human cells. Depletion of TbARF 1 by RNA interference causes a major decrease in endocytosis, which correlates with Rab 5 dissociation from early endosomes. Although the Golgi remains intact, parasites <b>display</b> <b>enlarged</b> flagellar pockets and intracellular flagella. An increase in active GTP-bound TbARF 1 in bloodstream parasites is rapidly lethal, correlating with a defect in Golgi-to-lysosome transport.

40|$|Neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4) is {{produced}} by slow muscle fibers in an activity-dependent manner and promotes growth and remodeling of adult motorneuron innervation. However, both muscle fibers and motor neurons express NT- 4 receptors, suggesting bidirectional NT- 4 signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Mice lacking NT- 4 <b>displayed</b> <b>enlarged</b> and fragmented neuromuscular junctions with disassembled postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters, reduced AChR binding, and acetylcholinesterase activity. Electromyographic responses, posttetanic potentiation, and action potential amplitude were also significantly reduced in muscle fibers from NT- 4 knock-out mice. Slow-twitch soleus muscles from these mice fatigued twice as rapidly as those from wild-type mice during repeated tetanic stimulation. Thus, muscle-derived NT- 4 is required for maintenance of postsynaptic AChR regions, normal muscular electrophysiological responses, and resistance to muscle fatigue. This neurotrophin may therefore be {{a key component of}} an activity-dependent feedback mechanism regulating maintenance of neuromuscular connections and muscular performance...|$|R

40|$|Myostatin regulates both {{muscle mass}} and muscle metabolism. The myostatin null (MSTN-/-) mouse has a hypermuscular {{phenotype}} owing to both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the myofibres. The <b>enlarged</b> muscles <b>display</b> {{a reliance on}} glycolysis for energy production; however, enlarged muscles that develop {{in the absence of}} myostatin have compromised force-generating capacity. Recent evidence has suggested that endurance exercise training increases the oxidative properties of muscle. Here, we aimed to identify key changes in the muscle phenotype of MSTN-/- mice that can be induced by training. To this end, we subjected MSTN-/- mice to two different forms of training, namely voluntary wheel running and swimming, and compared the response at the morphological, myocellular and molecular levels. We found that both regimes normalized changes of myostatin deficiency and restored muscle function. We showed that both exercise training regimes increased muscle capillary density and the expression of Ucp 3, Cpt 1 a, Pdk 4 and Err?, key markers for oxidative metabolism. Cross-sectional area of hypertrophic myofibres from MSTN-/- mice decreased towards wild-type values in response to exercise and, in this context, Bnip 3, a key autophagy-related gene, was upregulated. This reduction in myofibre size caused an increase of the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio towards wild-type values. Importantly, both training regimes increased muscle force in MSTN-/- mice. We conclude that impaired skeletal muscle function in myostatin-deficient mice can be improved through endurance exercise-mediated remodelling of muscle fibre size and metabolic profil...|$|R
