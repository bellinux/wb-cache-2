40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} {{metallographic}} examination of Zry- 4 used {{in the manufacture of}} miniplates. The metallographic characterization was performed in order to know the microstructures and microhardness of thereof. These analysis have been carried out for different stages of <b>hot</b> <b>co-rolling,</b> and have been analyzed changes produced in the welding process (method: TIG) to determine in the miniplate if the temperature generated in this stage of manufacture produce changes in the microstructure and microhardness in different areas, from edge to cor...|$|E
40|$|Full-size U- 10 Mo foils {{are being}} {{developed}} for use in high density LEU monolithic fuel plates. The application of a zirconium barrier layer to the foil is performed using a <b>hot</b> <b>co-rolling</b> process. Aluminium clad fuel plates are fabricated using Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) or a Friction Bonding (FB) process. An overview is provided of ongoing technology development activities, including: the co-rolling process, foil shearing/slitting and polishing, cladding bonding processes, plate forming, plate-assembly swaging, and fuel plate characterization. Characterization techniques being employed include, Ultrasonic Testing (UT), radiography, and microscopy...|$|E
40|$|A down-selection {{process has}} been applied to the U-Mo fuel alloy based {{monolithic}} plate fuel design, supported by irradiation testing of small fuel plates containing various design parameters. The irradiation testing provided data on fuel performance issues such as swelling, fuel-cladding interaction (interdiffusion), blister formation at elevated temperatures, and fuel/cladding bond quality and effectiveness. U- 10 Mo (wt%) was selected as the fuel alloy of choice, accepting a somewhat lower uranium density for the benefits of phase stability. U- 7 Mo could be used, with a barrier, where the trade-off for uranium density is critical to nuclear performance. A zirconium foil barrier between fuel and cladding was chosen to provide a predictable, well-bonded, fuel-cladding interface, allowing little or no fuel-cladding interaction. The fuel plate testing conducted to inform this selection was based on the use of U- 10 Mo foils fabricated by <b>hot</b> <b>co-rolling</b> with a Zr foil. The foils were subsequently bonded to Al- 6061 cladding by hot isostatic pressing or friction stir bonding...|$|E
