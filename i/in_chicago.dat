5|$|Beilhart preached <b>in</b> <b>Chicago</b> and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press.

The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E
