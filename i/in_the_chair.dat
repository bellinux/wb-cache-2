They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E

For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown.|$|E
