5|$|During the {{afternoon}} that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought {{to assess the}} situation {{and to work with}} Khalil on a plan to counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti-tank weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking anti-tank weapons; it had been stripped of its anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the <b>east</b> <b>bank.</b> Several measures decided upon were not implemented however.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, {{the heads}} of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, {{continued}} to press Sharon to send forces to the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He retorted with the claim that {{had it not been}} for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by now. When his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the <b>east</b> <b>bank.</b> As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} on the <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made {{a more accurate}} survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} <b>east</b> <b>bank</b> that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E
