5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, {{commander}} of the Channel Squadron, transferred his flag to Agincourt as her sister Minotaur, his former flagship, was taken in <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> refit that lasted until 1875. That year Agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re-armament that lasted until 1877. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat. Agincourt served as the flagship for his second-in-command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in February 1878. After those tensions faded, the ship returned to the Channel, where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. Over her active career, she served as flagship to no less than 15 admirals. That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893, when she was transferred to Portland {{for use as a}} training ship.|$|E
5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out with his left <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho snatched the ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew more into the game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating more chances – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E

5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|Dryad’s first {{commission}} {{ended on}} 26 April 1872, when Commander Parsons {{left her in}} Devonport. Normal practice of the time was for the ship's company to leave the ship upon decommissioning, {{with the exception of}} a few specialists, including the shipwright and gunner, who would have been accommodated in another vessel. The dockyard would have taken her in <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> refit, and she would have recommissioned, with a new captain and crew, on completion.|$|E
25|$|For a flow with an {{upstream}} Mach number {{greater than}} 1.0 in a sufficiently long enough duct, deceleration occurs {{and the flow}} can become choked. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> flow with an upstream Mach number less than 1.0, acceleration occurs and the flow can become choked in a sufficiently long duct. It can be shown that for flow of calorically perfect gas the maximum entropy occurs at M= 1.0. Fanno flow is named after Gino Girolamo Fanno.|$|E
25|$|Kepler's third law {{describes}} {{the motion of}} two bodies orbiting a common center of mass. It relates the orbital period (the {{time it takes to}} complete one full orbit) with the distance between the two bodies (the orbital separation), and the sum of their masses. For a given orbital separation, a higher total system mass implies higher orbital velocities. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> given system mass, a longer orbital period implies a larger separation and lower orbital velocities.|$|E

The second XG-20, however, was taken in <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more radical reconfiguration, being fitted with two twin-jet engine pods, of the type used by the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 bombers, to become the XC-123A. As there was no provision for housing fuel in the former glider's wings, fuel tanks were installed underneath the cabin floor.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E

25|$|The first {{buildings}} at St. Peter's Mission were spartan. With assistance {{from some of}} the Métis and, occasionally, soldiers from nearby Fort Shaw, the priests built a one-story rectangular chapel out of logs, which were stripped of bark and roughly squared off by <b>hand.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> time the chapel doubled as sleeping quarters for the priests. A second square-log building attached to the chapel was quickly constructed to serve as sleeping quarters and kitchen. This structure doubled the mission's size. By the end of 1881, the priests had constructed several small log cabins to serve as individual priestly residences. They attached these to the west end of the expanded chapel, creating an L-shaped structure.|$|E
25|$|Based on the feature/aspects and {{the sentiments}} {{extracted}} from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed. There {{are two types of}} motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item.|$|E

500|$|After {{the virtual}} {{closure of the}} Chinese market, Bovet {{continued}} to manufacture pocket watches, though at a much reduced rate, and would frequently offer its manufacturing services on a contract basis to other watch companies. The Landry Freres purchased Bovet in 1888 but did not invest in it. [...] In 1901, the Bovet trademark was sold at auction in Paris to Cesar and Charles Leuba, sons of Ami Leuba. [...] Jacques Ullmann and Co., another successful produce of watches for the Chinese market, purchased the Bovet brand in 1918. After Jacques Ullmann {{went out of business}} in 1932, the Bovet name was acquired by Albert and Jean Bovet, who were successful watch makers and registered several patents for chronographs, such as the mono rattrapante—a device that would pause the second <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reading while the mechanism continued to run. [...] The company Favre-Leuba purchased the name and manufacturing facilities from the Bovet brothers in 1948.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics for both Guetta's catchy production and Rowland's strong vocals. It {{was called the}} strongest and most commercial single choice from Guetta's album, One Love. Critics noted that the song's opening piano riff {{was similar to that}} from Coldplay's hit single [...] "Clocks" [...] (2002). David Jefferes of Allmusic gave the song a thumbs up saying, calling [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] one of the strongest songs from One Love and praising the [...] " [...] the powerful voice of Kelly Rowland for one grand, uplifting floor-filler." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly agreed calling the song the [...] "most memorable from the album" [...] and recalling [...] "Clocks" [...] by Coldplay to make [...] "a showstopper starring Kelly Rowland." [...] Michael Hibbard of MusicOMH was impressed with both the production and vocal work on [...] "When Love Takes Over". He pointed out the rarity in the amount of promotion given to the song, referring to [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] being given [...] "its own poster on the Tube." [...] He also described the song as a [...] "euphoric masterpiece" [...] backed by [...] "at least eight remixes [...] " [...] and the accompany vocals from [...] "Destiny's Child songbird Kelly Rowland on <b>hand</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> diva masterclass." [...] Also agreeing with these comments was Fraser McAlpine from BBC Online who awarded the song four out of five stars. [...] "The genius ingredients include a thinly reworked go at the piano riff to 'Clocks' by Coldplay and handclaps ... And the fairy dust is...well...it's your standard dance-pop production, actually." [...] However he noted that the production was [...] "tastefully done {{to make sure that the}} good bits are not spoilt". Other elements of the song such as the [...] "bed of synthistrings, a skippy beat, a breakdown, some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic, cinematic bottom end drone" [...] were praised. McAlpine also praised Rowland's appearance on the track, commenting who she sounded [...] "entirely unlike herself, so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny." [...] He described the marriage of Rowland's vocals and Guetta's production by stating that [...] " [...] got a spiralling, sky-scraping melody to sing too." ...|$|E
