40|$|Improving the {{reliability}} of wind turbines (WT) is an essential component in the bid to minimize the cost of energy, especially for offshore wind because of the difficulties associated with access for maintenance. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} WT gearbox and generator failure rates are unacceptably high, particularly given the long downtime incurred per failure. There is evidence that bearing failures of the gearbox high-speed stage (HSS) and generator account for a significant proportion of these failures. However, the root causes of these failure data are not known, and there is therefore a need for fundamental computational studies to support the valuable ‘top down’ reliability analyses. In this paper, a real (proprietary) 2 [*]MW geared WT was modelled to compute the gearbox–generator misalignment and predict the impact of this misalignment upon the gearbox HSS and generator bearings. At rated torque, misalignment between the gearbox and generator of 8500 [*]µm was seen. For the 2 [*]MW WT analysed, the computational data show that the L 10 fatigue lives of the gearbox HSS bearings were not significantly affected by this misalignment but that the L 10 fatigue lives of the generator bearings, particularly the <b>drive-end</b> bearing, could be significantly reduced. It is proposed to apply a nominal offset to the generator to reduce the misalignment under operation, thereby reducing the loading on the gearbox HSS and generator bearings. The value of performing integrated system analyses has been demonstrated, and a robust methodology has been outlined...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 09 / 03 / 1999. For many companies, design related information mainly exists as rooms of paper-based archives, typically {{in the form of}} manufacturing drawings and technical specifications. This 'static' information cannot be easily reused. The work presented in this thesis proposes a methodology to ease this problem. It defines and implements a computer-based design tool that will enable existing design families to be transformed into 'dynamic' CAD-based models for the Conceptual, Embodiment and Detailed stages of the design process. Two novel concepts are proposed here, i) the use of a Function Means Tree to store Conceptual and Embodiment design and ii) a Variant Method to represent Detailed design. In this way a definite link between the more abstract conceptual and the concrete detailed design stages is realised by linking individual detailed designs to means in the Function Means Tree. The use of the Variant Method, incorporating 'state-of-the-art' developments in Solid Modelling, Feature-Based Design and Parametric Design, allows an entire family of designs to be represented by a single Master Model. Therefore, instances of this Master Model need only be stored as a set of design parameters. This enables current design families and new design cases to be more created more efficiently. Industrial Case Studies, including a Lathe Chuck family, a <b>Drive-End</b> casting and a family of Filtration Systems are given to prove the methodology...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 1990 ´s pod {{propulsion}} in marine applications have become common. There are mainly two manufactures on the pod market. ABB is the biggest producer and has two types of pod-types, Azipod (5 - 30 MW) and Compact (0. 4 - 5 MW). Rolls-Royce (RR) is the second biggest company on the market, producing a pod called Mermaid (5 - 25 MW). The electrical system in pod propulsion normally consists of a transformer, a frequency converter and an electric motor. The transformer is used to divide the system into several parts in order to obtain different voltage levels but also for phase shift voltages for the used rectifiers. The purpose of the frequency converter is to control the speed and torque of the motor by changing a constant frequency from the main generator into variable frequency for the motor. The electric motor is used for conversion from electrical to mechanical power for the propeller. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and dry type transformer. The non-drive end bearing is insulated and the shaft is grounded to earth in drive end and to the bearing housing in non-drive end. Mermaid has a dry type transformer and a synchronous motor controlled by a load commutated inverter (LCI). Both bearings are insulated and the shaft is grounded at the <b>drive-end.</b> The biggest change in pod propulsion within the foreseeable future is a switch to voltage source inverter with pulse-width-modulation (VSI-PWM). Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are an alternative in smaller pods and the development of magnets can make PMSM to an alternative for bigger pods. In addition, induction motors is an alternative motor in the future. I...|$|E
40|$|The Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch at the NASA Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a three-axis high-temperature magnetic bearing suspension rig to enhance {{the safety of the}} bearing system up to 1000 F. This test rig can accommodate thrust and radial bearings up to a 22. 84 cm (9 in.) diameter with a maximum axial loading of 22. 25 kN (5000 lb) and a maximum radial loading up to 4. 45 kN (1000 lb). The test facility was set up to test magnetic bearings under high-temperature (1100 F) and high-speed (20, 000 rpm) conditions. The magnetic bearing is located at the center of gravity of the rotor between two high-temperature grease-packed mechanical ball bearings. The <b>drive-end</b> duplex angular contact ball bearing, which is in full contact, acts as a moment release and provides axial stability. The outboard end ball bearing has a 0. 015 -in. radial clearance between the rotor to act as a backup bearing and to compensate for axial thermal expansion. There is a 0. 020 -in. radial air gap between the stator pole and the rotor. The stator was wrapped with three 1 -kW band heaters to create a localized hot section; the mechanical ball bearings were outside this section. Eight threaded rods supported the stator. These incorporated a plunger and Bellville washers to compensate for radial thermal expansion and provide rotor-to-stator alignment. The stator was instrumented with thermocouples and a current sensor for each coil. Eight air-cooled position sensors were mounted outside the hot section to monitor the rotor. Another sensor monitored this rotation of the outboard backup bearing. Ground fault circuit interrupts were incorporated into all power amplifier loops for personnel safety. All instrumentation was monitored and recorded on a LabView-based data acquisition system. Currently, this 12 -pole heteropolar magnetic bearing has 13 thermal cycles and over 26 hr of operation at 1000 F...|$|E

There are two categories of causes of bearing current, a classical problem where low frequency current and a newer high frequency current problem that occur when using high switching control. To mitigate currents in bearings grounding of the shaft and insulation of the bearings is used. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and dry-type transformer.
