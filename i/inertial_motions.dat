In our previous research, a method for generating a timed knee trajectory close to able-bodied individuals, which leads to sufficient clearance between the foot and the floor and the knee extension, was proposed using the <b>inertial</b> <b>motion.</b> Limb motions are known to correlate with each other during walking. This phenomenon is called kinematic synergy. In the present study, we measure gaits in level walking of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of walking velocities.

We then propose a new method for generating the motion of the knee joint using its <b>inertial</b> <b>motion</b> close to the able-bodied individuals in mid-swing based on its kinematic synergy, such that the method can adapt to the changes in the motion velocity. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method achieves prosthetic walking similar to that of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of constant walking velocities and termination of walking from steady-state walking. Further investigations have found that a kinematic synergy also exists at the start of walking.

40|$|In {{the real}} {{world in which we}} move around, <b>inertial</b> and visual <b>motion</b> are usually equal; {{what you see is what}} you feel. In a simulator, however, this is usually not the case. On the contrary, due to the {{relatively}} small motion space of even the largest simulators, the <b>inertial</b> <b>motion</b> cues must be filtered and scaled down considerably. Typically, <b>inertial</b> <b>motion</b> cues are high-pass filtered and scaled down by as much as fifty to seventy percent in a flight simulator. This does not necessarily mean that the motion simulation is unnatural or unconvincing, since certain differences between <b>inertial</b> and visual <b>motion</b> cannot be detected by the human perceptual system. Especially, when the visual scene has rich content with a lot of detail, high-contrast and a wide field-of-view. The maximum allowable difference between visual and <b>inertial</b> <b>motion</b> that goes undetected is defined as the visual-vestibular coherence zone. Knowledge of these coherence zones is very valuable for the development of effective simulator motion cueing. The results of the yaw motion perception experiment described in this paper provide strong indications that the coherence zone between visual and <b>inertial</b> yaw <b>motion</b> is not simply determined by a simple gain or threshold, but is frequency dependent. From a perception modeling point-of-view one can argue that the frequency dependency is related to the inverse dynamics of the semi-circular canals. The experimental findings support this argument, although further research is required to determine a more precise dynamic coherence zone and to test other degrees-of-freedom.
