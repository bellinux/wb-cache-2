He declines making any previous engagements. He seeks no customers, but rather conveys the idea that he would prefer to be let alone.

2500|$|Most significantly, {{the desire}} to {{dominate}} others is what motivates the Crawfords. Henry Crawford is attracted to Fanny Price because he cannot fathom her mind, and is obsessed with [...] "knowing" [...] her, to destroy her identity and remake her into his own image of what he wants her to be, making him in many respects in Edwards's viewpoint the most monstrous of Austen's villains as he wants to erase Fanny's identity just to please his own vanity. Mary Crawford is likewise in her relations with Edmund is not prepared to accept him as he is, but only to remade into her own image of what a man should be. Edwards argued Austen could have easily titled Mansfield Park Conscience and Consciousness as the novel's main conflict is the struggle between conscience, what people really feel in their souls, and consciousness, which understood {{at the time to}} mean [...] "having one's thoughts and attention unduly centered in one's own personality". The climactic struggle of the novel is Henry's efforts to win Fanny so he could impose his will on her, to remake her as he would like her to be, and Fanny's efforts to maintain her identity. Even when Henry tries to please Fanny as when renounces acting and discusses Shakespeare, he is still acting as <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>a</b> careful watch on Fanny's reaction, measuring his every word and the reaction on her face. Edwards wrote that the theatrical aspect of Henry, the man who is always acting {{can be seen in the}} way in which he considers careers in the Church of England and the Royal Navy after encounters with Edmund and William respectively, a man who has no identity of his own and who constantly reinvents himself.|$|E

These, and other various conjectures of equal importance, engrossed the attention of Mrs. Malderton and her daughters during the whole morning after church.|$|R
