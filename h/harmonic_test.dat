I hereby present two {{different}} methods {{that will allow}} weak lensing shape measurements of galaxies combined with redshift information – 3 D weak lensing – to constrain the dark energy equation of state.

40|$|Abstract – ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> signal. The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require test signal distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC – the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs. More sophisticated approach to ADC testing applies the correction for test signal imperfections. In both cases test signal distortion has to be known – roughly in the first case and quite accurately in the second case. In this paper an easy method for the testing of signal spectral purity is proposed. Test signal passed by one of two simple analog filters is measured by a common ADC, whose nonlinearity is mathematically post-corrected. The results are compared with common approach applying notch filter and uncertainty analysis is performed. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> was {{introduced}} in the early 1970 's as a special case of pulse testing. It is characterized by a periodic variation of production/injection rate. Subsequent developments proved that it could provide the same information as a conventional well test (permeability and skin, heterogeneity) in addition to those given by a pulse test (areal connectivity within the reservoir) if proper interpretation models were adopted. Consequently, it can be considered as a promising methodology to test a well during ongoing field operations without stopping production and thus it is very attractive for monitoring well performance, especially of gas storage wells. Initially applied to oil wells, <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> has recently been extended to gas wells for which the assumption of Darcy flow regime is no longer valid because of inertial phenomena and/or turbulence. <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> for gas wells comprises three or more consecutive sequences of pulses characterized by increasing average rate, similar to a Flow After Flow test. The interpretation of a single-well <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>test</b> is based on the derivative approach in the frequency domain to obtain kh and the skin components (mechanical skin and D factor).

The increasing damping was associated with the breaking of hydrogen bonds and the formation of free volume within polymer networks. The changes of loss modulus ratio at 1 and 20 Hz, E″ 1 Hz/E″ 20 Hz, proved the changing trend of the unstable state. Higher ramping rates aggravated the unstable state at the RHramp period, and higher constant RH levels provided more recovery of the unstable state at the RHisohume period.

The transducer consisted of a 1 - 3 PMN-PT/epoxy composite with two quarter wave matching layers and a backing. The transducer face was spherically curved to yield a 53 mm focal point.

The transmit response for tone burst excitation indicated a shift in center frequency to 6. 5 MHz and a- 6 dB bandwidth of 100 %. Receive sensitivity was high {{at the lower end}} of the band and decreased with increasing frequency; this behavior was probably due to electrical impedance mismatch.

40|$|For decades, well {{tests have}} been widely used in the oil {{industry}} for evaluation of well productivity and reservoir properties, which provide key information for field development and facilities design. In conventional well tests equilibrium conditions are required in the reservoir before the test.

Method. Thirteen newborn lambs weighing 2. 5 « 0. 4 kg (mean « SD) were premedicated, intubated, anesthetized, and then placed under TLV using a specially-design liquid ventilator and a perfluorocarbon. The respiratory mechanics measurements protocol was started immediately after TLV initiation. Three blocks of measurements were first performed: one during initial respiratory system adaptation to TLV, followed by two others series during steady state conditions. Lambs were then {{divided into two groups}} prior to undergoing another three blocks of measurements: the first group received a 10 -min i v infusion of salbutamol (1. 5 [micro]g/kg/min) after continuous infusion of methacholine (9 [micro]g/kg/min) while the second group of lambs were chest-strapped. Respiratory impedance was measured using serial single-frequency tests at frequencies ranging between 0. 05 - 2 Hz and then fitted with a constant-phase model. 0. 2 Hz <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> signals were also launched every ten minutes throughout the measurement protocol.

30|$|The last {{block of}} the note {{decision}} stage includes some <b>harmonic</b> <b>tests</b> {{to perform the}} final decision. One {{of the problems in}} polyphonic detection is the detection of the octave and perfect fifth since many errors occur due to either missing notes or, especially, to the appearance of false positives [26, 27]. This is due to the overlapping between harmonic partials of different sounds. Assuming ideal harmonicity, it is known that harmonic partials of two sounds coincide if and only if the fundamental frequencies of the two sounds are in rational number relations [28, 29]. When the harmonicity is not ideal, the overlapping continues since the partials of the notes may exhibit appreciable bandwidth. On the other hand, an important principle in Western music is that simple harmonic relationships are favored over dissonant ones {{in order to make the}} sounds blend better [21]. This is the case of octaves and fifths. These intervals are the ones whose harmonious relationships are the simplest (2 [*]:[*] 1 and 3 [*]:[*] 2) and these are also the two most frequent intervals in Western music [30].|$|R

40|$|Harmonic pulse {{testing is}} a well testing {{technique}} in which the injection or production rate is varied in a periodic way. The pressure response to the imposed rates, both in the pulser well and in the observer wells, can be analyzed in the frequency domain to evaluate the reservoir properties. The advantages {{of this type of}} test are that dedicated well testing surface equipment is not required and that the test can be performed during ongoing field operations. In an earlier study we demonstrated that the harmonic pulse testing methodology can be used to evaluate the effective permeability to hydrocarbons and the reservoir total compressibility even for such a heterogeneous case as in a water injection scenario. The analysis can be performed using a numerical simulator in the Fourier domain, by which heterogeneities can be explicitly taken into account. As time-stepping is not required in such a simulation, calculations are much faster than calculations in the time domain. In the present paper we report on the application of the methodology to two field cases. The first case is a gas storage reservoir, operated with a day-night injection-shut in scenario. Data analysis proved that the reservoir was homogeneous and that a minor fault identified by the seismic was not hindering hydraulic communication between the pulser and the observer wells. The second case is a set of <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> experiments on three groundwater wells, the details of which have been published earlier together with a first attempt to interpret the data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the response of}} a full-scale dry-stack masonry structure subject to earthquake loads. The following earthquakes were applied {{to the base of}} the structure: (a) North Ridge, (b) Llolleo, (c) El Centro and (d) Llolleo for the second time. The earthquake displacement signals had to be filtered by removing the slow-varying frequency components so that the available servo-hydraulic test machine could be used. The filtering produced acceptably low error when comparing the applied histories with the real earthquake histories. A 4 x 4 m structure was constructed on a 1 o of freedom shake table out of mortarless interlocking bricks with minimum reinforcement. A 2 560 kg mass was superimposed on the structure to model the roof. The test structure was instrumented with accelerometers and LVDTs. The results showed that the simulated Llolleo earthquakes caused the most damage. This damage was minor: several bricks cracked, other bricks shifted, vertical gaps opened up between the bricks, and the skim plaster spalled in several places. The Llolleo earthquake damage was estimated to be Grade 2 on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS). During the earthquake simulations the walls deflected up to 42 mm. However, the maximum permanent deformation recorded due to bricks shifting was only 4, 6 mm - a small fraction of the wall thickness. Although the peak ground acceleration (PGA) was 0, 7 g, the maximum acceleration experienced by the structure at a door opening was 3, 4 g. The tests were concluded by applying two harmonic base excitations. The first 5 Hz <b>harmonic</b> <b>test,</b> which corresponded to the undamaged structure's resonant frequency, produced less damage than the Llolleo earthquake. The second 15 s, 3 Hz sinusoidal base motion, which corresponded to the damaged structure's resonant frequency, caused major damage (EMS Grade 4). Despite major cracks in two walls forming the characteristic "X" failure, the structure continued to support the roof mass. Video analysis clearly demonstrated that dry stacking can result in large brick movements when the base is excited. The ability of the test structure to withstand the applied earthquakes and base harmonic motions is attributed to energy absorption and dissipation due to inter-brick friction and bricks cracking and crushing...|$|E
40|$|The newly {{developed}} differential quadrature method (DQM) {{is applied to}} the problem of linear elastic budding of circular cylindrical shells and tanks.

For the first time the DQM {{is applied to the}} buckling problem of cylindrical shells and also {{for the first time the}} 2 -dimensional DQM with two different test functions (polynomial and <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> functions) is applied to the structural mechanics problems with circumferential continuity. As well for the first time the nonsymmetrical form of the buckling equations is derived based on the Flugge theory and used for analyzing nonsymmetric buckling problem of tanks under quasi static earthquake loading. Both the 1 -dimensional and 2 -dimensional DQM are used. In the 1 -dimensional part, the fields (U, V, W) are expressed as products of unknown functions along the axial direction and known trigonometric functions along the circumferential direction. In the 2 -dimensional part, the displacement fields are represented by unknown functions in two directions. The derivatives in both the governing equations and the boundary conditions are discretized by the DQM. In this process the governing differential equations and boundary conditions are transformed into a set of algebraic equations, the eigenvalues of which are the buckling loads of the shell or the tank. In the 2 -dimensional part, shells under single and combined loads are considered. The latter load represents the tanks containing liquid under quasistatic earthquake loading. The accuracy and efficiency of the DQM is examined by comparing the results with those in the literature. The results of 1 -dimensional DQM are in good agreement with the work of other researchers. In the 2 -dimensional problems, while an overall convergence is observed, in some cases a complete convergence is not obtained. The size of the matrices in the 2 -dimensional DQM is an order of magnitude larger than those in one dimension, yet good results have been found for tanks under earthquake loading in the last part where more accurate equations and boundary conditions are used.

Current tests show the presence friction at low input levels, which is associated with the gearbox. The output voltage and the harvested power of the device are studied experimentally for different values of load. By increasing the value of the load from zero (short circuit) to high values (open circuit) the swing angle increases, while the harvested power presents a peak associated with the electrical damping. Also, <b>harmonic</b> <b>tests</b> are run at resonance for different levels of excitation to demonstrate the effect of the nonlinearity on the voltage and the harvested power. A nonlinear load resistance, is then introduced as part of future work. The aim is to try to increase the harvested power with respect to the linear load, at low level of excitation...|$|R
