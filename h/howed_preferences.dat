40|$|In {{the context}} of {{database}} queries, computational methods for handling preferences can be broadly divided into two categories. Query personalization methods consider that user preferences are provided as a user profile separately from the query and dynamically determine how this profile will affect the query results. On the other hand, preferential query answering methods consider that preferences are explicitly expressed within queries. The focus of this chapter is on query personalization methods. We will first describe <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> can be represented and stored in user profiles. Then, we will discuss <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> are selected from a user profile and applied to a query. ...|$|R

This paper presents a novel extension to abductive reasoning in causal nets, namely {{the use of}} domain {{knowledge to}} select among alternative diagnoses. We describe <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> among multiple causes of a given state can be {{expressed in terms of}} causal nets, and <b>how</b> these <b>preferences</b> can be used to select among alternative diagnoses. We investigate this new extension by proving a number of properties, and show <b>how</b> our <b>preference</b> scheme interacts with conventional ways of choosing among competing diagnoses. Our extension increases the expressive power of causal nets, enjoys a number of desirable properties, and compares favourably with existing proposals for expressing preferential knowledge in causal nets. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} asprin 1, a general, flexible, and extensible framework for handling preferences among the stable models of a logic program. We show <b>how</b> complex <b>preference</b> relations {{can be specified}} through user-defined preference types and their arguments. We describe <b>how</b> <b>preference</b> specifications are handled internally by so-called preference programs which are used for dom-inance testing.

40|$|This paper studies <b>how</b> a <b>preference</b> for {{consistency}} can affect economic decisionmaking. We propose a two-period model {{where people have}} a preference {{for consistency}} because consistent behavior allows them to signal personal and intellectual strength. We then present three experiments that study main predictions and implications of the model. The first is a simple principal-agent experiment that shows that consistency is valued by others and that this value is anticipated. The second experiment underlines the crucial role of early commitment for consistency preferences. Finally we show <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> for consistency {{can be used to}} manipulate choices. charitable giving; consistency preferences; early commitment; experiments; social influence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} a rapidly growing interest in the biological basis of human mate choice. Here we review recent studies that demonstrate preferences for traits which might reveal genetic quality to prospective mates, with potential but still largely unknown influence on offspring fitness. These include studies assessing visual, olfactory and auditory preferences for potential good-gene indicator traits, such as dominance or bilateral symmetry. Individual differences in these robust preferences mainly arise through within and between individual variation in condition and reproductive status. Another set of studies have revealed preferences for traits indicating complementary genes, focussing on discrimi-nation of dissimilarity at genes in the major histocompat-ibility complex (MHC). As in animal studies, we are only just beginning to understand <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> for specific traits vary and inter-relate, how consideration of good and compatible genes can lead to substantial variability in individual mate choice decisions and <b>how</b> <b>preferences</b> ex-pressed in one sensory modality may reflect those in an-other.

Perhaps {{the most important part of}} this analysis is that by exploring <b>how</b> time <b>preferences</b> change with sexual behavior, one could potentially invent ways that would reduce risky sexual behavior by altering time preferences.|$|R

We propose a general framework that overcomes those limitations. I...|$|R
