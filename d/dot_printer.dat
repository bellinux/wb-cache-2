50|$|A {{variation}} on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer <b>dot</b> <b>printer,</b> patented by Seikosha in 1982. The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer {{was replaced by a}} spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.|$|E

5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line matrix printers used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. <b>Dot</b> matrix <b>printers,</b> also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. <b>Dot</b> matrix <b>printers</b> are divided on two main groups: serial <b>dot</b> matrix <b>printers</b> and line matrix [...] printers.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{describes}} three {{electronic devices}} {{designed for use}} in the Skylab airlock module: the teleprinter system, the quartz crystal microbalance contamination monitor (QCM), and the speaker. Design considerations, operation, characteristics, and system development are described for these systems, with accompanying diagrams, graphs, and photographs. The teleprinter is a thermal <b>dot</b> <b>printer</b> used to produce hard copy messages by electrically heating print elements in contact with heat-sensitive paper. The QCM was designed to estimate contamination buildup on optical surfaces of the earth resources experiment package. A vibrating quartz crystal is used as a microbalance relating deposited mass to shifts in the crystal's resonant frequency. Audio devices provide communication between crew members and between crew and STDN, and also provide audible alarms, via the caution and warning system, of out-of-limit-conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} an out-patients data handling system utilizing a microcomputer (MCP) which enables physicians to input the {{data obtained from}} out-patients simultaneously (on real-time) and take out necessary data when required. MZ- 80 B with 2 KB ROM (read only memory) and 64 KB RAM (random access memory) were used for MCP. A 1. 12 MB registration disc device, MZ- 80 FD, and <b>dot</b> <b>printer</b> MZ- 80 BP 5 were also installed. The data to be input are basic information about the patient (patients name and 4 other items), past history, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and prescription. The input data are processed by the programs made for disease statistics, age-sex statistics access to patient's cards classified by disease, drugs used, symptoms and urinary findings. By employing this system, access to patient's data was speeded up and quality of examination and treatment was improved and standardized. In the future MCP data handling system will be further improved by introducing the multi-system approach and introducing various terminal devices such as a graphic display and digitizer...|$|E

5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the <b>dot</b> matrix <b>printer</b> rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived <b>printers,</b> daisywheel <b>printers,</b> <b>dot</b> matrix <b>printers</b> and line <b>printers.</b> <b>Dot</b> matrix <b>printers</b> remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed.

50|$|In the 1970s, the <b>dot</b> matrix <b>printer</b> (which {{was much}} like a typewriter) was used to {{reproduce}} varied fonts and arbitrary graphics.
