25|$|Animal consciousness, {{or animal}} awareness, {{is the quality}} or state of {{self-awareness}} within an animal, or of being aware of an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> or something within itself. In humans, consciousness has been defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, qualia, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers {{believe there is a}} broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.|$|E
50|$|Gautama Buddha is {{believed}} to have directed all monks and scholars to thoroughly analyze his words and not adopt them for the sake of respect. He taught rationalism and trust in one's own reasoning and belief, and spoke about the distinction between the mere reception of truth and the knowledge of truth which involves rational conviction. The later Buddhist thinkers such as the Sautrantikas, opposed to the Yogacaras who deny the reality of <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> reducing them to cognitions, advocating indirect realism recognized the reality of <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> which produced their own cognitions and imprinted their forms on them as being basically perceptible; they developed the doctrine of impermanence into the ontological doctrine of momentariness Dharmakirti considered the so-called <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> as mere sensations, that all object-cognitions are due to the revival of the sub-conscious impressions deposited in the mind which are not excited by <b>external</b> <b>objects.</b> The Madhyamakas regard <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> and subjective cognitions to be equally essenceless with Sunya as their eternal basis and reject the plurality of <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> and internal cognitions because of their relativity. Buddha’s teachings lend support to the three valid cognizers which are the three consciousnesses that comprehend the manifest (visible phenomena), the slightly hidden phenomena or kimchid-paroksha (which can be inferred) and the very hidden phenomena or atyartha-paroksha (which is known through the power of belief).|$|R

25|$|In Kashmir Shaivism, Supreme Consciousness (Cit, {{identical}} to Akula) {{is considered to}} be the substrate of manifestation. Consciousness is the ultimate principle, the monad of the universe, always present as substrate in every <b>external</b> <b>object,</b> be it gross (physical), subtle (mental) or subtlest (relating to the causal body or soul). Thus external world, body, mind and soul are considered kindred parts of the whole, concretisation of the supreme consciousness. From this perspective, Kula is the totality of manifestation, in gross, subtle and supreme form. Even if Cit is not directly involved in the process of manifestation (as it is said to be unmanifest), it is always present in every possible facet of manifestation.|$|E

500|$|Consciousness is {{the state}} or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> or {{something}} within oneself.

500|$|For the Stoics, {{truth is}} {{distinguished}} from error by the sage who possesses right reason. Chrysippus's theory of knowledge was empirical. The senses transmit {{messages from the}} external world, and their reports are controlled not by referring them to innate ideas, but by comparing them to previous reports stored in the mind. Zeno had defined impressions of sense as [...] "an impression in the soul" [...] and this was interpreted literally by Cleanthes, who compared the impression on the soul to the impression made by a seal on wax. Chrysippus preferred to regard it as an alteration or change in the soul; that is, the soul receives a modification from every <b>external</b> <b>object</b> that acts upon it, just as the air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at once.|$|E
500|$|In {{the receipt}} of an {{impression}}, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its own existence, but that also of its cause—just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it. The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First must come the impression, and the understanding—having the power of utterance—expresses in speech the affection it receives from the object. True presentations are distinguished from those that are false {{by the use of}} memory, classification and comparison. If the sense organ and the mind are healthy—and provided that an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> can be really seen or heard—the presentation, due to its clearness and distinctness, has the power to [...] the [...] that always lies in our power, to give or to withhold. In a context in which people are understood to be [...] beings, reason is developed out of these notions.|$|E

2500|$|Consciousness is {{sometimes}} {{defined as the}} quality or state of being aware of an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> or something within oneself.

2500|$|In dependency, the {{essential}} {{aim of the}} group is to attain security through, and have its members protected by, one individual. The basic assumption in this group culture {{seems to be that}} an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> exists whose function it is to provide security for the immature individual. The group members behave passively, and act as though the leader, by contrast, is omnipotent and omniscient. For example, the leader may pose a question only to be greeted with docile silence, as though he or she had not spoken at all. The leader may be idealized into a kind of god who can take care of his or her children, and some especially ambitious leaders may be susceptible to this role. Resentment at being dependent may eventually lead the group members to [...] "take down" [...] the leader, and then search for a new leader to repeat the process.|$|E
2500|$|Schizoid {{individuals}} frequently act {{out with}} substance {{and alcohol abuse}} and other addictions which serve as substitutes for human relationships (see dual diagnosis). The substitute of a nonhuman for a human object serves as a schizoid defense. Providing examples of how the schizoid individual creates a personal relation with the drug, Seinfeld tells of an addict who called heroin his [...] "soothing white pet," [...] and of others who referred to crack as their [...] "bad mama" [...] or [...] "boyfriend." [...] He explains that [...] "Not all addicts name their drug, but there often is the trace of a personal feeling about the relationship." [...] The object relations view emphasizes that the drug use and alcoholism reinforce the fantasy of union with an internal object, yet enable the addict to be indifferent to the <b>external</b> <b>object</b> world. Addiction is therefore a schizoid and symbiotic defense.|$|E
2500|$|Yet it {{has been}} argued whether or not {{identification}} with the <b>external</b> <b>object</b> should still be the core of a correct approach to sensation, for there are many who state the definition thus because they regard the link with external reality as crucial. If sensations are defined as [...] "raw feels", there arises a palpable threat to the reliability of knowledge. The reason has been given that, if one sees them as neurophysiological happenings in the brain, it is difficult to understand how they could have any connection to entities, whether in the body or the external world. It has been declared, by John McDowell for example, that to countenance qualia as a [...] "bare presence" [...] prevents us ever gaining a certain ground for our knowledge. The issue is thus fundamentally an epistemological one: it would appear that access to knowledge is blocked if one allows the existence of qualia as fields in which only virtual constructs are before the mind.|$|E
50|$|Objection: Then {{why does}} {{everyone}} think that matter and an external world exist? Answer: People notice that some ideas appear {{in their minds}} independently of their wishes or desires. They then conclude that those ideas or perceived objects exist outside of the mind. This judgment, however, is a contradiction. Some philosophers, who know that ideas exist only in the mind, assume that there are <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> that resemble the ideas. They think that <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> cause internal, mental ideas.|$|R
50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of perception, critical realism is the theory {{that some of our}} sense-data (for example, those of primary qualities) can and do accurately represent <b>external</b> <b>objects,</b> properties, and events, while other of our sense-data (for example, those of secondary qualities and perceptual illusions) do not accurately represent any <b>external</b> <b>objects,</b> properties, and events. Put simply, critical realism highlights a mind-dependent aspect of the world that reaches to understand (and comes to an understanding of) the mind-independent world.|$|R
6000|$|... “When we {{turn our}} {{attention}} to <b>external</b> <b>objects,</b> and begin to exercise our rational faculties about them, we find {{that there are some}} motions and changes in them which we have power to produce, and that there are many which must have some other cause. Either the objects must have life and active power, as we have, or they must be moved or changed by something that has life and active power, as <b>external</b> <b>objects</b> are moved by us.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his book}} Sensing the World, Moreland Perkins argues that qualia {{need not be}} {{identified}} with their objective sources: a smell, for instance, bears no direct resemblance to the molecular shape that gives rise to it, nor is a toothache actually in the tooth. He is also like Hobbes {{in being able to}} view the process of sensing as being something complete in itself; as he puts it, it is not like [...] "kicking a football" [...] where an <b>external</b> <b>object</b> is required—it is more like [...] "kicking a kick", an explanation which entirely avoids the familiar Homunculus Objection, as adhered to, for example, by Gilbert Ryle. Ryle was quite unable even to entertain this possibility, protesting that [...] "in effect it explained the having of sensations as the not having of sensations." [...] However, A.J. Ayer in a rejoinder identified this objection as [...] "very weak" [...] as it betrayed an inability to detach the notion of eyes, indeed any sensory organ, from the neural sensory experience.|$|E
2500|$|E. J. Lowe, of Durham University, {{denies that}} holding to {{indirect}} realism (in {{which we have}} access only to sensory features internal to the brain) necessarily implies a Cartesian dualism. He agrees with Bertrand Russell that our [...] "retinal images"—that is, the distributions across our retinas—are connected to [...] "patterns of neural activity in the cortex" [...] (Lowe 1986). He defends {{a version of the}} Causal Theory of Perception in which a causal path can be traced between the <b>external</b> <b>object</b> and the perception of it. He is careful to deny that we do any inferring from the sensory field, a view which he believes allows us to found an access to knowledge on that causal connection. In a later work he moves closer to the non-epistemic theory in that he postulates [...] "a wholly non-conceptual component of perceptual experience", but he refrains from analyzing the relation between the perceptual and the [...] "non-conceptual". Most recently he has drawn attention to the problems that hallucination raises for the direct realist and to their disinclination to enter the discussion on the topic.|$|E
