25|$|An <b>{{electric}}ity</b> <b>meter,</b> electric meter, electrical meter, {{or energy}} meter is {{a device that}} measures the amount of electric energy consumed by a residence, a business, or an electrically powered device.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} unit of {{measurement}} on the <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> is the kilowatt hour , which {{is equal to the}} amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI megajoule instead.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{requirement}} for all UK <b>electricity</b> <b>meters</b> to undergo a health, safety and security inspection and meter reading every 2 years. <b>Electricity</b> <b>meters</b> {{need to be replaced}} every 10 to 30 years, depending on the model.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{deregulation}} of electricity supply markets {{in many countries}} (e.g., UK), the company responsible for an <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be {{the property of the}} meter Operator, electricity distributor, the retailer or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of an <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a utility pole serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises {{adjacent to the}} consumer unit / distribution board. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to vandalism.|$|E
25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC <b>electricity</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed at 11:00am, 18minutes after take-off, near Sutton Wick, [...] {{south of}} Abingdon. 50-year-old Muriel Binnington {{lived in the}} prefabricated house. Eyewitness Eric Webb said it was [...] "swept away", and {{she must have been}} killed instantly. A 19-year-old called J Maltravers from the Southern Electricity Board was in one of the houses to read the <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> and was also killed. The tail section of the aircraft crashed on a farmhouse near the main wreckage, trapping and seriously injuring Margaret Stanton in the kitchen of the house. She was later freed by emergency workers.|$|E
500|$|The church's main façade {{is located}} on its east side, facing toward Timber Ridge, {{and away from the}} Cacapon River and Christian Church Road. The east side {{consists}} of a front gable façade of white-painted clapboard siding. The church has one entryway, which is a centrally-located, four-paneled wooden door, topped by wooden dentil molding and a rectangular, four-light transom window. The transom is the only window on the church's east side. Unpainted wooden railings are {{on each side of the}} entryway. The clapboard siding on the church's east side is horizontal, and varies between [...] in width. The overhanging eave of the church's roof is accentuated by a single wooden drop pendant at the top of the gable. The modern <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> is located to the right of the main entrance. The non-loadbearing concrete block perimeter wall on this side is concealed by a stone veneer.|$|E
500|$|Common law conspiracies, on {{the other}} hand, fall into two categories; [...] "conspiracy to defraud" [...] and [...] "conspiracy to corrupt public morals". A third {{category}} which existed {{at the time of}} the 1977 Act, [...] "conspiracy to outrage public decency", has now become a statutory offence. Indeed, corrupting public morals may have become a statutory offence; the situation is unclear. The standard definition of a conspiracy to defraud was provided by Lord Dilhorne in Scott v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, when he said that [...] Conspiracy to defraud therefore contains two key elements; that the conspiracy involved dishonesty, and that if the conspiracy was undertaken, the victim's property rights would be harmed. This does not require the defendants' actions to directly result in the fraud; in R v Hollinshead, the House of Lords held that producing devices designed to alter <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> readings constituted conspiracy to defraud, even though the actual fraud would be carried out by members of the public rather than the conspirators. In two situations, it will not even be necessary for the actions to directly lead to any kind of financial loss for the victim; these are when the conspirators plan to deceive a person holding public office into acting counter to their duties, and when the conspirators know that their actions put the victim's property at risk, even if the risk never materialises. Conspiracy to [...] "corrupt public morals" [...] has no definitive case law; it is unknown whether or not it is a substantive offence, and Herring sees it as unlikely that conspirators will be prosecuted for this offence.|$|E

2500|$|For the United Kingdom, any {{installed}} <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> {{is required}} to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%. [...] Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. [...] The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory. [...] Approximately 93% of disputed meters {{are found to be}} operating satisfactorily. [...] A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory are able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. [...] This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read {{for as long as the}} consumer has had a gas supply through it.|$|E
