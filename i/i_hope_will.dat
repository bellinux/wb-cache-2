As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

500|$|Between October 1798 and February 1799, Wordsworth {{worked on}} {{the first draft of}} the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{together}} with a number of other verses, including the [...] "Matthew poems", [...] "Lucy Gray" [...] and The Prelude. Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth's separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the [...] "Lucy poems": [...] "Strange fits", [...] "She dwelt", and [...] "A slumber". They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that [...] "She dwelt" [...] and [...] "Strange fits" [...] were [...] "little Rhyme poems which <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> amuse you". Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic The Recluse.|$|E

2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{arrived in}} England on 7 March 1874.

Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: [...] "I took dear Marie {{in my arms and}} kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ...

2500|$|With {{the filing}} {{deadline}} for candidates looming, Lawrence said in January that [...] "we have adopted this other formula - a makeshift redistricting - and that's {{what it will}} be - to hurtle this present situation of avoiding having an election of all 27 member of Congress at large. Subsequent legislatures, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>will</b> {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide early last year, without outside interference, we would have had a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every way that I can, but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide." [...] Morse, in turn, retorted: [...] "It would appear that responsibility for the delay is going to be placed exactly where it belongs - with the Republicans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{claimed that}} he found slavery bothersome and {{time-consuming}} as an everyday institution to run. In an 1856 letter to his wife he maintained that slavery was a great evil, but primarily due to adverse impact that it had on white people:In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>will</b> prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.After {{the end of the}} Civil War, it was often claimed that Lee was in some sense opposed to slavery. In the generation following the war, Lee, though he died just a few years later, became a central figure in the Lost Cause interpretation of the war. The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation. Douglas Southall Freeman's Pulitzer prize-winning four-volume R. E. [...] Lee: A Biography (1936), which was for a long period considered the definite work on Lee, downplayed his involvement in slavery and emphasized Lee as a virtuous person. Eric Foner, who describes Freeman's volume as a [...] "", notes that on the whole, Freeman [...] "displayed little interest in Lee’s relationship to slavery. The index to his four volumes contained 22 entries for 'devotion to duty', 19 for 'kindness', 53 for Lee's celebrated horse, Traveller. But 'slavery', 'slave emancipation' and 'slave insurrection' together received five. Freeman observed, without offering details, that slavery in Virginia represented the system 'at its best'. He ignored the postwar testimony of Lee’s former slave Wesley Norris about the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected." ...|$|E
