To understand the extend of NAT usage and its impli-cations, we explore NAT usage in residential broadband networks based on ob-servations from more than 20, 000 <b>DSL</b> <b>lines.</b> We present a unique approach for detecting the presence of NAT and for estimating the number of hosts connected behind a NAT gateway using IP TTLs and HTTP user-agent strings. Furthermore, we study when each of the multiple hosts behind a single NAT gateway is active. This enables us to detect simultaneous use. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy of NAT analysis techniques when fewer information is available. We find that more than 90 % of <b>DSL</b> <b>lines</b> use NAT gateways to connect to the Internet and that 10 % of <b>DSL</b> <b>lines</b> have multiple hosts that are active at the same time. Overall, up to 52 % of lines have multiple hosts. Our findings point out that using IPs as host identifiers may introduce substantial errors and therefore should be used with caution. ...|$|R

40|$|Broadband Access Networks are {{composed}} {{of a wide variety}} of access technologies and transport protocols hindering end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. Protocol diversity could be overcome by defining appropriate internetworking protocols, but access technology diversity is more difficult to tackle. This problem could be mitigated by obtaining diagnostic information of each specific access technology in order to react upon events on each access link. Moreover, centralizing this information into an automated Operational Support System (OSS) would ease the management of the access network resources. Thereby, an appropriate framework for QoS control could be created. This paper presents a novel method to enable end-to-end QoS in Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) based access networks by integrating the <b>DSL</b> <b>line</b> information from the monitoring and diagnostic tools together with the resource management function of an automated OSS. With such a network architecture global end-to-end QoS can be established to support critical services like Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and Voice over IP (VoIP). 1...|$|E

This paper focuses on the performance gains of SC-IWF. This method is an autonomous DSM method (DSM level 1) and it will be investigated together with two other DSM level- 1 algorithms, under various noise conditions, namely, iterative water-filling algorithm, and flat power back-off (flat PBO).|$|R

40|$|Teleprotection {{for power}} systems is safety-critical and has {{demanding}} requirements for bandwidth, low latency, and low jitter. Traditionally, time-division multiplexing (TDM) using SONET/SDH circuits {{has been used}} to provide this quality of service. Modern packet-based networks offer several advantages, such as improved flexibility and greater bandwidth efficiency. With IP/MPLS, packet-based networks can cater for teleprotection functionality. This report demonstrates the potential for commercially-available IP/MPLS hardware to provide teleprotection functionality over two DSL technologies, VDSL and SHDSL. A real-time hardware in the loop environment has been developed to test these schemes under a variety of scenarios, which are indicative of real-world conditions. Commercially-available protection relays were used to implement C 37. 94 -based communications, and the stability of the protection functions were monitored closely during the testing. The results highlight the maximum <b>DSL</b> <b>line</b> distance and the remaining bandwidth (after provisioning for the teleprotection) which can be achieved, whilst observing a 6 ms propagation delay restriction. VDSL is only suitable for links up to approximately 1. 4 km, although it can deliver relatively high bandwidth of 4 - 19 Mbps, depending on the line distance. SHDSL can support up to 4 - 5 km per span. Distances of approximately 4. 3 km offer a good compromise of distance, delay, and remaining bandwidth. Using two serially-connected SHDSL spans is beneficial: it can support either longer distances, or provide greater spare bandwidth. The number of C 37. 94 slots used for teleprotection should be greater than 4, where possible, to help reduce the propagation delay. Each DSL modem type “favours” particular MPLS payload sizes, and these values provide the best compromises in connection distance, delay, and remaining bandwidth – as well as ensuring that the protection scheme remains stable...|$|E
40|$|Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs) {{have gained}} {{importance}} {{over the last}} years as services such as high-definition television (HDTV), three-dimensional television (3 DTV), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), video streaming and interactive video applications, which pose high requirements on data rates, latency and line stability, have become part of our every day life. The constantly increasing number of DSL users and trying to match the growing bandwidth demand by using high frequencies have made far-end crosstalk (FEXT) between copper wires the dominant impairment in current DSL systems. The noise perceived on a <b>DSL</b> <b>line</b> is comprised of noises from several sources, but the largest and most dominant noise on DSL lines is the summation of FEXT from all other active lines in the bundle. The number of active lines is strongly daytime dependent and consequently, the distribution of noise on DSL lines is not stationary. Furthermore, FEXT fluctuates when DSL users change their operational state. This work investigates low-complex and practical approaches for the protection against time-varying noise in DSL systems. In order to be in compliance with current DSL systems, in this work, the DSL modems operate independently without any coordination with other lines. Furthermore, the same transmit spectra are assumed for all the modems, and only receiver-based approaches are considered. One approach to protect against time-varying non-stationary noise is to set the target bit rate such that it can still be achieved at times with peak noise levels. Traditionally, a fixed signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) margin is subtracted from the measured SNR during initialization when calculating the target data rate. In practical DSL systems, the value of the SNR margin is set ad-hoc to 6 dB and is independent of the SNR at initialization and of the noise distribution, and therefore, {{the state of the art}} SNR margin is not optimal in terms of data rate and outage probability. To improve the protection against time-varying noise and increase link stability, the concept of Virtual Noise (VN) has been introduced. In this work, we jointly optimize the VN mask and the SNR margin in order to maximize the target data rate while satisfying a target outage probability defined over 24 hours. Another problem with the state of the art SNR margin is that it is tone-independent. In practical DSL systems, the received noise might increase only at some tones such that the per-tone SNR margins of the affected tones become negative. To prevent re-initializations in such cases, modems have the ability to equalize the SNR margin across tones by adapting their bit-loading to slowly changing SNR by using bit-swapping. However, bit-swapping might be too slow to move bits from the affected tones such that non-negative per tone margins are restored and the connection is interrupted. In this work we solve this problem by adjusting the VN mask and SNR margin such that in addition to achieving the maximum target data rate while satisfying a target outage probability, the probability of the line going to a state with negative per-tone SNR margins is reduced. The VN mask and the SNR margin are expressed as functions of the target outage probability and the distributions of the maximum noise power measured over 24 hours at each tone. Comparison with state of the art approaches reveals that the proposed approach improves the data rate and outage probability performance. Another approach to protect against time-varying non-stationary noise is to adapt the target data rate to the varying noise. The concept of Seamless Rate Adaptation (SRA) was introduced to seamlessly adapt the data rate of a connection to the changing SNR while in operation without any service interruption. Interleavers used in transmission for the protection against burst errors impose a constraint on how much the data rate that can be changed by an SRA procedure. Moreover, to keep an equal error probability over all tones, it is very likely that the bit-loadings of all tones have to be modified in each SRA procedure. Hence, the state of the art SRA is too slow and provides means of adaptation only to slowly changing SNRs and will not prevent reinitializations under certain conditions such as large rapid changes in FEXT. In this work, two adaptation approaches are proposed. In the case where multiple adaptation procedures are required to modify the bit-loadings of the tones to the target bit-loadings that correspond to the new SNR, both approaches satisfy the data rate constraint imposed by interleavers. Furthermore, both approaches equalize the error probability over all tones only after the last procedure when the target bit-loadings is achieved at all tones. The first approach modifies the tones to their target bit-loadings in the order that leads to the fastest decrease in the average bit error rate (BER). The second one modifies the bit-loadings of the tones in groups and finds the per group constant bit reductions that decrease the average BER as rapidly as possible. Moreover, low complex versions of the proposed approaches are presented such that they can be used in practice by DSL modems with limited computational power. Performance results reveal that all the proposed approaches shorten the adaptation time tremendously and decrease the number of errors that occur during the adaptation when compared to the state of the art SRA. DSL users often use services with different requirements on quality of service in terms of outage probability. In such cases, we propose in this work a hybrid VN-SRA approach that iteratively allocates tones to be used by the proposed approach where the VN mask and the SNR margin are jointly optimized for services that require a BER that is smaller than or equal to the target BER with an outage probability that is smaller than or equal to the target outage probability. Moreover, the hybrid VN-SRA approach allocates tones to be used by the proposed adaptive data rate approaches for services that can tolerate temporary increases in the BER above the the target BER during the adaptation to the varying noise. Performance results reveal data rate gains when compared to the case where the data rate achieved over all tones is guaranteed at a BER that is smaller than or equal to the target BER with an outage probability that is smaller than or equal to the target outage probability. The approaches presented in this work can improve the performance of today's DSL systems. Furthermore, the implementation of those approaches requires only minimal changes of the current DSL standard...|$|E
