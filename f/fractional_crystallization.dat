This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate.

5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications {{and the lack}} of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year.

The <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization</b> of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum.

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} age of the universe of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization,</b> Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
40|$|Actually {{this account}} {{is the story}} of the genesis of an invention[1]. The inven-tative process is not clearly understood, but one factor that seems to be im-portant is to have a heavy {{infusion}} of naivety. That is why so frequently it is not the experts that do the inventing, but they are the ones who, that once the lead is established, come in and exploit the area. Our work is an excellent illustration of this phenomenon. In the study of any of the life sciences, chiral compounds are important. In the past when chiral compounds were needed, chemists have had to use bio-chemical processes or make racemic mixtures followed by laborious resolu-tions. In industry the problem is particularly severe since resolution with its numerous recycle loops and <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallizations,</b> is an inherently ex-pensive process. Thus, large volume products like monosodium L-glutamate, L-lysine and L-menthol have been made traditionally by biochemical routes even though efficient procedures are available to make their racemic forms.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization.</b> As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization</b> of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to explore the use of <b>fractional</b> {{evaporative}} <b>crystallization</b> as a technology {{that can be used}} to separate medium-curie waste from the Hanford Site tank farms into a high-curie waste stream, which can be sent to a Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP), and a low-curie waste stream, which can be sent to Bulk Vitrification. Experimental semi-batch crystallizations of sodium salts from simulant solutions of double-shell tank (DST) feed demonstrated that the recovered crystalline product met the purity requirement for exclusion of cesium and nearly met the requirement on sodium recovery. Batch <b>fractional</b> evaporative <b>crystallization</b> involves the removal of multiple solutes from a feed solution by the progressive achievement of supersaturation (through evaporation) and concomitant nucleation and growth of each species. The slurry collected from each of these crystallization stages was collected and introduced to filtration and washing steps. The product crystals obtained after washing were sampled for analysis by polarized light microscopy (PLM), dried, and sieved. The PLM results aided in identification of species crystallized in each stage. Carbonation was used as a supplemental method to evaporative crystallization in order to increase the sodium recovery in DST experiments. Carbonation was necessary due to the high aluminum ion concentration in the solution, which leads to formation of a viscous gel during evaporation. This gel was avoided by reacting carbon dioxide with hydroxyl ions, which modified the system behavior. Through two stages of carbonation, each followed by evaporation, the effect of carbonation on sodium recovery was demonstrated. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. Ronald W.

40|$|A new {{crystalline}} protein, chymo-trypsinogen, {{has been}} isolated from acid extracts of fresh cattle pancreas. This protein {{is not an}} enzyme but is transformed by minute amounts of trypsin into an active proteolytic enzyme called chymo-trypsin. The chymo-trypsin has also been obtained in crystalline form. The chymo-trypsinogen cannot be activated by enterokinase, pepsin, inactive trypsin, or calcium chloride. There is an extremely slow spontaneous activation upon standing in solution. The activation of chymo-trypsinogen by trypsin follows {{the course of a}} monomolecular reaction the velocity constant of which is proportional to the trypsin concentration and independent of the chymotrypsinogen concentration. The rate of activation is a maximum at pH 7. 0 – 8. 0. Activation is accompanied by an increase of six primary amino groups per mole but no split products could be found, indicating that the activation consists in an intramolecular rearrangement. There is a slight change in optical activity but no change in molecular weight. The physical and chemical properties of both proteins are constant through a series of <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallizations.</b> The activity of chymo-trypsin decreases in proportion to the destruction of the native protein by pepsin digestion or denaturation by heat or acid. Chymo-trypsin has powerful milk-clotting power but does not clot blood plasma and differs qualitatively in this respect from the crystalline trypsin previously reported. It hydrolyzes sturin, casein, gelatin, and hemoglobin more slowly than does crystalline trypsin but the hydrolysis of casein is carried much further. The hydrolysis takes place at different linkages from those attacked by trypsin. The optimum pH for the digestion of casein is about 8. 0 – 9. 0.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether basaltic rocks in continental flood basalt provinces are primary magmas or whether they are descended in general from picritic parent magmas is reviewed. It is suggested that the latter {{is more likely to}} be correct on the evidence of phase relations and the relative rareness of mantle materials with appropriate Fe/Mg ratios. Major element variations in the residual liquids of <b>fractional</b> and equilibrium <b>crystallization</b> of basaltic magmas are modelled for a variety of crystallizing assemblages. It is concluded that crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase has a marked effect on buffering chemical change in many important elements. It is this effect which accounts for the apparent uniformity of large volumes of flood basalts, not, as has sometimes been supposed, a series of implausible coincidences in the amount of material fractionated from each magma batch. It is further argued that much of the variation seen in basalts may be imposed by polybaric fractionation operating throughout crustal depths, that is at pressures up to at least 12 kb. Parental picritic magmas rising from the mantle reach the surface in exceptional areas of crustal thinning. More usually, however, it is suggested that they intrude the base of the crust as a series of sills which differentiate into upper gabbroic and lower ultramafic portions. Much of the 'low pressure' fractionation of basaltic magmas may take place in this deep crustal sill complex and evolved liquids are transmitted to the surface as their density becomes sufficiently low. This implies that in areas of flood vulcanism a potentially large new contribution to the crust is made by under-plating, the volumes of concealed cumulates being at least as large as the amount of erupted surface lava...|$|R
40|$|The Morrison deposit, {{located at}} the Levack mine in the City of Greater Sudbury, is a footwall-type Cu-Ni-platinum-group-element (PGE) deposit hosted within a zone of Sudbury Breccia in the Archean Levack Gneiss Complex beneath the North Range of the Sudbury Igneous Complex. It {{consists}} of sharp-walled, sulfide-rich veins that are enriched in Cu-Pt-Pd-Au relative to contact-type mineralization and can be subdivided based on vein geochemistry, mineralogy, texture, and morphology into a pyrrhotite-rich upper domain, a chalcopyrite-rich lower domain, and a pyrrhotite equal to chalcopyrite middle domain. All domains contain steeply to vertically dipping first-order sulfide veins, irregular and discontinuous second-order sulfide veins, and disseminated sulfides in country rocks. First- and second-order veins can be further subdivided into inclusion-free veins typically within Sudbury breccia matrix or along clast-matrix boundaries, and very irregular and inclusion-rich veins associated with leucosomes in mafic gneiss clasts and granophyric-textured dikes. First-order veins consist of pyrrhotite > chalcopyrite = pentlandite > magnetite in the upper domain, pyrrhotite = chalcopyrite > pentlandite > cubanite > magnetite in the middle domain, and chalcopyrite >> pentlandite > pyrrhotite = cubanite > magnetite in the lower domain. Second-order veins consist of pyrrhotite = chalcopyrite > pentlandite > magnetite and chalcopyrite = millerite = pentlandite in the middle domain, and chalcopyrite >> millerite, millerite > chalcopyrite, bornite >> chalcopyrite, and millerite > bornite > chalcopyrite in the lower domain. Second order veins are adjacent to and in contact with epidote, amphibole, chlorite, carbonate, quartz, and magnetite alteration minerals. Sulfide mineralization in the Morrison deposit is similar to other footwall mineralization associated with the SIC. The veins {{appear to have been}} emplaced preferentially into zones of Sudbury Breccia that were within ~ 400 m of the basal contact of the SIC, because that lithology is more permeable and because those zones are within the thermal aureole of the cooling SIC permitting penetration of sulfide melts. The mineralogical, textural, and geochemical zoning in the chalcopyrite-pentlandite-pyrrhotite-rich parts of the Morrison deposit are best explained by partial <b>fractional</b> and/or equilibrium <b>crystallization</b> of MSS and ISS. Bornite ± millerite-rich mineralization are interpreted to have formed by reaction of residual sulfide melts with wall rocks, consuming Fe and S to form actinolitemagnetite- epidote-chlorite-sulfide reaction zones and driving the sulfide melt across the thermal divide {{in that part of the}} Fe-Cu-Ni-S system to crystallize borniteSS ± milleriteSS. Gold-Pt-Pd appear to have been more mobile than other metals, forming localized zones of enrichment, although it is not clear yet whether they were mobile as Au-Pt-Pd-Bi-Te-Sb-rich melts or aqueous fluids.

40|$|Salts are {{widespread}} in the cold, arid McMurdo region of Antarctica. They exist {{in a variety of}} deposit types from massive subglacial and sub-lake deposits containing up to 1010 kilograms of salt, down to traces in soil, snow and ice. However, deposits on rock and soil typically amount to a few grams of salt. At least 30 salt phases are known but only 10 of these are widespread. These 10 are thenardite, gypsum, halite, calcite, darapskite, soda nitre, mirabilite, bloedite, epsomite and hexahydrite. The distribution of salts has been examined on two scales, local and regional. The local scale extends from individual deposits to areas of a few square kilometres. The regional scale covers McMurdo oasis, McMurdo Sound and Ross Island, though areas in McMurdo oasis, and particularly Taylor Valley receive most attention. Local distribution is controlled by salt migration and separation. Migration is induced by water and wind, with soil brines moving as thin liquid films, by capillarity and under the influence of gravity. Deflation and asymmetric salt accumulation provide evidence that wind is important. Separation of phases is a consequence of different physico-chemical properties of salts, and environmental conditions, including site aspect, ambient temperature and humidity. Eutectic temperature is a fundamental salt property but solubility is also important. Several salt deposits containing separated (fractionated) phases have been found in the region. Separation is achieved mainly by <b>fractional</b> dissolution and <b>crystallization</b> and the most evolved product of the general separation sequence is calcium chloride. The separation processes, together with salt migration, obscure the sources of the salts. Regional distribution of salts has been characterized by determining the relative frequency at which specific phases are encountered at increasing distance from the coast and above sea level. Chloride and sodium phases decrease, whereas magnesium phases increase in frequency away from the coast. Sulphates-to-chloride and nitrates-to-chloride ratios increase with increasing distance. Calcium and carbonate show little change except in Taylor Valley where a marked decrease is apparent. This regional distribution is mainly dependent on the sources of the salts. The marine source is most important, contributing almost all of the chloride, sodium, sulphate and probably nitrate ions that are present. Chemical weathering is the predominant source of magnesium, calcium and carbonate ions probably via reactions of mafic, ferromagnesian minerals in local rocks and regolith. Biological and volcanic activity are locally significant at eastern Taylor Valley and in the summit area of Erebus Volcano, respectively. The salts have accumulated over the lifetime of the region, that is over less than the last 20 - 25 Ma or so. There is no evidence that they are relics from earlier, preglacial times, except for very minor amounts of gypsum and calcium carbonate. There has been a recent influx of sea water into Taylor Valley perhaps between 50, 000 and 20, 000 years ago, and evaporation of this water has preceded advance of Taylor Glacier over part of the resulting salt deposit. The continuing interaction between glacier and salt is causing basal ice to melt and producing aperiodic discharges of up to a few thousand cubic metres of salty water from the terminus of the glacier...|$|R

25|$|Magma {{composition}} can {{be determined}} by processes other than partial melting and <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization.</b> For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them.

25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (<b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization).</b> As minerals crystallize, {{the composition of}} the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallization</b> and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements.

40|$|On Stjernöy, Seiland and the {{neighbouring}} peninsulas of Öksfjord and Bergsfjord ultramafic bodies of peridotite and pyroxenite with associated layered gabbro sequences occur within {{a complex of}} highly metamorphic gabbro gneisses, rocks akin to pyroxene-granulites and mafic charnockites. As is shown on the basement map in insert of backflap the layered gabbro is generally concordant with the foliation of the surrounding gneisses but locally shows transgressive features. Within this mafic province occurrences of hornblendite, carbonatite, and nephelinesyenite are also found, the latter affiliation of rocks probably being the result of metasomatic processes. The petrography and general mineralogy of the ultramafic, gabbroic, and metamorphic types of rocks are described in detail. In the layered gabbro sequences on Stjernöy there exists no gravitational crystallization differentiation such as is found in other stratiform gabbro-peridotite complexes; the variation {{in the composition of}} the characteristic minerals is too small, and irregular at that. The textural relations point to incipient fracturing along grain-boundaries and, especially, to deuteric processes which can be inferred from the abundance of spinel-pyroxene symplectites. The characteristic rims of symplectite around olivine are clearly demonstrated in the photographs 2 and 3 on plate C. In texture and structure the gabbro gneisses and intercalated syenitic and meta-sedimentary rocks on Stjernöy exhibit considerable clastic and plastic deformation. Their mineral association points to an intense regional metamorphism near or within the granulite facies; by means of the ACF diagrams, fig. 9 a and 9 b, it is shown that the plotted mineral parageneses may be stable in the hornblendegranulite and the pyroxene-granulite subfacies. The investigation of co-existing clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine in the layered gabbro-peridotite sequence on Stjernöy indicates that high pressures and temperatures prevailed {{at the time of their}} formation. In tie-line trends of co-existing pyroxenes the layered gabbros from Stjernöy are remarkably similar, not to the normal type of stratiform gabbro-peridotite complexes, but to peridotite nodules in certain basaltic lavas. (compare fig. 5 a and 6 a). As is shown in fig. 6 b the tie-lines joining co-existing orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene from gabbro gneisses exhibit similar trends; these data most probably point to an extreme metamorphism of anhydrous rocks at great depth within the earth’s crust. The chemical analyses of samples of the ultramafic sequence, as plotted in the QLM diagram of fig. 8 a, exhibit a linear trend of differentiation; this suggests a simple process of <b>fractional</b> melting or <b>crystallization.</b> The projection points of the gabbro gneiss occupy a central position in this differentiation trend on Stjernöy; thus the gabbro gneiss provides a suitable material for such a process. High lime content is another chemical characteristic of gabbro and related ultramafic rocks on Stjernöy (fig. 8 b); hence the major femic mineral is a calcium-rich clinopyroxene, whereas magnesium-rich orthopyroxene predominates in the stratiform type of layered complex. Clearly, then, the layered gabbro and related ultramafite within the mafic province of western Finnmark differs considerably in major features from the wellknown layered gabbro-peridotite occurrences such as Bushveld, Stillwater or Skaergaard. Finally the results of the mineralogical and chemical investigations are discussed from the petrogenetic point of view. A hypothesis is offered for the emplacement of layered gabbro and ultramafite on Stjernöy involving differential anatexis with local palingenesis in a deepseated zone of the Caledonian orogen...|$|R
