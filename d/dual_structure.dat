5|$|The show {{is about}} {{the rise and fall}} of a relationship, juxtaposing a couple, Mark (Robert Bathurst) and Becky (Fiona Gillies), who meet and fall in love before getting {{separated}} and finally divorced. The show is semi-autobiographical; it was inspired by the then-recent separation of Moffat and his first wife. Some of the first series followed a non-linear <b>dual</b> <b>structure,</b> contrasting the rise of the relationship with the separation. Other episodes were ensemble farces, predominantly including the couple's friends Robert (Paul Raffield) and Tracy (Tracie Bennett). Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor, Becky's lover.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{assumes that}} systematic and systemic change are two components in instructional design (ID) [...] not dichotomous terms, but {{two sides of}} an interconnected <b>dual</b> <b>structured</b> system. Specifically, this paper examines the difference between systemic thinking and systematic thinking, the ideal mental model (<b>dual</b> <b>structured</b> systems) for ID, and the benefits from this mental model. The introductory section discusses {{the need for a}} <b>dual</b> <b>structured</b> instructional systems approach. An overview of the problems relating to systematic and systemic is then presented that covers the following topics: (1) dictionary definitions of the two terms; (2) different approaches of the two terms in the field of instructional systems design (ISD); (3) distinctions based on hard systems (typical tasks, step-by-step procedures) vs. soft systems (typical events, heuristic problems); (4) the conceptual model of <b>dual</b> <b>structured</b> instructional systems; (5) some guidelines for increasing systemic thinking, including the abilit...|$|R

500|$|Though the All-China Women's Federation {{is officially}} labeled an NGO, its longstanding {{relationship}} with the CPC means that the party still has interests in the federation and its members. [...] The four levels of the federation still coincide with the state administrative system. [...] The highest ranking body of the ACWF is the National Congress of Women which meets every five years. The National Congress Women studies reports sent to them from the Executive Committee of the ACWF, decide the goals for the women’s movements, make changes to the constitution, and elect the Executive Committee and Standing Committees of the ACWF. Under this national level, the provincial level’s women’s congresses meet every three years to select their Executive and Standing Committees. However the local level must also carry out the directive and report to the CPC committee in addition to following the ACWF. This is supposed to give the organization a <b>dual</b> <b>structure</b> of carrying out party orders and informing the government of women’s interests.|$|E

2500|$|On January 20, 1926, borough {{president}} Miller sent a {{plan for}} an $11 million elevated highway to be built completely on city property to the Board of Estimate. The elevated railroad {{was removed from the}} plan, since NYCRR had come up with a separate project for partially elevating and depressing their railroad (now known as the High Line). According to Miller, there were questions over who would own and maintain the <b>dual</b> <b>structure.</b> There were also objections to its height of 40 feet (12 m) and its placement at the east building line of the existing surface roads. The elevated highway was to connect to a planned parkway (now the Henry Hudson Parkway) at 72nd Street, forming a highway free from cross traffic stretching from Canal Street to 129th Street. The elevated road was to be 60 feet (18 m) wide, wide enough for six lanes of traffic; the existing surface road would carry local traffic beneath the highway. Ramps would be provided at Canal Street, Christopher Street, 14th Street, 23rd Street, 34th Street, 42nd Street, and 57th Street. Slow-moving traffic would use the left lanes, due to the left-hand ramps. This contrasts with the current method of using the left lane for passing and putting ramps on the right side, and to the method popular around the 1950s of putting ramps on whichever side was easier. The highway would [...] "carry buses that will make both its conveniences and its beauties available to the general public", according to Miller. He suggested Hudson River Boulevard for the name of the highway.|$|E
