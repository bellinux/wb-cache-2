500|$|In the United States, {{calls for}} the books to be banned from schools have led to legal {{challenges}} often {{on the grounds that}} witchcraft is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the books to be held in public schools violates {{the separation of church and}} state. The Orthodox churches of Greece and Bulgaria have also campaigned against the series, and some Catholic writers and officials have voiced a critical stance. The books have been banned <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>schools</b> in the United Arab Emirates and criticised in the Iranian state-run press. Religious responses to Harry Potter have not all been negative. [...] "At least as much as they've been attacked from a theological point of view," [...] notes Rowling, [...] " [...] have been lauded and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, it's been by several different faiths." ...|$|E
500|$|The manga's content {{has been}} {{controversial}} in the United States. In November 1999, Toys [...] "R" [...] Us removed Viz's Dragon Ball from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had [...] "borderline soft porn" [...] after he bought them for his four-year-old son. Commenting on the issue, manga critic Susan J. Napier determined the ban as {{a difference in}} culture due to Japan having tolerance for sexuality in manga while other countries not feeling the same way. After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series in 2000 to maintain its wide distribution. Viz made some [...] "concessions" [...] as well, and assured readers that all changes were approved by Toriyama and Shueisha. Toriyama made suggestions himself such as obscuring Goku's genitals with objects, rather than [...] "neuter him". A fan petition was created, garnering over 10,000 signatures, and a year later, Viz announced they would stop censoring Dragon Ball and increased its [...] "age rating" [...] to 13 and up instead, reprinting the first three graphic novels. However, they continued to censor several characters' lips by shading them in completely. This avoided racist stereotypes, {{such as that of}} Mr. Popo's image. In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it [...] "depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children". Esther Keller, Robin Brenner and Eva Volin of School Library Journal had no opinion whether or not removing [...] the manga <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>schools</b> in that district was right. However, Brenner and Volin criticize the parents who had a problem with the manga for going to a county council member who is involved with politics instead of to the librarian of the school that carries the manga.|$|E
