5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

25|$|A {{manifolded}} {{twin set}} with <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, but not when it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set in quite a short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not fail safe. If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{the left}} side {{manifold}} connection leak, the diver closes the isolating valve switches to the secondary regulator to use {{as much of the}} gas in the left cylinder as practicable before it runs out, then switches back to the primary regulator.

25|$|The two first stages {{are mounted}} on {{independently}} closable valves, {{as a first}} stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by shutting off the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out. The second regulator is there to supply the remaining gas when the first regulator is shut off. A second-stage <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> {{used in conjunction with}} a first-stage overpressure relief valve may be effective as a quick method to manage demand valve free-flow.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC 54-57) or {{some other}} design basis {{provides}} the basic design criteria for isolation of lines penetrating the containment wall. Each large pipe penetrating the containment, such as the steam lines, has <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> on it, configured as allowed by Appendix A; generally two valves. [...] For smaller lines, one {{on the inside and}} one on the outside. For large, high-pressure lines, space for relief valves and maintenance considerations cause the designers to install the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> near to where the lines exit containment. In the event of a leak in the high-pressure piping that carries the reactor coolant, these valves rapidly close to prevent radioactivity from escaping the containment. Valves on lines for standby systems penetrating containment are normally closed. [...] The containment <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> may also close on a variety of other signals such as the containment high pressure experienced during a high-energy line break (e.g. main steam or feedwater lines).
