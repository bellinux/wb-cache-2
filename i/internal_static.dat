These properties {{are necessary for}} the design of equipments for harvesting, processing, transporting, estimating loads in storage structures for crops and flow problems in silos such as arching, ratholing, irregular flow and segregation.

A very small NQR frequency is obtained with the observation of the spectrum, which shows an extremely wide continuous distribution of it that becomes significant narrower below 20 K at H ∥ c where the superconductivity is completely suppressed, indicating {{a significant change in}} the charge distribution at the Cu site, while the corresponding changes at H c is negligible when the superconductivity is present or not fully suppressed. The Knight shift and central linewidth are proportional to the applied magnetic field with a high anisotropy. We find that the magnitude of the <b>internal</b> <b>static</b> magnetic field at the copper is dominated by the anisotropic Cu^ 2 + 3 d-orbital contributions, while its weak temperature-dependence is mainly determined by the isotropic contact hyperfine coupling to the paramagnetic Pr^ 3 + spins, which also gives rise to the full distribution of the <b>internal</b> <b>static</b> magnetic field at the copper for H c.

The internal resonant modes have recently been studied by the authors; this letter investigates the static loop modes. Like <b>internal</b> resonant modes, <b>static</b> loop modes, in theory, should not be observed in the MOT solution since they do not satisfy the zero initial conditions; their appearance is attributed to numerical errors. It is discussed in this letter that the dependence of spurious static loop modes on numerical errors is substantially {{different from that of}} spurious internal resonant modes. More specifically, when Rao-Wilton-Glisson functions and Lagrange interpolation functions are used as spatial and temporal basis functions, respectively, errors due to space-time discretization have no discernible impact on spurious static loop modes. Numerical experiments indeed support this discussion and demonstrate that the numerical errors due to the approximate solution of the MOT matrix system have dominant impact on spurious static loop modes in the MOT solution. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
