50|$|The chief {{advantages}} of the horizontal sundial are that {{it is easy to}} read, and the sun lights the face throughout the year. All the hour-lines intersect {{at the point where the}} gnomon's style crosses the horizontal plane. Since the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the style points true North and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial's geographical latitude L. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude. For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40° can be used at a latitude of 45°, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5°, thus aligning the style with the Earth's rotational axis. Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the hourlines and so can never be corrected. A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal <b>hour</b> <b>angles.</b> To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Since the <b>hour</b> <b>angles</b> are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These types of dials usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by.Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas.|$|R

40|$|International audienceContext. The {{extended}} {{environment of}} galaxies contains {{a wealth of}} information about the formation and life cycle of galaxies which are regulated by accretion and feedback processes. Observations of neutral hydrogen are routinely used to image the high brightness disks of galaxies and to study their kinematics. Deeper observations will give more insight into the distribution of diffuse gas in the extended halo of the galaxies and the inter-galactic medium, where numerical simulations predict a cosmic web of extended structures and gaseous filaments. Aims. To observe the extended environment of galaxies, column density sensitivities have to be achieved that probe the regime of Lyman limit systems. HI observations are typically limited to a brightness sensitivity of N(HI) similar to 10 (19) cm(- 2), but this must be improved upon by similar to 2 orders of magnitude. Methods. In this paper we present the interferometric data of the Westerbork Virgo HI Filament Survey (WVFS) - the total power product of this survey has been published in an earlier paper. By observing at extreme <b>hour</b> <b>angles,</b> a filled aperture is simulated of 300 x 25 m in size, that has the typical collecting power and sensitivity of a single dish telescope, but the well defined bandpass characteristics of an interferometer. With the very good surface brightness sensitivity of the data, we hope to make new HI detections of diffuse systems with moderate angular resolution. Results. The survey maps 135 degrees in Right Ascension between 8 and 17 h and 11 degrees in Declination between - 1 and 10 degrees, including the galaxy filament connecting the Local Group with the Virgo Cluster. Only positive declinations could be completely processed and analysed due to projection effects. A typical flux sensitivity of 6 mJy beam(- 1) over 16 km s(- 1) is achieved, that corresponds to a brightness sensitivity of N(HI) similar to 10 (18) cm(- 2). An unbiased search has been done with a high significance threshold as well a search with a lower significance limit but requiring an optical counterpart. In total, 199 objects have been detected, of which 17 are new HI detections. Conclusions. By observing at extreme <b>hour</b> <b>angles</b> with the WSRT, a filled aperture can be simulated in projection, with a very good brightness sensitivity, comparable to that of a single dish telescope.
