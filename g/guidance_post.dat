Traditionally, {{there has been}} little <b>guidance</b> for <b>post</b> construction management of these sites. Post-construction management has largely been left to the discretion of the permit holder. There were no methods in place to effectively determine when regulatory requirements were achieved, or a standard to certify that the site was considered complete. Over the last decade, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has developed standardized mechanisms and processes for site management, reporting, and closeout procedures. These include establishment of site management crews, predictable funding sources for management activities, monitoring and reporting methods, and inter-disciplinary adaptive management teams that develop strategies for short and long-term site management. Recently, WSDOT partnered with local U. S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to develop a process for closing out mitigation sites with fulfilled permit requirements. These process improvements provide predictability for our mitigation efforts and long-term budget requirements to support site management activities. They also increase our credibility with the resource agencies by demonstrating the effectiveness of our adaptive management.

50|$|In September 1920, under Praeger′s <b>guidance,</b> the <b>Post</b> Office Department {{established}} the first transcontinental {{air mail route}} in the United States. However, the United States lacked a system of lighted navigation beacons, making it too dangerous for air mail pilots to fly at night, and trains carried the mail along the route during the hours of darkness. As a result, transcontinental air mail was not much faster - and considerably more expensive - than transcontinental mail service entirely by train. Praeger understood the dangers of night flying, but wanted to demonstrate its feasibility before President Warren G. Harding took office and appointed his successor. He therefore staged a set of experimental day-and-night mail flights between New York City and San Francisco, California - two eastbound and two westbound - in February 1921.. Not a pilot and, as a native of Texas, unfamiliar with winter weather in the northern and western United States, Praeger probably did not fully understand the danger the flights posed to his pilots. The two westbound flights become stranded in Dubois, Pennsylvania, and Chicago, Ilinois. The first eastbound flight ended in tragedy when the de Havilland DH-4B carrying the mail stalled and crashed after takeoff from Elko, Nevada. The only real success was by the second eastbound flight, whose pilot managed to fly a night leg from North Platte, Nebraska, to Chicago.|$|R

40|$|Background: There are {{potential}} conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially {{where there are}} effectiveness, safety and/ or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant {{for the prevention of}} stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies showed dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. These concerns resulted in extensive activities pre- to post-launch to manage its introduction. Objective: To (i) review authority activities across countries, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications based on post-launch activities. Methodology: (i) Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran, (ii) development of guidance for key stakeholder groups through an iterative process, (iii) refining <b>guidance</b> following <b>post</b> launch studies. Results: Plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, centring on three pillars of pre-, peri- and post-launch activities. Post-launch activities include increasing use of patient registries to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in clinical practice. Conclusion: Models for introducing new drugs are essential to optimise their prescribing especially where concerns. Without such models, new drugs may be withdrawn prematurely and/ or struggle for funding...|$|R

These post war efforts in the country reveal a unique approach of contemporary conflict prevention enterprise {{in the context of the}} way the government conducts its post war activities. The emergence of the victors’ peace situation poses question towards the conflict prevention paradigm, which does not give any clear guidance to prevent relapse and establish sustainable and positive peace in such a context where the victors lacks a political will to address the root causes of conflict through political reform and to use the conflict prevention process as a medium of building trust. The purpose of the research is to see how conflict prevention has been carried out in post war Sri Lanka and examine whether it is effective to establish sustainable peace and prevent relapse of conflict or not. The research is based on the case study of the various conflict prevention efforts taken by different actors. The study is conducted as a comparative study of theory and case to simplify the research and draw conclusions which can question or support some of the existing practical efforts in Sri Lanka in particular and theoretical approach in general.
