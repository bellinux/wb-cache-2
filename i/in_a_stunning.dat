5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The First Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That {{first race}} began in Evanston and {{finished}} {{in front of}} a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park race track. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E
5|$|When the President of the Massachusetts Senate, William M. Bulger, {{announced}} his resignation from his 1st Suffolk seat in late 1995, Lynch filed nomination papers {{for the special}} election to replace him. Bulger's son, attorney William M. Bulger, Jr. ran for the seat. Another lawyer, Patrick Loftus, also ran for the Democratic primary. The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> victory, Lynch won the Democratic primary in March 1996, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56–35–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96–4% and was inaugurated on May 1, 1996. He won re-election unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.|$|E

5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E
5|$|This {{invasion}} {{brought on}} the last great sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Its plan for the Battle of Leyte Gulf included a feint by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through San Bernardino Strait. At {{the opening of the}} battle planes from the carriers guarded by New Jersey struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while New Jersey steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been turned back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> defeat when she arrived.|$|E

25|$|The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud {{brought his}} party to {{power for the}} first time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> {{election}} victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.|$|E
25|$|After {{this series}} of {{imperial}} advances, on 5 November a Prussian corps under Frederick engaged Soubise's much larger force {{near the village of}} Rossbach in Saxony. The ensuing Battle of Rossbach ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> Prussian victory, in which Frederick lost fewer than 1,000 men, while the Franco-German force under Soubise lost around 10,000. This victory secured Prussia's control of Saxony for the time, and its effect on the morale of both sides was dramatic. After the embarrassing defeat at Rossbach, French interest in the Silesian War declined sharply; with the signing of Third Treaty of Versailles in March 1758, France greatly reduced its financial and military contributions to the Austrian coalition, leaving Rossbach as the only battle between the French and Prussians during the entire war.|$|E
25|$|When Israel {{was founded}} in 1948, the {{majority}} Labor leadership, which governed for three decades after independence, accepted the partition of the previous British Mandate of Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states as a pragmatic solution to the political and demographic issues of the territory, with the description Land of Israel applying to {{the territory of the}} State of Israel within the Green Line. The then opposition revisionists, who evolved into today's Likud party, however, regarded the rightful Land of Israel as Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema (literally, the whole Land of Israel), which came to be referred to as Greater Israel. Joel Greenberg, writing in The New York Times relates subsequent events this way:The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought his party to power for the first time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> election victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

25|$|The Battle of Gettysburg {{is often}} {{considered}} the war's turning point. Meade defeated Lee in a three-day battle fought by 160,000 soldiers, with 51,000 casualties. It {{started as a}} meeting engagement {{on the morning of}} July 1, when brigades from Henry Heth's division clashed with Buford's cavalry, and then John F. Reynolds's I Corps. As the Union XI Corps arrived, they and the I Corps were smashed by Ewell's and Hill's corps arriving from the north and forced back through the town, taking up defensive positions on high ground south of town. On July 2, Lee launched a massive pair of assaults against the left and right flanks of Meade's army. Fierce battles raged at Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, East Cemetery Hill, and Culp's Hill. Meade was able to shift his defenders along interior lines, and they repulsed the Confederate advances. On July 3, Lee launched Pickett's Charge against the Union center, and almost three divisions were slaughtered. By this time, Stuart had returned, and he fought an inconclusive cavalry duel to the east of the main battlefield, attempting to drive into the Union rear area. The two armies stayed in position on July 4 (the same day the Battle of Vicksburg ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> Union victory), and then Lee ordered a retreat back across the Potomac to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two {{longtime}} coalition partners, the United People's Party (ZSL) and the Democratic Party (SD), broke their {{alliance with}} the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity. The last Communist Prime Minister of Poland, General Czesław Kiszczak, said he would resign to allow a non-Communist to form an administration. As Solidarity {{was the only other}} political grouping that could possibly form a government, it was virtually assured that a Solidarity member would become prime minister. On 19 August 1989, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning</b> watershed moment, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an anti-Communist editor, Solidarity supporter, and devout Catholic, was nominated as Prime Minister of Poland – and the Soviet Union voiced no protest. Five days later, on 24 August 1989, Poland's Parliament ended more than 40 years of one-party rule by making Mazowiecki the country's first non-Communist Prime Minister since the early postwar years. In a tense Parliament, Mazowiecki received 378 votes, with 4 against and 41 abstentions. On 13 September 1989 a new non-Communist government was approved by parliament, {{the first of its kind}} in the Eastern Bloc. On 17 November 1989 the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, Polish founder of the Cheka and symbol of Communist oppression, was torn down in Bank Square, Warsaw. On 29 December 1989 the Sejm amended the constitution to change the official name of the country from the People's Republic of Poland to the Republic of Poland. The communist Polish United Workers' Party dissolved itself on 29 January 1990 and transformed itself into the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland.|$|E

Stephen Holden of Blender called Wainwright's tribute [...] "a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled {{the spirit of the}} ultimate gay icon", and declared the album was [...] "as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any". Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote that Wainwright [...] "elegantly outdoes [...] on a couple of the ballads" [...] and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, [...] "who turns <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>stunning,</b> showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show". In his review for Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau stated it was [...] "a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and Tin Pan Alley chestnuts of this tribute album". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs [...] "expand [...] melodic compass", allowing him to [...] "bring something new to them too – namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense". Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine had positive comments about the album: [...] "That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic—and the chops to pull it off without breaking a limb or his brain—speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities." ...|$|E
