40|$|The {{analytical}} {{characterization of}} a multilayer fiber composite plate (without hole) was accomplished for both static and dynamic loading conditions using the finite difference technique. Thornel 300 / 5208 composites {{with and without}} holes were subjected to static and tensile fatigue testing. Five (5) fiber orientations were submitted to test. Tensile fatigue testing also included three (3) loading conditions and two (2) frequencies. The low-cycle test specimens demonstrated a shorter tensile fatigue life than the high-cycle test specimens. Failure surfaces demonstrated effect of testing conditions. Secondary failure mechanisms, such as: delamination, fiber breakage, and <b>edge</b> <b>fiber</b> delamination were present. Longitudinal delamination between plies also occurred in these specimens...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{oxidation}} {{studies of}} reinforced carbon/carbon (RCC) are discussed with {{particular emphasis on}} the resulting microstructures. This study involves laboratory furnace (500 - 1500 C deg) and arc-jet exposures (1538 C deg) on various forms of RCC. RCC without oxidation protection oxidized at 800 and 1100 C deg exhibits pointed and reduced diameter fibers, due to preferential attack along the <b>fiber</b> <b>edges.</b> RCC with a SiC conversion coating exhibits limited attack of the carbon substrate at 500, 700 and 1500 C deg. However samples oxidized at 900, 1100, and 1300 C deg show small oxidation cavities at the SiC/carbon interface below through-thickness cracks in the SiC coating. These cavities have rough <b>edges</b> with denuded <b>fibers</b> and can be easily distinguished from cavities created in processing. Arc-jet tests at 1538 C deg show limited oxidation attack when the SiC coating and glass sealants are intact. When the SiC/sealant protection system is damaged, attack is extensive and proceeds through matrix cracks, creating denuded <b>fibers</b> on the <b>edges</b> of the cracks. Even at 1538 C deg, where diffusion control dominates, attack is non-uniform with <b>fiber</b> <b>edges</b> oxidizing in preference to the bulk fiber and matrix...|$|R

40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in ring spinning. To understand the formation principle of the triangle zone, a dynamic mesh model with SIMPLEC algorithm is employed to study airflow around the rotating front roller-pair. The effects of both the top roller offset and the drafting inclination angle are also discussed. The bubble-type vortex breakdown and vortices around two cylinders are observed. The bubble-type vortices will help the <b>edge</b> <b>fibers</b> to converge to the center. A contour line with special value is defined to describe the spinning triangle. A dynamic triangle zone is also observed with time. As the forward offset of the top roller increases, the velocities in the stream-wise (x- and y-) directions decrease and the maximum values of the skin friction deflect gradually towards {{the apex of the}} roller. However, the z-velocity for the 3 mm top roller offset is the largest and results in a good converging for fibers and, consequently, increases the yarn tension. With increasing the inclination angle, the velocities increase while both the defined triangle zones and the maximum values of the friction coefficients decrease, thus speeding up the fibers transportation. The simulation results agree well with the theory analysis and experiments of spinning. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to develop an {{automated}} method of measuring fiber diameters of electrospun scaffolds from scanning electron microscopy images of these scaffolds. Several automated methods were developed and evaluated by comparison to known values and data obtained via the standard manual method. Simulated images with known diameters were used as test images to evaluate the accuracy of each measurement technique. Eight scanning electron microscopy images were also used {{for the evaluation of}} the automated methods compared to the standard manual method. All diameter measurements were made in pixels. Five new automated methods coded in MATLAB were developed. The five methods varied the approach of identifying <b>edges</b> of <b>fibers</b> as well as assigning <b>edges</b> to single <b>fibers</b> and calculating the distance between edges assigned to the same fiber. One-way analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer tests were performed for comparison of all methods per image.

30|$|Routine {{measurement}} of fiber diameter and its distribution {{are carried out}} by manual method. First the scale is set. Then, pixels between two <b>edges</b> of a <b>fiber</b> perpendicular to the fiber axis are counted. The number of the pixels is then converted to nm using the scale and the resulting diameter is recorded. On a typical image, the diameter of 100 fibers are measured using this method and the histogram of fiber diameter distribution is plotted. This process is very time-consuming and operator consistency and fatigue may reduce the accuracy. Identifying the <b>edges</b> of the <b>fibers</b> needs attention and the measurements are not exactly made perpendicular to the fiber axis. It cannot be used as on-line method for quality control, due to the need of an operator for measurement. Automating the fiber diameter measurement and eliminating {{the use of the}} human operator is a natural solution to this problem.|$|R

40|$|We {{used the}} {{acceleration}} {{at the onset}} of a force step to estimate the force experienced by the receiver. This requires information about the apparent mass of the system, which, for the fly’s receiver, seems remarkably constant, clustering around 5 ng in wild-type flies and mechanosensory mutants [S 1]. By fixing the mass to this value, we neglect individual mass variations. We note that most of the parameters used to describe the receiver’s mechanics are indepen-dent of mass: po, z, X 0, KGS=KN, the extent of nonlinearity, the com-pleteness of adaptation, and the single-channel gating energy. With our approach of force estimation, the only parameters that scale with mass are external force, stiffnesses, and F 0, whereby ratios be-tween forces (or stiffnesses) and mass can be directly assessed from the data.

40|$|AbstractMelt-blown {{nonwovens}} {{are widely}} used in filter materials, fiber diameters and distributions {{play an important role}} in affecting the filtration efficiency of melt-blown material. The traditional method of microfiber diameter testing mainly relies on manual measurement, which is time-consuming and inaccurate.

We consider the generality of an elastic material {{expressed as a}} fiberreinforced incompressible fluid. We show that, in the linear regime, any (possibly inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic) incompressible elastic material can be represented {{as a collection of}} fifteen families of straight, parallel elastic fibers embedded in an incompressible medium. We can choose these fiber directions to correspond to the fifteen diagonals of an icosahedron that connect the midpoints of its antipodal <b>edges.</b> This <b>fiber</b> architecture, together with the incompressible medium in which it is immersed, is universal and programmable in the sense that its elastic constants can be chosen to model any linear incompressible elastic material, without having to adapt the fiber architecture to the actual microstructure of the material.

It is stronger, has a higher strength to weight ratio than steel, and has a modulus that is five times greater than PET, and about {{twice as high as}} PEN. There are two popular types of Kevlar: Type 29 and Type 49, the latter having a 50% higher initial modulus than Type 29 but a lower flex loss. DuPont has developed higher modulus Types 129, 149 and 159, but these have seen little use in sails, since generally as the modulus increases the flex strength decreases. DuPont has recently introduced Kevlar <b>Edge,</b> a <b>fiber</b> developed specifically for sails with 25% higher flex strength and a higher modulus than Kevlar 49.Kevlar, along with other aramid fibers, have poor UV resistance (Kevlar loses strength roughly twice as quickly in sunlight as PET) and rapid loss of strength with flexing, folding and flogging.
