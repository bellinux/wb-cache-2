The wing has two levels overlooking the courtyard retaining their arcades (now glassed-in), {{which are the}} same shape {{as those in the}} south wing. The southeast end of the wing contained a <b>kitchen</b> (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> well) and a large pantry.|$|E

The three lower floors are cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for service rooms, with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E

At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E
25|$|The palace {{was mainly}} {{designed}} for comfort. On {{the ground floor}} of the palace was the <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large fireplace and oven. The first floor has the banqueting hall, and above on the second hall had bedrooms for the family. The original staircase leading up to the first floor was a wooden one which ran up the outside of the building; however, due to the wet climate a stone staircase was later added inside the palace.|$|E

25|$|Haggs Castle is {{an altered}} L-plan tower, of 4 storeys. The main block {{measures}} around 17m by 7.2m. The vaulted basement contained two chambers and a <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large fireplace. The main stair {{led up to}} the first floor, where a private room was located behind the main hall. Smaller corbelled stairs led to the upper storeys, which included a square caphouse above the stair tower. Square and round gun loops were located around the tower. The most striking feature is the carved decoration, including cable-moulded string courses, moulded corbels, and the carving over the door.|$|E

In December, David won the inaugural Asian Sportswoman of the Year, beating more than 100 competitors who represented 25 sporting bodies.|$|E
500|$|Somerhill {{is built}} of sandstone. The stone also {{contains}} iron, which {{gives it a}} red colour. This stone is known as Calverley Stone.

500|$|The Whopper Bar is {{a concept}} from the company that upends its {{traditional}} fast food operations with a newer high end concept designed to compete with fast casual and casual dining restaurants. The new format is described by the company as a more [...] "playful" [...] variation on the standard Burger King location. The locations feature an open <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> semi-circular metal counter top designed to allow customers to watch as its [...] "Whopperistas" [...] put together the order. The exposed kitchen concept allows customers to view the preparation of their foods. Decoration of the new locations is limited to plasma televisions playing looped videos of open flames. The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into malls, airports and casinos and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E
500|$|Hayley poses as {{a police}} officer and asks Jeff's ex-girlfriend, Janelle, to come {{immediately}} to Jeff's house. Jeff regains consciousness to find that Hayley has bound his wrists and hoisted him to stand on a chair in his <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> noose around his neck. [...] Hayley makes Jeff an offer: if he commits suicide, she promises to erase the evidence of his crimes, but if he refuses, she promises to expose his secrets. The conversation is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on the front door, selling Girl Scout cookies. Hayley tells the neighbor that she is Jeff's niece; the neighbor leaves shortly afterwards. When Hayley returns, Jeff breaks free from his bindings and pursues her, eventually finding her on the roof of his house, where she has lured him. Hayley has brought her rope from the kitchen and fashioned it into a noose secured to the chimney. Hayley keeps Jeff at bay with his own gun.|$|E
500|$|Bartlett's {{decision}} to deposit stores {{on the ice}} ensured that an ice camp, known as [...] "Shipwreck Camp", {{was more or less}} established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided [...] "substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time." [...] Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp {{in the direction of the}} island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.|$|E

500|$|The keep, or donjon, survives largely intact {{from the}} 13th century, and forms the {{south-west}} {{part of the}} present castle. Described by architectural historian W. D. Simpson as a [...] "cluster keep", it comprises a large round tower to the south, a smaller round tower to the west, with the two joined by a square tower. The masonry is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone blocks. Internally, the original use of the rooms is difficult to interpret, although the round towers may have served as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady. The large tower contains a six-sided chamber at ground level, possibly a <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> seven-sided main chamber above. This room has a pointed vaulted ceiling, window seats in the large windows around the south wall, and a carved fireplace at the north. To the east is a postern, or side door, and beyond is a well. Adjacent to the well is a floor hatch, which would have allowed food to be transferred directly from the kitchen to a servery above. A room in the square tower to the west, possibly the lord's bedroom, has holes in the ceiling to allow smoke from braziers to escape. The more ruined west round tower probably contained another hall, with chambers above and storage below. In the 17th century, {{the top of the}} main round tower was lowered and remodelled to form a gun platform.|$|E
500|$|Oppenheimer {{initially}} {{estimated that}} the work could be performed by 50 scientists and 50 technicians. Groves tripled this number to 300. The actual population, including family members, was about 3,500 {{by the end of}} 1943, 5,700 by the end of 1944, 8,200 by the end of 1945, and 10,000 by the close of 1946. The most desirable accommodation were the six existing log and stone cottages that had once housed the headmaster and the Los Alamos Ranch School faculty. They were the only dwellings at Los Alamos that had bathtubs, and became known as [...] "Bathtub Row". Oppenheimer lived on Bathtub Row; his next-door neighbor was Captain W. S. [...] "Deak" [...] Parsons, the head of the Ordnance and Engineering Division. Parsons' house was slightly larger, because Parsons had two children and Oppenheimer, at that point, had only one. After Bathtub Row, the next most desirable accommodation was the apartments built by Sundt. A typical two-storey building held four families. Each Sundt apartment had two or three bedrooms, a <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cranky black coal stove, and a small bathroom. J. E. Morgan and Sons supplied 56 prefabricated dwellings that became known as [...] "Morganville". The Robert E. McKee Company built a part of the town known as [...] "McKeeville". In June through October 1943, and again in June and July 1944, numbers outstripped the available accommodation and personnel were temporarily lodged in Frijoles Canyon.|$|E
