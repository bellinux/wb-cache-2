50|$|Composting toilets are {{designed}} to treat only toilet waste, rather than general residential waste water, and are typically used with water-free toilets rather than the flush toilets associated with the above types of aerobic treatment systems. These systems treat the waste as a moist solid, rather than in liquid suspension, and therefore separate urine from feces during treatment to maintain the correct moisture content in the system. An example of a composting toilet is the clivus multrum (Latin for 'inclined chamber'), which consists of an <b>inclined</b> <b>chamber</b> that separates urine and feces and a fan to provide positive ventilation and prevent odors from escaping through the toilet. Within the chamber, the urine and feces are independently broken down not only by aerobic bacteria, but also by fungi, arthropods, and earthworms. Treatment times are very long, with a minimum time between removals of solid waste of a year; during treatment {{the volume of the}} solid waste is decreased by 90 percent, with most being converted into water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pathogens are eliminated from the waste by the long durations in inhospitable conditions in the treatment chamber.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of behavior in small free-swimming aquatic organisms is described. In this procedure, called countercurrent separation, a dense solution flows down along the bottom of an <b>inclined</b> <b>chamber</b> while a light solution flows in the opposite direction, upward {{along the top of the}} chamber. The attraction of animals (injected into the center of the chamber) to one solution or the other is then determined by observing the proportion of animals that emerges from the chamber in that solution. When used with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is estimated that the apparatus is equivalent to at least nine theoretical plates...|$|E

40|$|The {{stationary}} and transient {{processes in}} the system of variable-frequency asynchronous drives, controlling the motion parameters of metal cable conductor with polymer insulation in the <b>inclined</b> vulcanization <b>chamber</b> are studied. The analytical expressions for matching the required tension of free sagging metal conductor with camera parameters are determined. It has been created the Simulink-model for regulation of transient electrical and mechanical processes, such as vibration of moving conductor in the transverse and longitudinal directions {{taking into account the}} changes of the conductor parameters, retarding forces and supply voltage...|$|R
50|$|Stepwells usually {{consist of}} two parts: a {{vertical}} shaft from which water is drawn {{and the surrounding}} <b>inclined</b> subterranean passageways, <b>chambers</b> and steps which provide access to the well. The galleries and chambers surrounding these wells were often carved profusely with elaborate detail and became cool, quiet retreats during the hot summers.|$|R
5000|$|With alloy {{cylinder}} head, hemi-spherical combustion <b>chambers,</b> <b>inclined</b> valves [...] and twin side-draft SU carburetors, {{the dual}} overhead-cam 3.4 L straight-6 XK engine was comparatively advanced for a mass-produced {{unit of the}} time. With standard 8:1 compression ratio it developed , using 80 octane fuel. Most of the early cars were exported; a 7:1 low-compression version, with consequently reduced performance, was reserved for the UK market, where the post-war austerity measures then in force restricted buyers to 70 octane [...] "Pool petrol". The Jaguar factory, with access to 80 octane fuel, provided roadsters with the higher compression ratio to the press. Journalists could then test the model's optimum performance in Belgium, on a long, straight stretch of road between Jabbeke and Ostend. The XK engine's basic design, later modified into 3.8 and 4.2 litre versions, survived into the late 1980s.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{test section}} for a supersonic or hypersonic wind tunnel is disclosed wherein the model tested is shielded from the noise normally radiated by the turbulent tunnel wall boundary layer. A vacuum plenum surrounds spaced rod elements {{making up the}} test chamber to extract some of the boundary layer as formed along the rod elements during a test to thereby delay the tendency of the rod boundary layers to become turbulent. Novel rod construction involves bending each rod slightly prior to machining the bent area to provide a flat segment on each rod for connection with the flat entrance fairing. Rods and fairing are secured to provide a test <b>chamber</b> <b>incline</b> {{on the order of}} 1 deg outward from the noise shield centerline to produce up to 65 % reduction of the root mean square (rms) pressure over previously employed wind tunnel test sections at equivalent Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|Ignition and {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} diesel spray impinging on an inclined wall were experimentally investigated. Ignition position and appearance {{position of the}} luminous flame kernel were stereoscopically observed using a two-way fiber optical system. Flat impingement wall was fixed in a high temperature, high pressure combustion <b>chamber.</b> <b>Inclined</b> angle of the flat wall was set at 30 degees or right angle against the center axis of the injection spray. Distance from nozzle tip to the impingement point on the wall was set at 50 mm. Effect of ambient temperature on ignition position was investigated. As the result, ignition positions were observed near the spray periphery in the both cases of 30 degrees and right angle impingements. However, the luminous flame appeared near the wall surface at downword side of inclined wall because the fuel rich region was formed around the downword side of spray impingement point...|$|R
