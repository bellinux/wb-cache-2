5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and <b>Deutsche</b> <b>mark</b> found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>mark</b> and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark)</b> and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency {{is regarded as a}} safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E

5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured as {{well that}} Germany could return to the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark,</b> or create another {{currency}} union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus {{in support of a}} job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and that held in Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.|$|E

[...] Kuczynski concluded that the German Federal Republic should pay victims of forced labour under Nazi Germany approximately 180 Billion <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b> Later, in his book [...] "Brosamen vom Herrentisch", he increased his estimate to 228 Billion <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> (equivalent to €116 Billion).|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{monthly rate}} of pay was 5000 <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> and the initial number of {{employees}} was 5000 (3500 in Wolfsburg and 1500 additional jobs at Hanover) hence the company name.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{the work}} was planned to be {{completed}} in 1999 at a total cost of 3.5 billion <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b> The travelling time between Halle/Leipzig and Berlin would be less than an hour.|$|R
25|$|On 6 November 1999, Montenegro decided that, {{besides the}} Yugoslav dinar, the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> {{would also be}} an {{official}} currency. On November 13, 2000, the dinar was dropped and the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> (by that time {{defined in terms of}} the euro) became the only currency. In 2003, the end of Yugoslavia led to the dinar, by then only used in Serbia, being replaced at par by the Serbian dinar.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the switch}} to the euro, the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> was the largest {{international}} reserve currency after the United States dollar.|$|E
25|$|United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey {{reportedly}} {{chose not}} to join the ERM in 1979 owing to concerns that it would benefit the German economy by preventing the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>mark</b> from appreciating, {{at the expense of}} the economies of other countries.|$|E
50|$|The song {{reached the}} top places of the East German music charts in 1974, and 40th place in the 1975 full-year charts Heubach was paid around 10,000 East German <b>marks</b> and 500 <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1995, {{the public}} {{prosecution}} {{department of the}} city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b> In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, {{the company was}} one of the top five German kitchen {{manufacturers}} with a revenue of 100 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b> From 1973 onwards, it began exporting its products to members of the then European Economic Community.|$|R
25|$|The Serbian dinar {{replaced}} the Yugoslav dinar at par in 2003, when Yugoslavia {{was transformed into}} the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro and the disputed territory of Kosovo have already adopted the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> and later the euro when the mark was replaced by it.|$|E
25|$|For {{several months}} after the July 1990 {{adoption}} of the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark,</b> low value GDR coinage (up to 50 Pfennig) continued to circulate in the former GDR as legal tender, because the Bundesbank could not deliver enough small coins quickly enough to replace the former GDR coins.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1990, {{the process}} of German reunification had {{advanced}} far, with the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> being introduced in the East {{two days before the}} semifinals on 3 July. Unlike in previous decades, East German fans could openly support the German team of the DFB which by then had an 80+ year tradition.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, many notable {{businessmen}} joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> on behalf of the British government.|$|R
50|$|After {{ratification}} of the Agreement and specifying the relevant regulations, West Berliners could apply {{for the first time}} again for visas for any chosen date to East Berlin or East Germany from 3 October 1972 onwards. If granted, a one-day-visa entitled them to leave the East until 2 am the following day. West Berliners were now spared the visa fee of 5 Western <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks,</b> {{not to be confused with}} the compulsory exchange amounting to the same sum, but yielding in return 5 Eastern marks. This financial relief did not last long, because on 15 November 1973 East Germany doubled the compulsory exchange to 10 Eastern marks, payable in West German <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> at par.|$|R
50|$|He {{travelled}} to Vienna, Austria, {{which was}} at the time crawling with StB officers due to its proximity to Czechoslovakia, where he was given 1,500 <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> and given the code name Anna. In July, he signed a document indicating his links to the StB.|$|R
25|$|Between July 1, 1990 (the {{currency}} union with East Germany) and July 1, 1991, East German coins in denominations up to 50 pfennigs continued to circulate as <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> coins at their face value, owing to a temporary shortage of small coins. These coins were legal tender {{only in the}} territory of the former East Germany.|$|E
25|$|The 501A was {{released}} in 1954 {{as a replacement for}} the original 501 with similar trim and equipment, but which sold for DM14,180, a price reduction of more than eight hundred <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> from the original 501. The 501B was a decontented version that sold for DM500 less than the 501A. Both the 501A and 501B used a revised M337 engine.|$|E
25|$|When Helmut Kohl, then German Chancellor, asked Mitterrand {{to agree}} to reunification (France {{was one of the}} four Allies who had {{to agree to}} the Two Plus Four-treaty), Mitterrand told Kohl he {{accepted}} it only in the event Germany would abandon the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> and adopt the Euro. Kohl accepted this package deal (even without talking to Karl Otto Pöhl, then President of the Bundesbank).|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Walther had {{a special}} limited edition of the GSP {{designated}} as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition). The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish. At the time, these sold for 2,549 <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b>|$|R
50|$|North Korea sold bonds internationally in {{the late}} 1970s for 680 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>marks</b> and 455 million Swiss francs. North Korea {{defaulted}} on these bonds by 1984, although the bonds remain traded internationally on speculation that the country will eventually perform on the obligations.|$|R
50|$|A {{renovation}} of the main building, which had been planned in 1980, was deferred to 1990. The reason given was that the building was now under a preservation order. The 4.4 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> project provided the station with a travel centre, a shop and a bistro.|$|R
25|$|The East German {{mark was}} officially valued by the East German {{government}} at parity with the (West German) <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark.</b> However, {{because it was}} not readily convertible and the GDR's export profile was restricted, it was practically worthless outside East Germany. The few East Germans able to visit the West often found themselves having to rely on their West German relatives as a result.|$|E
25|$|The United States and Germany {{signed an}} {{agreement}} on September 19, 1995, providing for reparations for certain U.S.-citizen survivors of the Holocaust, with compensation to be paid in two stages. The first stage provided for compensation for Hugo Princz and {{a small group of}} other known concentration camp survivors, through a lump-sum payment to the United States of 3 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> (about $2.1 million). The second stage was to provide for compensation for additional, similarly-situated claimants. Legislation passed in early 1996 authorized the Commission to receive and adjudicate cases of additional claimants, a process which it completed in March 1998. Following further negotiations, the German Government paid to the United States in June 1999 an additional lump sum of 34.5 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> (about $18 million) in final settlement of any and all claims of United States citizens against Germany for Nazi persecution in concentration camps, {{whether or not they were}} adjudicated by the Commission. In the ensuing months, the Department of the Treasury completed the process of distributing the settlement fund to the claimants previously found eligible for awards.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, Montenegro {{began to}} sever {{economic}} ties with Serbia as it formed {{a new economic}} policy and adopted the <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Mark</b> as its currency. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade. Also, separatist Albanian paramilitaries began a steady escalation of violence in 1998. The question whether the Federal Yugoslav state would continue to exist became a very serious issue to the government.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, Haerlin {{gave the}} hotel to his son Fritz (1897-1975). The hotel {{remained}} family-owned until 1989, when it was sold for 210 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> to hotelier Hiroyoshi Aoki. The furniture that Haerlin used during the century he owned the hotel was used up until 2001.|$|R
50|$|On December 29, 1930 Nissen's widow Kathie {{succumbed to}} a stroke. From her estate, {{she gave the}} town of Husum $170,000, so the total {{inheritance}} for the city from the Nissens was 3 million <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks.</b> Thus, Ludwig Nissen's testamentary plans in Husum could be realized.|$|R
50|$|With the {{large-scale}} {{profile of the}} new line that had originally been planned, an extraordinarily complex set of lines was considered in the different options. It was estimated that the 18 km long comparison section in Kassel would cost 1.6 to 2.5 billion <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Marks</b> (1975 prices).|$|R
