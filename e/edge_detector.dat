40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) This {{dissertation}} concerns {{itself with}} the evaluation of <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> Existing evaluation methods are described and discussed. Various <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> are described and used to obtain experimental results. A new evaluation method which takes into consideration both a subjective and. non-subjective component is proposed. This new method {{is not meant to}} be definitive. The {{reason for this is that}} the author feels that this dissertation should primarily highlight the factors that are important in evaluating <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> It was found that if it is not possible to set parameters for more sophisticated <b>edge</b> <b>detectors,</b> they do not always produce better results than the simpler methods such as the Sobel operator...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} a system, called SED, "Se-lection of Edge DetectorsN, {{which is}} able to automati-cally select <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> and their scales to extract a given edge. The basic organization of the SED system {{is a collection of}} <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> within a knowledge structure about the characteristics of the given edge, the properties of the detectors and the mutual relation between them. The combination of this information in the selection process provides a basis for avoiding a combinatorial search for appropriate <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> We illustrate our approach by an example. ...|$|R

40|$|We propose an optimization-based {{framework}} for designing linear <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> for topographic maps of cave inscriptions. This optimization framework requires an edge model, which is constructed from sample images. The optimization criteria are described and genetic algorithms {{are employed in}} an iterative fashion for finding optimal <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> Thus, the optimization framework consists roughly of three steps: modeling a representative edge, forming the objective function for optimization, and choosing the optimization method. An additional preprocessing step is also described for removing special types of noise before applying the <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of our method on sample topographic maps...|$|R

50|$|Deriche {{has made}} major {{contributions}} to the scientific community, mainly in image processing, computer vision and neuro-imaging. In 1987, Deriche has developed Deriche <b>Edge</b> <b>Detector</b> which is a low-level, recursively implemented, optimal <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> based on Canny's <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> criteria for optimal edge detection. In 1998, following his remarkable works in Computational image processing, Early vision, 3D reconstruction, panoramic photography, image-based modeling, and motion analysis, he co-founded with his Inria colleagues (among which O. Faugeras, T. Papadopoulo and L. Robert),  Realviz, a start-up specialized in image-based content creation solutions for the film, broadcast, gaming, digital imaging and architecture. The startup was acquired by Autodesk in 2008. Deriche is currently devoting his research to explore the Central Nervous System by developing mathematical models and tools to reconstruct the functional and anatomical connections network of the brain.|$|E

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. Section 2 concerns the brief {{analysis of a}} set of popular <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> that will be used in this work. Section 3 presents two novel approaches for the quantitative combination of multiple <b>edge</b> <b>detectors.</b> Section 4 contains experimental results yielded using our implementation of the automatic edge detection algorithms together with a comparative study of the methods' performance. Conclusions are given in Section 5.|$|R
50|$|Nonlinear channels: There {{are many}} {{non-linear}} channels. The most popular ones are canny <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> and gradient magnitude. Canny gives the edge information whereas gradient magnitude gives edge strength.|$|E
50|$|In {{automated}} {{analysis of}} digital images, a subproblem often arises of detecting simple shapes, such as straight lines, circles or ellipses. In many cases an <b>edge</b> <b>detector</b> {{can be used}} as a pre-processing stage to obtain image points or image pixels that are on the desired curve in the image space. Due to imperfections in either the image data or the <b>edge</b> <b>detector,</b> however, there may be missing points or pixels on the desired curves as well as spatial deviations between the ideal line/circle/ellipse and the noisy edge points as they are obtained from the <b>edge</b> <b>detector.</b> For these reasons, it is often non-trivial to group the extracted edge features to an appropriate set of lines, circles or ellipses. The purpose of the Hough transform is to address this problem by making it possible to perform groupings of edge points into object candidates by performing an explicit voting procedure over a set of parameterized image objects (Shapiro and Stockman, 304).|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a strong multiplicative noise known as speckle complicates edge detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and makes usual <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> inefficient. However, speckle is very well modelled statistically, and we here use this property to develop two non-linear multiresolution <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> for SAR images. A normalized ratio of local averages {{on opposite sides of}} the central pixel is computed in different directions and on different resolution levels for every pixel position. The pixelwise maximum or mean value over all scales yields an edge strength map, from which the edges are finally extracted. The difference between our approach and wavelet-based edge detection is briefly discussed, some statistical properties are examined, and the improvement compared to <b>edge</b> <b>detectors</b> operating on one single scale is shown on simulated SAR data...|$|R
50|$|The Canny-Deriche {{detector}} {{was derived}} from similar mathematical criteria as the Canny <b>edge</b> <b>detector,</b> although starting from a discrete viewpoint and then leading {{to a set of}} recursive filters for image smoothing instead of exponential filters or Gaussian filters.|$|E

To develop such study we have used ROSA Analyser tool which generates the Labelled Transition System, LTS, corresponding to a process specified in the Markovian Process Algebra ROSA. ROSA Analyser takes as input the syntactical representation of the process and once its syntactical structure has been properly layered represented-internally- by the tool, it applies the Operational Semantics of ROSA, so producing the corresponding LTS, which shows all the possible behaviours of the system we are interested in. A clear advantage, also from the computational point of view, of the encoder using Rough Sets Theory has been found. I...|$|R
