40|$|Abstract- Problematic {{use of the}} Internet by {{children}} and adolescents is a newly emerging disorder that has alerted health authorities throughout the world. In Iran, despite the very high speed rate of Internet spread, {{there is not enough}} data on the rate of Internet addiction among the adolescents. This study is the first nationwide study that addresses this issue. Overall 4500 students of high school or pre-college schools were recruited from 13 / 31 provinces of Iran by a cluster sampling method and 4342 (96 %) participated. Two self-rated questionnaires (one demographics and one Young’s Internet addiction scale) were filled b the participants. Data were analyzed by SPSS software. 962 (22. 2 %) of the study participants were labeled as having “internet addiction. " Males {{were significantly more likely to}} be an <b>internet</b> <b>addict</b> (P< 0. 001). Students whose father and/or mother had a doctorate degree were most likely to have Internet addiction (P< 0. 001 for both). Job engagement of mothers was significantly associated with students ’ internet addiction, and the least rate of addiction was observed when the mother was a housewife (P< 0. 001); having no exercise was associated with the highest rate of Internet addiction (P< 0. 001). Stepwise logistic regression models showed gender (male), older age, mother’s occupation, family’s financial status (either very high or very low), low quality of family relationship, and students ’ lower levels of religious devotion were significantly associated with having Internet addiction.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the relationship between Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and depression was conducted; a total of 22 papers met inclusion criteria. The review was structured by three questions: 1) Is there an association between IGD and depression? 2) What mediators and moderators may be involved in this relationship? 3) Is there any evidence to suggest causal pathways? The majority of the reviewed research identified an association between IGD and depression. Some potential mediators and moderators were identified, including self-esteem and loneliness, although methodological limitations restricted the inferences that could be drawn from the findings. The research {{is still in its infancy}} and more sophisticated research methods are required to further understand the nature of the association between IGD and depression. A quasi-experimental design was used to explore the proposed association between reward disturbances, internet addiction and depression. Specifically, it was hypothesised that the <b>internet</b> <b>addict</b> group would experience reduced ‘liking’ of positive stimuli and increased ‘wanting’ of internet stimuli, whilst being less motivated to obtain reward in comparison with controls. The internet addiction group reported significantly higher depression scores, however there were no differences in groups’ ‘liking’ of stimuli, yet the internet addiction group reported greater arousal overall. There were no between group differences for motivation, although within group correlations revealed that for the internet addiction group there was a dissociation between ‘liking’ of rewards and motivation to obtain them; there was also a positive correlation between BDI-II scores and motivation. These findings were not in line with hypotheses, and may suggest that the internet addiction group experience greater reward sensitivity, and are therefore drawn to internet use to satiate this heightened rewardsensitivity; or that internet addiction may serve as a form of experiential avoidance, thus potentially maintaining depression...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} of Internet overuse with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Methods: A total of 2336 high school students in South Korea (boys, 57. 5 %; girls, 42. 5 %) completed the structured questionnaire. The severity of Internet addiction was evaluated using Young’s Internet addiction test. Results: The proportions of boys who were classified as <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> and possible <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> were 2. 5 % and 53. 7 %, respectively. For girls, the corre-sponding proportions were 1. 9 % and 38. 9 %, respec-tively. The prevalence of EDS was 11. 2 % (boys, 11. 2 %; girls, 11. 1 %). When <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> were compared with non-addicts, they consisted of more boys, drank alcohol more, and considered their own health condition as poor. But smoking was not related with Internet addiction. The prevalence rate of EDS for <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> was 37. 7 %, whereas that for possible <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> and non-addicts was 13. 9 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. The prevalence of insomnia, witnessed snoring, apnea, teeth grinding, and nightmares was highest in <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts,</b> middle in possible addicts, and lowest in non-addicts. With adjustment for duration of Internet use, duration of sleep time, age, gender, smoking, taking painkillers due to headache, insomnia symptoms, witnessed apnea, and nightmares, the odds of EDS were 5. 2 -fold greater (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 7 – 10. 2) in <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> and 1. 9 -fold greater (95 %CI: 1. 4 – 2. 6) in possible <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> com-pared to non-addicts. Conclusion: Internet addiction is strongly associated with EDS in adolescents. Clinicians should consider examining Internet addiction in adolescent cases of EDS.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to explore heart rate variability frequency field characteristics and personality influential factors of internet addicts by experimentation and questionnaire. Two studies were carried out: study 1 was to explore the pathological and mental mechanism of internet addicts by heart rate variability physiological index and EPQ and internet addiction scale. Study 2 was to compare the personality and mental characteristics between internet addicts and Non-addicts. The testees were 30 <b>internet</b> <b>addict</b> schoolboys who were in-patient and 43 schoolboys who accorded with qualification from grade 2 in senior high school and sophomore. It is found that: 1 、	Internet addicts have obviously lower HFNU than Non-addicts， but have obviously higher LFNU and LF/HF ratio than Non-addicts. Internet addicts have dysfunction in their sympathetic and parasympathetic system; 2 、	Internet addicts and Non-addicts have no significant difference in their EPQ except their lying point, but the nervous characteristics of EPQ of internet addicts have influence on their equipoise of parasympathetic system, that is to say when the score of nervous characteristics of EPQ become higher, equipoise of parasympathetic system become worse and worse. However the EPQ personality characteristics of non-addicts have no influence on their sympathetic and parasympathetic system. 3 、	The extent of internet addiction of the internet addicts is independent of their equipoise of parasympathetic system, but non-addicts use internet more time, their equipoise of parasympathetic system become lower, there is the significant difference in the neurophysiology between internet addicts and non-addicts. That is to say internet environment is safe to most adolescent, they can make use of internet environment accurately, but internet addicts, their physiological and psychological level has changed to a certain, need to be treated. ； 4 、	Serious internet game addicts have the metal characteristics of low social support, low purpose in life and low adventure; 5 、	The objective support、support utilization of social support questionnaire and sensation seeking characteristics have prognosticative function for internet addiction degree; 6 、	Serious internet game addicts have the metal characteristics of low social support, low lying particularity, they are inclined to self abandonment. Serious internet game addicts of low N characteristic have high sensation seeking characteristic, and at the same E personality foundation, they also seek new stimulus with higher intension.

40|$|Making social {{networking}} accessible {{to people with}} disability doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have to be expensive and complicated, writes Dr. Scott Hollier for ABC Ramp Up. It 2 ̆ 7 s {{fair to say that}} social media is taking over the world. At least the online parts of it. It allows for everything from close personal connection to cheap pizza. As a legally blind <b>internet</b> <b>addict,</b> social media has become a way of life. The trouble is that these complex websites and applications are rife with issues that can completely prevent access for people with a disability. Shockingly, testing conducted last year by Denis Boudreau of Accessibilite Web found that every popular {{social networking}} site was inaccessible. LinkedIn scored highest with 29 per cent, while Facebook, with its 10 million Australian users, scored just 9 per cent. Twitter won the wooden spoon with a rating of zero as every element of its website was considered inaccessible. Issues range from a lack of captioning to vital functions being invisible to assistive technology. The solutions to such problems most often don 2 ̆ 7 t come from the multi-million dollar social media companies themselves, but the dedicated users who find a way. I wanted to share this knowledge so that everyone, no matter their disability or level of tech-savviness, can benefit from social media. So Media Access Australia brought people with a range of disabilities together to learn how they, as social media users, close the digital divide. The responses we received were fantastic in terms of providing tips and tricks on social media accessibility. One recommendation was to use Easychirp, a simple web interface which makes Twitter possible for people who are blind or vision impaired. Another highlight of the project was learning about how different people used social media in different ways. For one young deaf woman, social media was viewed as the gateway to interacting with people without prejudice. Going to parties was often a difficult experience due to her hearing impairment, so using Facebook allowed her to meet some of the guests online first and have some great conversations. This meant that when she went to the party, there were people she already knew and understood the easiest way to talk to her. There 2 ̆ 7 s also the story of a blind person who looked to LinkedIn as a way to find employment. Given the high level of unemployment among people who are blind or vision impaired - some 65 per cent of us - the idea that he could put his rumonline and connect with potential employers was really appealing. While he hasn 2 ̆ 7 t found a job just yet, the rapidly increasing use of social media provides hope that having one extra way to promote his skills may make the difference. But perhaps my favourite story of all was from a person with a mobility issue who explained to me that the best thing about social media was access to cheap pizza. He explained to me that because he didn 2 ̆ 7 t drive and wasn 2 ̆ 7 t a very good cook, he often ordered in pizza. He says the best discount coupons are always on Facebook. For me, the diversity of these stories sums up the benefits of social media beautifully; it can be as profound as addressing prejudice or gaining employment, but can also just be about cheap pizza. The SociABILITY: social media for people with a disability guides new users through Facebook, Twitter, Skype, LinkedIn, YouTube and blogging. The project has been a labour of love for me and I really hope you find it useful. Dr Scott Hollier is a Project Manager at Media Access Australia.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{functional}} disconnectivity in <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs fMRI). <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> and demographically similar non-addicts were scanned using rs fMRI. For the connectivity analysis, Regions Of Interests (ROIs) were defined based on previous studies of addictions. The functional connectivity assessment for each subject was obtained by correlating time-series across the ROIs, resulting in 8 x 8 matrix for each subject. Within-group functional connectivity patterns were observed by entering the z maps of the ROIs of each subject into second-level one sample t test. Two sample t test was also performed to examine differences between two groups. A significant increase was observed in positive functional connectivity between the Orbito Frontal Cortex (OFC) and several brain regions in the non-addicted group. However, no significant correlations in these structural connectivities were found in the Internet addiction group. The Internet addiction group presented significant negative connectivity between the OFC and insula. Our findings provide the evidence that <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> have aberrant functional connectivity in the corticostriatal circuit at resting state. Particularly, we suggest that the OFC, which is associated with processing negative affect and behavioral inhibition, may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the Internet addiction.

The time focus of the human psyche reveals itself in the speed and duration of perception, impression, memory, thought and emotions peculiar to people with a certain temperament and of a certain age, sex and group. Time perception {{is an integral part of}} our mental processes. A human being is inclined to consider all events and processes taking place around him as a process which takes time.

40|$|Abstract Background Paralleling {{the rapid}} growth in {{computers}} and internet connections, adolescent internet addiction (AIA) is becoming an increasingly serious problem, especially in developing countries. This study aims to explore the prevalence of AIA and associated symptoms in a large population-based sample in Shanghai and identify potential predictors related to personal characteristics. Methods In 2007, 5, 122 adolescents were randomly chosen from 16 high schools of different school types (junior, senior key, senior ordinary and senior vocational) in Shanghai with stratified-random sampling. Each student completed a self-administered and anonymous questionnaire that included DRM 52 Scale of Internet-use. The DRM 52 Scale was adapted for use in Shanghai from Young’s Internet Addiction Scale and contained 7 subscales related to psychological symptoms of AIA. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were both {{used to analyze the}} data. Results Of the 5, 122 students, 449 (8. 8 %) were identified as <b>internet</b> <b>addicts.</b> Although adolescents who had bad (vs. good) academic achievement had lower levels of internet-use (p 100 RMB (all p-values < 0. 05). Adolescents tended to develop AIA and show symptoms in all subscales when they spent more hours online weekly (however, more <b>internet</b> <b>addicts</b> overused <b>internet</b> on weekends than on weekdays, p < 0. 0001) or when they used the internet mainly for playing games or real-time chatting. Conclusions This study provides evidence that adolescent personal factors play key roles in inducing AIA. Adolescents having aforementioned personal characteristics and online behaviors are at high-risk of developing AIA that may compound different psychological symptoms associated with AIA. Spending excessive time online is not in itself a defining symptom of AIA. More attention is needed on adolescent excessive weekend internet-use in prevention of potential <b>internet</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Although {{cognitive}} behavioral {{model of}} Internet addiction {{has been well}} described, studies on metacognitions and ruminative response styles related with Internet addiction are very limited. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare metacognitions and ruminative response style in <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts</b> with a healthy control group. Method: The study included 30 males who presented to our Internet Addiction Outpatient clinic, and diagnosed with Internet addiction, and a control group of 30 healthy males with similar sociodemographic characteristics. A sociodemographic data form, Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ- 30), Ruminative Response Scale-short version (RRS-SV), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used for data collection. Results: The MCQ- 30 total, MCQ- 30 uncontrollability and danger score, MCQ- 30 need to control thoughts score and RRS-SV scores statistically significantly higher in study group compared the control group. After correcting for BDI by ANCOVA, the difference between MCQ- 30 total score and RRS-SV disappeared.

The questionnaire consisted of eight questions from Young’s Diagnostic Test for Internet Addiction (YDTIA) as well as an inventory including demographic factors and questions about academic performance, computer and Internet use. YDTIA had a good reliability and diagnostic accuracy, tested with Cronbach’s alpha (0. 71) and sensitivity analysis. Results show that the percentage of IA (5 - 8 YDTIA criteria) is 11. 6 %, while problematic Internet users were (3 - 8 YDTIA criteria) 34. 7 %. Men were more likely to be <b>addicted</b> to the <b>Internet</b> than women, and <b>Internet</b> <b>addicted</b> students were associated with poorer academic performance.

5000|$|A {{complete}} {{review of}} the Internet addiction research by Byun et al. in 2008 demonstrated significant, multiple flaws in most studies in this area. In that article, the researchers wrote, [...] "The analysis showed that previous studies have utilized inconsistent criteria to define <b>Internet</b> <b>addicts,</b> applied recruiting methods that may cause serious sampling bias, and examined data using primarily exploratory rather than confirmatory data analysis techniques to investigate the degree of association rather than causal relationships among variables." [...] However, {{a significant amount of}} research has been released since 2008, {{partly as a result of}} the American Psychiatric Association's inclusion of internet and gaming use disorder as a condition of further study.|$|R
40|$|Background: Due {{to lack of}} {{evidence}} of Internet addiction（ IA） in Japan, we investigated IA and examined {{the utility of the}} Japanese version of the Internet Addiction Test（ JIAT） for screening for IA in adolescents. Method: 299 college students were divided into two groups （Internet Addiction group: IAG and Non-Internet Addiction group: NIAG）. A self report questionnaire was employed. Results: The IAG showed more problematic Internet use and poorer mental health than the NIAG. The JIAT showed good reliability and validity. To identify IA, we set the cut-off of the JIAT at ＞ 53. Conclusions: 5 ． 0 % of Japanese college students were identified as <b>internet</b> <b>addicted,</b> and they exhibited poor mental health. The JIAT can be useful as a screening tool for IA...|$|R
40|$|The Internet as {{a social}} media space implies its own terms as far as its operation, social {{interaction}} and influence are concerned. In this, excessive Internet use – especially among young people –, occasionally indicates the existence of certain disorders such as addiction, depression or even co-morbidity of disorders. This study aimed at investigating {{the extent to which}} Greek students are <b>Internet</b> over-users/ <b>addicted</b> and furthermore answering the hypotheses whether Internet addiction is correlated to certain personality traits (namely openness and extraversion) and depression, controlling for certain demographics such as gender and faculty of studies (Social, Humanities Vs Exact Sciences). The sample consisting of N = 404 students from the Social Sciences, Humanities and Exact Sciences departments of Greek universities and technical colleges were administered a self-reporting questionnaire on Internet addiction, personality traits-NEO-FFI, Depression (CES-D) and demographics. Results show that a rather low percentage of students fulfilled the criteria to be considered as <b>Internet</b> <b>addicted,</b> and this was associated mainly with openness and only marginaly with neuroticism regarding the Big-Five Personality factors. Further analysis controlling for Depression, gender and type of studies showed that the association between Big-Five and Internet addiction was even weaker, pointing out that this association is confounded by the factors included in the analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of internet has caused new psychological, social, and educational problems for the students. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the quality of life in medical students who suffer from internet addiction. This cross-sectional survey was carried out in Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and a total of 174 fourth-to seventh-year undergraduate medical students were enrolled. The quality of life was assessed by WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire which covers four domains of physical health, psychological, social relationships, and the environment. For assessing internet addiction, we used Internet Addiction Test (IAT) of Young. The students with IAT score higher than 50 were considered as addicted. For evaluating academic performance, the students were requested to report their grade point average (GPA). The mean IA score (±SD) was 34. 13 ± 12. 76. Twenty-eight students (16. 90 %) had IAT score above 50. The mean quality of life score in <b>internet</b> <b>addicted</b> group was 54. 97 ± 11. 38 versus 61. 65 ± 11. 21 in normal group (P = 0. 005). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between IA score and physical domain (r=- 0. 18, P = 0. 02); psychological domain (r=- 0. 35, P = 0. 000); and social relation domain (r=- 0. 26, P = 0. 001). Mean GPA was significantly lower in the addicted group. It seems that quality of life is lower in the <b>internet</b> <b>addicted</b> medical students; moreover, such students academically perform poorer in comparison with non-addicts. Since internet addiction is increasing at a rapid pace which may provoke considerable academic, psychological and social implications; as a result, it may require screening programs to the immediate finding of such problem to give consultations to prevent unwanted complications...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{addiction}} {{behavior was}} examined in 6, 121 Chinese {{primary and secondary}} school students in Hong Kong based on the assessment frameworks of Ivan Goldberg and Kimberly Young. Results showed that scales derived from both frameworks (CIA-Goldberg Scale and CIA-Young Scale) were internally consistent and evidence supporting their validity was found. Descriptive statistical analyses revealed that roughly one-fifth of the respondents {{could be classified as}} <b>Internet</b> <b>addicted</b> based on either scale. Further analyses showed that Internet-addicted and -nonaddicted respondents differed in their Internet use and related behavior. Logistic regression analyses showed that engagement in certain on-line activities (such as playing on-line games and downloading software) and replacement of pastimes activities (such as watching TV and going out with friends) with Internet activities predicted a higher probability of Internet addiction...|$|R
40|$|Internet gaming {{disorder}} (IGD) is {{the most}} prevalent subcategory of internet addiction. It {{has been associated with}} self-concept deficits and related characteristics such as emotional as well as social competence deficits, increased social anxiety and a stronger identification with the own avatar (i. e. a graphical agent that often seems to be constructed according to gamers’ ideal). In addition, IGD seems to be linked with inhibitory control deficits, definable as impairments in the inhibition of reactions to irrelevant stimuli during the pursuit of cognitively represented goals. However, the neurobiological correlates of avatar compared to self and ideal-related identification processing as well as emotional inhibitory control in (socially) anxious contexts as potentially important factors in IGD development have not been explored yet. The brain region of the left angular gyrus (AG) has been associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective in healthy controls and showed avatar-related hyperactivation in long-term online gamers during a task on self and avatar reflection in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) seems {{to be involved in the}} integration of negative affect and cognitive control. Based on these observations, <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> were neurobiologically examined by means of fMRI with a focus on the left AG as well as the dACC while completing specific tasks and compared to non-addicted controls as well as social media addicts. Hereby, participants’ concepts of self, ideal and avatar were assessed with a reflection task asking for the evaluation of characteristics regarding the self, ideal and own avatar. Emotional inhibitory control in a socially anxious context was neurobiologically explored by means of an emotional Stroop task (EST) assessing the inhibition on socially anxious words compared to positive, negative and neutral word stimuli under parallel reaction time recording. In addition, the emotional inhibitory control at anxious stimuli was examined neuropsychologically by means of an affective Go/No-Go task (AGN). Besides, psychometric questionnaires assessing impulsivity, emotional competence and social anxiety were applied. <b>Internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> showed significantly higher levels of impulsivity, social anxiety and emotional competence deficits relative to non-addicted controls in psychometric measures. Neurobiologically, <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> exhibited left AG hyperactivations during the reflection on their own avatar relative to self and ideal reflection within their group as well as compared to non-addicted controls. In the EST, <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> had longer reaction times during the inhibition on socially anxious compared to positive and negative words as well as compared to positive, negative and neutral words together. During the latter comparison, <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> neurobiologically showed significant hypoactivations in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus (MTG and STG), which was also significantly lower relative to social media addicts. Functional alterations in the dACC were not observed. Neuropsychologically, no significant differences in emotional inhibitory control at anxious stimuli between <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> and non-addicted controls were detected by means of the AGN. In summary, the virtually concretized avatar might replace the rather abstract ideal in IGD as a construct to identify with. The need for such a construct might arise from the urge to compensate dissatisfaction with the own person as a facet of self-concept deficits. The MTG and STG have previously been associated with the retrieval of words or expressions during communication, social perception and emotion regulation (based on a study in social anxiety disorder). The present finding of these regions’ hypoactivation in relation to socially anxious stimuli might indicate that 1) socially anxious words are less retrievable from the semantic storage of <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> than positive, negative or neutral words, 2) in IGD, emotional inhibitory control in the socially anxious context is represented by brain regions involved in the processing of social information (such as the MTG and STG) and that 3) <b>internet</b> gaming <b>addicts</b> have deficiencies in the cognitive regulation of emotions as well as in the processing of social information, with the MTG and STG hypoactivation during socially anxious word blocks possibly serving as a neurobiological correlate of IGD-related social and emotional competence deficits as facets of self-concept impairments...|$|R
