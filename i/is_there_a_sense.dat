6000|$|A {{question}} of immense importance meets us in ethical inquiries, as [...] follows: <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which it}} is needful, right, and [...] praiseworthy, that man should be much habituated to look back upon [...] himself and keep his eye upon himself; a self-regard, and even a [...] self-respect, which are compatible with the self-renunciation and [...] self-distrust which belong to Christianity? In the observance of a [...] single distinction we shall find, perhaps, a secure and sufficient [...] answer. We are to respect our responsibilities, not ourselves. We [...] are to respect the duties of which we are capable, but not our [...] capabilities simply considered. There is to be no complacent [...] self-contemplation, beruminating upon self. When self is viewed, it [...] must always be in the most intimate connection with its purposes. [...] How well were it if persons would be more careful, or rather, more [...] conscientious, in paying compliments. How often do we delude [...] another, in subject matter small or great, into the belief that he [...] has done well what we know he has done ill, either by silence, or [...] by so giving him praise on a particular point as to imply [...] approbation of the whole. Now it is undoubtedly difficult to [...] observe politeness in all cases compatibly with truth; and [...] politeness though a minor duty is a duty still. (1838.) ...|$|E

What is ironic about this meeting is the fact the reader is aware that George’s car remains unpaid for (mirroring all the money which the narrator is still waiting for from his family, they remain in debt just like George). Despite this the narrator tells George to drive the car {{as fast as he}} can. Not only <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of letting go (driving the car fast) but {{there is a sense of}} freedom now within the narrator.

The role of academics and intellectuals in this context is the particular focus of this forum. Questions of agency, subjectivity and activism more broadly are raised, but the specific location of the international relations scholar needs to be considered too. Are scholars inevitably already politically located, as everyone is, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> in which they have a particular responsibility to discharge? How might one begin to imagine a different, perhaps oppositional, form of engagement, and what can this lead to in practice? Contributions engage with questions of normative consciousness, the specificity of cosmopolitanism and its disregard of the postcolonial experience, and forms of activism and contestation that exist already, as well as considering in more theoretical terms what possibilities for a different and more thoroughly ethico-political mode of engagement there might be.

40|$|To be a 'commonsense realist' is to {{hold that}} perceptual {{experience}} is (in general) an immediate awareness of mind-independent objects, {{and a source of}} direct knowledge of what such objects are like. Over the past few centuries this view has faced formidable challenges from epistemology, metaphysics, and, more recently, cognitive science. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in it, due to new work on perceptual consciousness, objectivity, and causal understanding. This volume collects nineteen original essays by leading philosophers and psychologists on these topics. Questions addressed include: What are the commitments of commonsense realism? Does it entail any particular view of the nature of perceptual experience, or any particular view of the epistemology of perceptual knowledge? Should we think of commonsense realism as a view held by some philosophers, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> in which we are pre-theoretically committed to commonsense realism in virtue of the experience we enjoy or the concepts we use or the explanations we give? Is commonsense realism defensible, and if so how, {{in the face of the}} formidable criticism it faces? Specific issues addressed in the philosophical essays include the status of causal requirements on perception, the causal role of perceptual experience, and the relation between objective perception and causal thinking. The scientific essays present a range of perspectives on the development, phylogenetic and ontogenetic, of the human adult conception of perception...|$|E

40|$|A gambler {{walks into}} a {{hypothetical}} fair casino with a very real dollar bill, {{but by the time}} he leaves he's exchanged the dollar for a random amount of money. What is lost in the process? It may be that the gambler walks out at the end of the day, after a roller-coaster ride of winning and losing, with his dollar still intact, or maybe even with two dollars. But what the gambler loses the moment he places his first bet is position. He exchanges one distribution of money for a distribution of lesser quality, from which he cannot return. Our first discussion in this work connects known results of economic inequality and majorization to the probability theory of gambling and Martingales. We provide a simple proof that fair gambles cannot increase the Lorenz curve, and we also constructively demonstrate that any sequence of non-increasing Lorenz curves corresponds to at least one Martingale. We next consider the efficiency of gambles. If all fair gambles are available then one can move down the lattice of distributions defined by the Lorenz ordering. However, the step from one distribution to the next is not unique. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of efficiency with which one can move down the Lorenz stream? One approach would be to minimize the average total volume of money placed on the table. In this case, it turns out that implementing part of the strategy using private randomness can help reduce the need for the casino's randomness, resulting in less money on the table that the casino cannot get its hands on.

40|$|Communicative {{complexity}} {{is a key}} behavioural {{and ecological}} indicator {{in the study of}} animal cognition. Much attention has been given to measures such as repertoire size and syntactic structure in both bird and mammal vocalizations, as large repertoires and complex call combinations may give an indication of the cognitive abilities both of the sender and receiver. However, many animals communicate using a continuous vocal signal that does not easily lend itself to be described by concepts such as ‘repertoire’. For example, dolphin whistles and wolf howls both have complex patterns of frequency modulation, so that no two howls or whistles are quite the same. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> in which some of these vocalizations may be more ‘complex’ than others? Can we arrive at a quantitative metric for complexity in a continuously varying signal? Such a metric would allow us to extend familiar analyses of communicative complexity to those species where vocal behaviour is not restricted to sequences of stereotyped syllables. We present four measures of complexity in continuous signals (Wiener Entropy, Autocorrelation, Inflection Point Count, and Parsons Entropy), and examine their relevance using example data from members of the genus Canis. We show that each metric can lead to different conclusions regarding which howls could be considered complex or not. Ultimately, complexity is poorly defined and researchers must compare metrics to ensure that they reflect the properties for which the hypothesis is being tested.
