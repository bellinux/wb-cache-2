5|$|Despite its {{popularity}} {{and the success}} of Azumanga Daioh, no plans have been announced for an anime adaptation of Yotsuba&!. In an entry posted on his website on 15 May 2005, Azuma said there were no plans <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> animated; he reiterated this on the 5 December 2008, claiming that the stories and style of Yotsuba&! are not well-suited for animation.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E

5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard {{claimed that}} divine omnipotence cannot be {{separated}} from divine goodness. As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because [...] "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> truly free." [...] Alvin Plantinga's [...] "free will defense" [...] is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and evil are consistent.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by regular service, but instead {{to be used for}} non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

Current plans do not call <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by regular service, but instead {{to be used for}} non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot.

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade {{was due to the}} system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E

5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series.

Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show.

In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises.
