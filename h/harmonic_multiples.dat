40|$|Several {{issues related}} to the {{practical}} synthesis of ternary sequences with specified spectra are addressed in this paper. Specifically, sequences with <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> of two and three suppressed are studied, given their relevance to system identification applications. In particular, the effect of non-uniform Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) levels on the spectral properties of the generated signal is analyzed. It is analytically shown that the DAC non-uniform levels result in degraded harmonic suppression performance. Moreover, a new approach is proposed for designing ternary sequences, which is flexible and can be adapted to suit different requirements. The resulting sequences, denoted as randomized constrained sequences, are compared to direct sequences already proposed in the literature. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and experimental results, showing the potential to achieve harmonic suppression performance of approximately 100 dB. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{pseudorandom}} maximum length (PRML) signals for linear identification {{in the presence}} of nonlinear distortions is considered. For this application, it is advantageous for the signal to have <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> of two and three suppressed, in order to minimize the effect of nonlinearity, thus resulting in a better estimate of the underlying linear dynamics. Such signals may be designed through exhaustive search for the sequence-to-signal conversions. However, for signals generated from Galois fields GF(q) with q large, this method is computationally inefficient. An alternative technique is proposed where a primitive version of the signal, the period of which is considerably shorter than that of the required PRML signal, is first generated as a computer-optimized signal. The primitive signal is then used to define the conversions for the generation of the required PRML signal, which is a member of a new class of hybrid signal...|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{designing}} {{two types of}} periodic ternary input signal used to identify a system {{in the presence of}} both noise and nonlinear distortions have been described here. Signals of the first type have even harmonics suppressed, to eliminate errors in odd-order estimates from even-order distortions, and vice-versa. Signals of the second type have <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> of both two and three suppressed, to further reduce errors from nonlinear distortions. For both types of signal, three design criteria are defined. The first criterion allows the signal energy-amplitude ratio to be maximised, the second allows the signal spectrum uniformity to be maximised and the third allows a compromise to be made between the first two criteria. With the methods described, ternary signals of both types with a very wide range of periods can be obtained for use in this application. Software for computer-aided design of the signals is available on the internet. The signals and their periods are given in tables, and an example is used to show how they are applied. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytical}} method to directly synthesise pseudo-random ternary perturbation signals for {{the identification of}} frequency response functions, through the multiplication of two components signals which satisfy a prescribed set of properties. The ternary signals generated have <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> of two and three suppressed; this specification is useful for reducing the effects of nonlinear distortion on the linear estimate. The signals have uniform magnitude in all, except two, of the nonzero harmonics. The method is significant in overcoming the existing problem of sparsity in the available periods when analytical methods are used, {{as well as the}} relatively long computational time required in approaches based on exhaustive search or computer optimisation. The proposed technique presents a breakthrough as it eliminates the sequence-to-signal conversion stage required in the existing conventional methods. A direct consequence is the increased signal power within amplitude constraints, which now equals the theoretical limit for the specification considered. If it is necessary to further increase the number of available periods, the mathematical derivation can be extended to a class of suboptimal direct synthesis signals; however, these possess reduced signal power compared with direct synthesis signals.

40|$|Basic quality {{requirements}} in machining of CFRP components, besides the geometric precision, are thermally undamaged and delamination-free cutting surfaces and edges. Machining of large CFRP structures implies {{a high risk}} of component recovery cost and time, since machining operations are late within the production process chain of those components. Moreover, machinery for processing large CFRP structures is very expensive. These reasons substantiate the need for online-monitored reliable high-productivity CFRP machining capable of preventing rework and waste. Existing process monitoring and control systems developed for metal machining are not suitable for CFRP because the material-specific machinability in terms of tool wear, forces and surface quality call for different detection mechanisms. Accordingly, this study is dedicated to experimental investigations of CFRP machining in order to determine suitable signals and sensors for online monitoring of the relevant tool wear and quality parameters. As the edge trimming of large CFRP components is most difficult to control up to now, the study focuses on this operation. Promising first results with regard to preventive monitoring of tool wear and surface temperature were obtained by force and acceleration evaluation. Experimental studies have been performed in CFRP machining in order to establish a basis for online monitoring with focus on edge trimming. The findings can be summarized as follows: - According to the anisotropy of CFRP the cutting force, the surface temperature and the main spindle power as well as the feed drive torque exhibit a periodic variation - Continuously progressing tool wear with feed travel and local cutting edge chipping are related to an increase of the feed or active force in milling - The amplitudes of the feed force and of the acceleration at the spindle head, which correspond to the spindle speed and its first two <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples,</b> indicate a clear difference between new and worn cutters - The maximum surface temperature easily exceeds the temperature limit of epoxy resins and is related to the active force - Automated online detection of delamination remains a challenge...|$|E

Chapter 1 introduces the physics of cyclotron resonance in metals and the concepts behind effective mass renormalisation in Fermi Liquid theory. Chapter 2 provides a description of millimetre-wave experimental techniques. Resonant cavity techniques {{have made it possible}} to measure the bulk conductivity of anisotropic metallic systems at GHz frequencies. Design details of novel millimetre-wave instruments developed to enable the rotation of a sample in an external magnetic field (i. e. angle-dependence studies) are also provided. Chapter 3 discusses the origin of cyclotron resonance harmonics measured in the high-frequency conductivity of anisotropic metallic systems. These concepts serve as a basis for the interpretation of magneto-optical conductivity measurements in Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4. Chapter 4 presents an angle-dependent study of cyclotron resonance features in the normal state of Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4. A series of harmonic resonance features in the conductivity is observed at odd (n = 3, 5, 7, 9) <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> of the cyclotron resonance frequency. The features originate from the #gamma# Fermi surface and the cyclotron mass is m_c_r_#gamma# = 12. 35 m_e. In addition, several resonance branches are found, which arise from the complicated nature of the band dispersion in this metal. In Chapter 5, a resonant absorption of microwaves is observed in the superconducting state of #kappa#-(BEDT-TTF) _ 2 Cu(NCS) _ 2 and interpreted as a Josephson Plasma Resonance. The superconducting to normal transition is studied as a function of temperature and provides information about the temperature dependence of the upper critical field in #kappa#-(BEDT-TTF) _ 2 Cu(NCS) _ 2. Chapter 6 presents measurements of electron paramagnetic resonance in the quasi-two dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet Cs_ 2 CuCl_ 4. The evolution of the magnetic resonance absorption between the high temperature region (the paramagnetic regime) and temperatures below T_N (the antiferromagnetic regime), is studied for a range of crystal orientations. At temperatures considerably higher than T_N, the magneto-optical data show the onset of short-range spin correlations.

40|$|Gas lift is an {{artificial}} lift technique used in reservoirs with an inadequate pressure. The main {{idea behind the}} gas lift technique is to inject gas with low density into the production pipe so that the fluid mixture becomes lighter. By doing this, a higher production rate can be obtained. However, this also introduces high-pressure combustible gas into the annulus, which again constitutes a major safety risk. In relation to this, acoustic surveys {{can be used to}} either verify barrier integrity or reveal any potential weaknesses in the barriers. Since the operation is carried out from the surface, this reduces the overall risk since {{there is no need for}} well intervention. Additionally, the operation can be performed multiple times which allows for monitoring the current state of the well. In this thesis, a mathematical explanation on pressure wave propagation is provided. When an acoustic survey is performed, a pressure pulse is introduced into the well by utilizing a differential pressure between the well and the chamber on the acoustic equipment which contains atmospheric pressure. The introduced pressure pulse will result in reflected waves whenever it reaches a discontinuity in form of a cross sectional area change or a sudden change in density between two media. These waves will then travel in the opposite direction and get recorded by the microphone on the surface. The dynamics of wave propagation causes the reflected waves to be either positive or negative in magnitude. The latter is exploited when analyzing the acoustic signal afterwards by looking in the well barrier schematic and link the corresponding reflections and elements together. The positive and negative pressure waves are referred to as upkicks and downkicks in this thesis. An upkick means a reflected wave propagating with a higher pressure than the ambient pressure whilst a downkick means a reflected pressure wave propagating with a lower pressure than the ambient pressure. A frequency analysis is also performed on the acoustic signals from wells with an annular safety valve installed. A representation where the frequency domain is combined with the time domain is suggested and the method is used to analyze shots containing strong reflections. The active frequencies are linked together with the physical layout of the well and a thorough explanation is provided. The problem regarding resonance frequencies and strong <b>harmonic</b> <b>multiples</b> is also addressed and a proposal on how these can be attenuated is presented. Furthermore, a small scale version of a gas lift well is designed and a detailed description on how this can be related to a real sized gas lift well is given. Different scenarios are investigated, and the goal is to address the challenges operators face on a daily basis. The results serves as a good overview on how different factors affect the acoustic signal and they can also help to get a better understanding on the acoustic principle. </p...|$|E
