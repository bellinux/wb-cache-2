40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{coexistence}} of multiple periodic solutions for an analogue of the integrate-and-fire neuron model of two-neuron recurrent inhibitory loops with delayed feedback, which incorporates the firing process and absolute refractory period. Upon receiving an excitatory {{signal from the}} excitatory neuron, the inhibitory neuron emits a spike with a pattern-related delay, {{in addition to the}} synaptic delay. We present a theoretical framework to view the inhibitory signal from the inhibitory neuron as a self-feedback of the excitatory neuron with this additional delay. Our analysis shows that the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>feedbacks</b> with firing and the absolute refractory period can generate four basic types of oscillations, and the complicated interaction among these basic oscilla-tions leads to a large class of periodic patterns and the occurrence of multistability in the recurrent inhibitory loop. We also introduce the average time of convergence to a periodic pattern to deter-mine which periodic patterns have the potential to be used for neural information transmission and cognition processing in the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background When humans perform rhythmic {{upper and}} lower limb locomotor-like movements, there is an {{excitatory}} effect of upper limb exertion on lower limb muscle recruitment. To investigate potential neural mechanisms for this behavioral observation, we developed computer simulations modeling interlimb neural pathways among central pattern generators. We hypothesized that enhancement of muscle recruitment from interlimb spinal mechanisms was not sufficient to explain muscle enhancement levels observed in experimental data. Methods We used Matsuoka oscillators for the central pattern generators (CPG) and determined parameters that enhanced amplitudes of rhythmic steady state bursts. Potential mechanisms for output enhancement were excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> gains, excitatory and inhibitory interlimb coupling gains, and coupling geometry. We first simulated the simplest case, a single CPG, and then expanded the model to have two CPGs and lastly four CPGs. In the two and four CPG models, the lower limb CPGs did not receive supraspinal input such that the only mechanisms available for enhancing output were interlimb coupling gains and sensory feedback gains. Results In a two-CPG model with <b>inhibitory</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> gains, only excitatory gains of ipsilateral flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling produced reciprocal upper-lower limb bursts and enhanced output up to 26 %. In a two-CPG model with excitatory sensory feedback gains, excitatory gains of contralateral flexor-flexor/extensor-extensor coupling produced reciprocal upper-lower limb bursts and enhanced output up to 100 %. However, within a given excitatory sensory feedback gain, enhancement due to excitatory interlimb gains could only reach levels up to 20 %. Interconnecting four CPGs to have ipsilateral flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling, contralateral flexor-flexor/extensor-extensor coupling, and bilateral flexor-extensor/extensor-flexor coupling could enhance motor output up to 32 %. Enhancement observed in experimental data exceeded 32 %. Enhancement within this symmetrical four-CPG neural architecture was more sensitive to relatively small interlimb coupling gains. Excitatory sensory feedback gains could produce greater output amplitudes, but larger gains were required for entrainment compared to <b>inhibitory</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> gains. Conclusions Based on these simulations, symmetrical interlimb coupling can account for much, {{but not all of}} the excitatory neural coupling between {{upper and lower}} limbs during rhythmic locomotor-like movements. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a neural {{mass model}} is {{proposed}} to analyze some mechanisms underlying {{the generation of}} fast oscillations (80 Hz and beyond) {{at the onset of}} seizures. This model includes one sub-population of pyramidal cells and one sub-population of interneurons targeting the perisomatic region of pyramidal cells where fast GABAergic currents are mediated. We identified some conditions for which the model can reproduce the features of high-frequency, chirp-like (from approximately 100 to approximately 70 Hz) signatures observed in real depth-EEG signals recorded in epileptic patients at seizure onset ("fast onset activity"). These conditions included appropriate alterations in (i) the strengths of GABAergic and glutamatergic connections, and (ii) the amplitude of average EPSPs/IPSPs. Results revealed that a subtle balance between excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>feedbacks</b> is required in the model for reproducing a 'realistic' fast activity, i. e., showing a reduction of frequency with a simultaneous increase in amplitude, as actually observed in epileptogenic cerebral cortex. Results also demonstrated that the number of scenarios (variation, in time, of model parameters) leading to chirp-like signatures was rather limited. First, to produce high-frequency output signals, the model should operate in a "resonance" region, at the frontier between a stable and an unstable region. Second both EPSP and IPSP amplitudes should decrease with time in order to obey the frequency/amplitude constraint. These scenarios obtained through a mathematical analysis of the model show how some alteration in the structure of neural networks can lead to dysfunction. They also provide insights into potentially important mechanisms for high-frequency epileptic activity generation...|$|R

40|$|Neurons must {{faithfully}} encode {{signals that}} can vary over many {{orders of magnitude}} despite having only limited dynamic ranges. For a correlated signal, this dynamic range con-straint can be relieved by subtracting away components of the signal that can be predicted from the past, a strategy known as predictive coding, that relies on learning the input statis-tics. However, the statistics of input natural signals can also vary over very short time scales e. g., following saccades across a visual scene. To maintain a reduced transmission cost to signals with rapidly varying statistics, neuronal circuits implementing predictive coding must also rapidly adapt their properties. Experimentally, in different sensory modalities, sensory neurons have shown such adaptations within 100 ms of an input change. Here, we show first that linear neurons connected in a <b>feedback</b> <b>inhibitory</b> circuit can implement predictive coding.

Yet {{the effects of}} delayed feedback on sensory processing of natural signals are poorly understood. This study explores the consequences of delayed excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>feedback</b> inputs on the processing of sensory information. We show, through numerical simulations and theory, that excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>feedback</b> can alter the firing frequency response of stochastic neurons in opposite ways by creating dynamical resonances, which in turn lead to information resonances (i. e., increased information transfer for specific ranges of input frequencies). The resonances are created {{at the expense of}} decreased information transfer in other frequency ranges. Using linear response theory for stochastically firing neurons, we explain how feedback signals shape the neural transfer function for a single neuron as a function of network size. We also find that balanced excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>feedback</b> can further enhance information tuning while maintaining a constant mean firing rate. Finally, we apply this theory to in vivo experimental data from weakly electric fish in which the feedback loop can be opened.
