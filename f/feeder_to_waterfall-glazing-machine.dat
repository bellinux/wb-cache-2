40|$|Abstract: In this Project the Power Quality {{improvement}} {{is done for}} elimination of Sag, Swell and Harmonics for two feeder distribution system by using Multi Converter UPQC. In this system two series voltage source converters and one shunt voltage source converter exits. The system can be applied <b>to</b> adjacent <b>feeder</b> <b>to</b> compensate for supply voltage and load current imperfections on the main feeder and full compensation of supply voltage imperfections on the other feeder. In this configuration all converters are connected back to back on the dc side and share common dc-link capacitor. Hence, Power can be transferred from one <b>feeder</b> <b>to</b> adjacent <b>feeder</b> <b>to</b> compensate Sag, Swell and Interruption. The performance of two feeder distribution system is studied using MATLAB / SIMULINK...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{entities}} {{that need to be}} taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure.

Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the <b>feeder</b> <b>to</b> the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the <b>feeder</b> ready <b>to</b> be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.|$|R
