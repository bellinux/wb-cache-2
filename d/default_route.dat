25|$|A stub area is an {{area which}} does not receive route {{advertisements}} external to the autonomous system (AS) and routing from within the area is based entirely on a <b>default</b> <b>route.</b> An ABR deletes type 4, 5 LSAs from internal routers, sends them a <b>default</b> <b>route</b> of 0.0.0.0 and turns itself into a default gateway. This reduces LSDB and routing table size for internal routers.|$|E

Routing protocols {{need to deal}} with topology changes while keeping the routing overhead low, especially the number of broadcasts, to save energy. In this paper, we {{consider the}} problem of building and adapting <b>default</b> <b>routes</b> for convergecast and host routes for downward traffic. We first propose a local repair scheme that allows arbitrarily long periods for rebuilding the tree/DODAG of <b>default</b> <b>routes.</b> Second, we design a scheme for preventing packet forwarding along routing loops, which may occur in the combination of broken host <b>routes</b> and <b>default</b> <b>routes.</b> We achieve this goal without adding an additional header to packets. The two schemes along with on-demand host route construction provides a complete routing solution that addresses many of the shortcomings of RPL. We validate the proposed schemes with Cooja emulations and an experimental evaluation on a real-world sensor network testbed...|$|R

25|$|Internet service {{providers}} establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks {{at various levels}} of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent {{the bottom of the}} routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's national research and education network, JANET. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of scale-free networks. Computers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to the next-hop router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols. End-nodes typically use a <b>default</b> <b>route</b> that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.|$|E

This requirement {{comes from the fact}} that outbound packets (for example, a TCP SYNACK) as responses to inbound packets (for example, a TCP SYN) coming in through a PCP mapping as already rewritten by a NAT device or firewall, must also go back the same way so appropriate inverse packet rewritting can be performed. If there was no such restriction, simultaneous creation of PCP mappings would be required on all network gateways, which might not be consistently doable; for example, on one of the default gateways the required external port might be already taken by another application's mapping.|$|R
40|$|Initially, packet {{forwarding}} in the Internet was destination-based – that is, {{a router}} would forward all packets {{with the same}} destination address to the same next hop. In this paper, we use active probing methods to quantify and characterize deviations from destination-based forwarding in today’s Internet. From over a quarter million probes, we analyze the forwarding behavior of almost 40, 000 in-termediate routers. We find that, for 29 % of the targeted routers, the router forwards traffic going to a single destination via different next hops, and 1. 3 % of the routers even select next hops in differ-ent ASes. Load balancers are unlikely to explain these AS-level variations, and in fact we uncover causes including routers inside MPLS tunnels that otherwise employ <b>default</b> <b>routes.</b> We also find that these violations can significantly affect the results of measure-ment tools that rely on destination-based forwarding, and we dis-cuss some ideas for making these tools more robust against these violations...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{construct}} routing overlay networks {{using the following}} principle: that overlay edges {{should be based on}} mutual advantage between pairs of hosts. Upon this principle, we design, implement, and evaluate Peer-Wise, a latency-reducing overlay network. To show the feasibility of PeerWise, we must show first that mutual advantage exists in the Internet: perhaps contrary to expectation, that there are not only “haves ” and “have nots” of low-latency connectivity. Second, we must provide a scalable means of finding promising edges and overlay routes; we seek embedding error in network coordinates to expose both shorter-than-default “detour ” <b>routes</b> and longer-than-expected <b>default</b> <b>routes.</b> We evaluate the cost of limiting PeerWise to mutually advantageous links, then build the intelligent components that put PeerWise into practice. We design and evaluate “virtual ” network coordinates for destinations not participating in the overlay, neighbor selection algorithms to find promising relays, and relay selection algorithms to choose the neighbor to traverse for a good detour. Finally, we show that PeerWise is practical through a wide-area deployment and evaluation. ...|$|R

40|$|The Internet {{consists}} {{of thousands of}} independent domains with different, and sometimes competing, business interests. However, the current interdomain routing protocol (BGP) limits each router to using a single route for each destination prefix, which may not satisfy the diverse requirements of end users. Recent proposals for source routing offer an alternative where end hosts or edge routers select the end-to-end paths. However, source routing leaves transit domains with very little control and introduces difficult scalability and security challenges. In this dissertation, a multi-path interdomain routing protocol called MIRO is presented, it offers substantial flexibility while giving transit domains control over the flow of traffic through their infrastructure and avoiding state explosion in disseminating reachability information. In MIRO, routers learn <b>default</b> <b>routes</b> through the existing BGP protocol, and arbitrary pairs of domains can negotiate the use of additional paths (bound to tunnels in the data plane) tailored to their special needs. It retains {{the simplicity of the}} BGP protocol for most traffic, and remains backward compatible with BGP to allow for incremental deployability.

40|$|SDN {{approaches}} to inter-domain routing promise better traffic engineering, enhanced security, and higher automation. Yet, naïve deployment of SDN on the Internet is dangerous as the control-plane expressiveness of BGP is significantly more limited than the data-plane expressiveness of SDN, which allows fine-grained rules to deflect traffic from BGP's <b>default</b> <b>routes.</b> This mismatch {{may lead to}} incorrect forwarding behaviors such as forwarding loops and blackholes, ultimately hindering SDN deployment at the inter-domain level. In this work, we make a first step towards verifying the correctness of inter-domain forwarding state {{with a focus on}} loop freedom while keeping private the SDN rules, as they comprise confidential routing information. To this end, we design a simple yet powerful primitive that allows two networks to verify whether their SDN rules overlap, i. e., the set of packets matched by these rules is non-empty, without leaking any information about the SDN rules. We propose an efficient implementation of this primitive by using recent advancements in Secure Multi-Party Computation and we then leverage it as the main building block for designing a system that detects Internet-wide forwarding loops among any set of SDN-enabled Internet eXchange Points...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To debug {{reachability}} problems, {{a network}} operator often asks operators of other networks for help by telephone or email. We present a new protocol, COVE, for automating {{the exchange of}} data plane reachability information between networks in a business relationship. A network deploys COVE in a host (its local verifier) which can construct both forward and reverse reachability trees in the Internet data plane for the network’s provider/customer cone. Each edge in a tree is annotated {{by a set of}} packets that can traverse the edge. COVE was designed with partial deployment in mind. Reachable networks that do not deploy COVE are leaf nodes in reachability trees. Partial trees are useful. We constructed an Internet dataset of 2, 649 ASes and per-formed experiments in which up to 170 workstations ran COVE as local verifiers to construct forward and reverse provider (also customer) trees for ASes. The results of these experiments demonstrate scalability of COVE to very large ASes in the Internet. We illustrate applications of COVE to solve the fol-lowing network management problems: evaluating inbound load balancing policies, what-if analysis before adding a new provider, finding additional paths, configuring <b>default</b> <b>routes</b> as backup, black hole detection, and persistent forwarding loop detection.

40|$|Abstract—Existing routing {{protocols}} for sensor networks either exclusively focus on collection-based traffic, or optimize for point-to-point traffic in a homogeneous network. As these networks become more general, {{a mix of}} these workloads in a heterogeneous setting is expected, while still abiding by the resource constraints of low-power and lossy networks (L 2 Ns). Our design leverages the predominantly two-tiered topology of L 2 N deployments, with capable border routers supplementing resource-starved in-network nodes, and optimizes for the typical traffic workloads consisting mainly of collection based traffic with specific instances of point-to-point traffic. We present Hydro, a hybrid routing protocol that combines local agility with centralized control. In-network nodes use distributed DAG formation to provide <b>default</b> <b>routes</b> to border routers, concurrently forming the foundation for triangle pointto-point routing. Border Routers build a global, but typically incomplete, view of the network using topology reports received from in-network nodes, and subsequently install optimized routes in the network for active point-to-point flows. Building on the vast existing literature on distributed DAG formation in L 2 Ns and centralized routing in large-scale networks, our contribution lies in the merging of these ideas {{in the form of}} a routing protocol that addresses the needs of L 2 Ns while remaining grounded in their inherent constraints. Evaluations across testbeds and deployments demonstrate the performance and functionality of Hydro across a variety of workloads and network conditions. I...|$|R
