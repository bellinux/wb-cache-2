The present study investigated various measurement issues related to male and female body image, with a particular focus on the former, which has historically received relatively little empirical attention. To address the four primary objectives of the present investigation, 154 male and 122 female introductory psychology students were administered various body image instruments. Results suggest that assessing both body fatness and muscularity provides a more comprehensive assessment of male body image than assessing only a single dimension, the latter of which has traditionally been done with males. Also, males appear to be more dissatisfied with their bodies than has historically been reported. Specifically, they selected ideal bodies that were markedly more muscular and less fat than they perceived themselves to be. For both males and females, there were no significant order effects, i. e., responses did not differ depending on the order in which the body image questions (current, ideal, attractive) were asked. Also, the importance attributed to attainment of the identified ideal body did not moderate the relationship between the current-ideal discrepancy and affective body satisfaction, for either males or females. The attitudes towards muscularity held by the males did not aid the prediction of affective body satisfaction. Lastly, the collected male and female behavioral data provide useful clues as to where to look for possible predictors (e. g., ideal muscularity, affective body satisfaction, etc.) of potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>diet</b> and exercise behaviors (e. g., pro-hormone use, fasting, etc.) ...|$|E

Daily as well as seasonal, dietary and lifestyle recommendations has been described to promote health. <b>Harmful</b> <b>diets</b> and activities have been identified to prevent diseases. Against this background a cross sectional {{study was conducted with}} the purpose to assess awareness and knowledge of dietary and life style interventions prescribed by Ayurveda among the students of Panjab University. Study tool used was a questionnaire containing 30 questions. 150 students were surveyed in campus of Panjab University. Statistical analysis was done by using the SPSS. Results revealed that knowledge about Ayurvedic dietary and lifestyle recommendations significantly depends upon stream of study and background of students. Many respondents assumed mentioned practices as true but few were aware that these are recommended by Ayurveda. Ayurveda is science of life and focuses on preventive approach. There is strong need to promote Ayurveda as a system of medicine as well as health...|$|R

Future directions and conclusing remarks [...] References. Research {{has shown that}} anorexia nervosa patients represent their bodies in a distorted manner, as larger than reality. This distortion is seen in three kinds of body representations: the body percept (the mental image we have of our bodies), the body schema (used for motor control and simulation) and a representation I call the tactile form (used for certain kinds of tactile perception). In this thesis I fit this evidence into a broader framework for understanding how the spatial content {{of the body is}} tracked and stored. I do so by first discussing O’Shaughnessy’s (1980) long-term body image hypothesis. This hypothesis posits a representation that tracks changes in the spatial content of the body and supplies this content to other body representations. I argue that a similar kind of body representation might exist, supplying spatial content to the body percept, body schema and tactile form. I then explain the evidence of distortion in patients’ body representations by suggesting it arises in in this long-term representation. I also discuss what role this distortion plays in maintaining the disease. I suggest that body percept and body schema distortion causes patients to have oversized experiences of their bodies. Along with socio-cultural influences, these oversized experiences help ground patients’ propositional attitudes about their own body size. These propositional attitudes, in turn, motivate <b>harmful</b> <b>dieting</b> behaviour. As such, I show that distorted body representations {{play an important role in}} maintaining the disease.

50|$|The {{grapefruit}} diet, {{also known}} as the Hollywood Diet is a short-term fad diet that has existed in the United States since at least the 1930s. The diet is based on the claim that grapefruit has a fat-burning enzyme or similar property. The variations of the grapefruit diet that are too low in calories (below 800-1000 calories a day), too low in carbohydrates, or too low in essential micronutrients are considered unhealthy and potentially dangerous. While eating half a grapefruit with every meal may {{be a good way to}} incorporate more fruit in the diet of a healthy person, grapefruit and grapefruit juice is <b>harmful</b> if the <b>dieter</b> is taking medicines that can interact with grapefruit juice or is allergic to citruses. This diet will not be beneficial to anyone over a long time as the extremely low calorie intake could lead to malnutrition and many health problems. The grapefruit diet also does not require exercise.|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic Reviews, Randomized (RCTs), and Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs) were identified through an electronic search of four databases complemented by manual search. Identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment of the included publications was performed according to the AMSTAR tool for the assessment of the methodological quality of systematic reviews. RESULTS A total of seven systematic reviews were included. With the exception of inadequate oral hygiene, the following unhealthy lifestyles related with periodontal diseases were investigated: tobacco use, unhealthy <b>diets,</b> <b>harmful</b> use of alcohol, physical inactivity, and stress. Brief interventions for TUC were shown to be effective when applied in the dental practice setting while evidence for dietary counselling and the promotion of other healthy lifestyles was limited or non-existent. CONCLUSIONS While aiming to improve periodontal treatment outcomes and the maintenance of periodontal health current evidence suggests that tobacco use brief interventions conducted in the dental practice setting were effective thus underlining the rational for behavioural support...|$|R

Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to test some hypotheses of the risk factors for undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT) in the low incidence population. Methods. A case-control study was used for the research. The study included 45 cases with histopathological diagnosis of UCNT and 90 controls. Cases and the controls were individually matched by sex, age (± 3 years), and place of residence (city-village). Data were gathered about sociodemographic characteristics, occupational exposure to <b>harmful</b> agents, habits, <b>diet,</b> personal history, and family history. In the analysis of the data, conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied. Results. According to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis UCNT was significantly positively associated with 'passive smoking' of tobacco in the family during childhood, frequent consumption of industrially manufactured food additives for enhancing flavour and frequent consumption of white bread. UCNT was significantly negatively associated with frequent consumption of margarine, olive oil and cornbread. Conclusion. In our low incidence population, an independent risk factor for the occurrence of UCNT was 'passive smoking' of tobacco in the family during childhood, use of industrially manufactured food with additives for enhancing flavour and consumption of white bread. Multicentric study enrolling a greater number of cases would be desirable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} an omega- 3 (n- 3) fatty acid enriched diet alone and in {{combination}} with gamma irradiation (IR) therapy in nude mice bearing a human MDA-MB 231 breast cancer xenograft were tested. The cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of young female mice. Six weeks later, mice were randomly divided into two diet groups: 1) mice with 10 % corn oil (rich in omega 6 fatty acids) in their food, 2) mice consuming a 10 % fat diet that was enriched in n- 3 fatty acids. After two weeks on the diet, treatment with 200 cGy of IR every second day for four treatments (total 800 cGy) was initiated on half of the mice from each diet group. Some mice {{in each of the}} 4 groups were euthanized 24 hours after the end of IR while the remaining mice were followed for 3 additional weeks. Tumor sections were stained for endothelial cells with CD 31 and PAS and for hypoxia inducible factor 1 α (HIF-α). Results The tumor cortex within 100 microns of the well-vascularized capsule had little vascularization. Blood vessels, capillaries, and endothelial pseudopods were found at areas greater than 100 microns from the capsule (subcortex). Mice on the corn oil diet and treated with IR 24 hours previously or non-irradiated mice fed the n- 3 diet had tumors with fewer blood vessels in the subcortex and more endothelial pseudopods projecting into hypoxic (HIF- α positive) areas than did mice from the non-irradiated corn oil fed group. The tumor growth rate of mice that received IR or that were fed the n- 3 fatty acid enriched diet was significantly slower than in the mice fed the 10 % corn oil <b>diet.</b> <b>Harmful</b> side effects were found only in the IR treated mice. Conclusion The omega- 3 fatty acid enriched diet proved to be a safe means for retarding tumor growth and vascularization. </p...|$|R
