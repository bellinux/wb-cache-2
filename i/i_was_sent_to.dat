5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, Indian Territory. This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
25|$|The unarmed E.S.1 {{was sent}} to France for {{operational}} trials at Saint-Omer in France in 1916, where it was criticised for the poor view for the pilot and {{for the fact that}} if the engine was mishandled, petrol could collect in the cowling and catch fire. It was finally badly damaged in a crash when flown by Captain Patrick Playfair. After rebuilding and arming with a synchronised Vickers gun, the modified E.F.1 Mk <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> No. 50 (Home Defence) Squadron.|$|E
25|$|I enquired {{throughout}} Italy at what place {{boys were}} chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan {{that it was}} at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Naples... {{it is said that}} there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' ("Here boys are castrated"); but I was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops during my residence in that city.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so I ran away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, and this time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
2500|$|Handsome Dan was {{selected}} based {{on his ability to}} tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color crimson and to tigers (the symbols of rival schools Harvard and Princeton respectively), and Graves (?) cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events. The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: [...] "He was a big white bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the Westminster Dog Show and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada. According to the Hartford Courant, [...] "In personal appearance, he seemed like a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence {{to the fact that the}} rope held." [...] The Philadelphia Press reported that [...] "a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before." [...] Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan stuffed and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Peabody Museum for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I now is in a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where, according to Stanton Ford, [...] "he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory." [...] Andrew Graves died of tuberculosis on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.|$|E
