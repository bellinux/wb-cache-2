5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

25|$|Since {{many new}} arbitrants {{would have been}} expecting to litigate claims, the {{arbitration}} should be sensitive to that and allow more extensive discovery processes before the hearing, with the steady guidance of an arbitrator to ensure that aspect of the process did not become as time-consuming {{as it had in}} litigation.

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{complications}} in studying hydrogen isotopes {{is the issue of}} exchangeability. At many time scales, ranging from hours to geological epochs, scientists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> if the hydrogen moieties in studied molecules are the original species or if they represent exchange with water or mineral hydrogen near by. Research in this area is still inconclusive in regards to rates of exchange, but it is generally understood that hydrogen exchange complicates the preservation of information in isotope studies.|$|E
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small momenta, a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> both the gluon and the ghost propagators. At large momenta (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the gluon and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero as we will see in the next section.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{determined}} in 2007 that the airport {{would have to}} close {{at the end of}} the 2013 season. The club appealed to Ombudsman for Public Administration, who determined that the ministry would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the issue once more. In 2010 the Food Safety Authority stated that the airport was a threat to the water quality and that water quality was a primary public concern, supporting the closing of the airport from 2013. The concession ended in 2013 and a renewal was finally rejected by the city in August 2013. This time the CAA supported the motion of closure, citing reasons of general public interests. The club has not found a new location for its seaplanes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E

25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario.
