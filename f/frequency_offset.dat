5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} the satellite communications. The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

We propose two new training signal designs for MIMO OFDM frequency-selective channel estimation.

5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

The expanded data values were prompted by Inmarsat's involvement in the search for Air France Flight447, which disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

40|$|The {{application}} of distributed space-time coding schemes in a simulcast network is considered, {{and a key}} challenge is addressed which arises in the downlink: Since the local oscillators employed at the individual transmitting nodes may independently differ from the nominal carrier <b>frequency,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> will occur between the individual transmission signals.

500|$|An {{analysis}} of the time difference between the transmission of the ping and the aircraft's response allowed Inmarsat to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite. This resulted in two arcs—referred to as the [...] "northern corridor" [...] and [...] "southern corridor"—where the aircraft may have been located {{at the time of}} its last complete handshake at 08:11. Using an [...] "innovative technique" [...] that has [...] "never before [...] used in an investigation of this sort", the team determined it could also use the burst <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> to determine the aircraft's speed and position along the identified arcs. Inmarsat cross-checked its methodology to known flight data from six Boeing777 aircraft flying in various directions on the same day, and found a good match. Applying the technique to the handshake signals from Flight370 gave results that correlated strongly with the expected and actual measurements of a southern trajectory over the Indian Ocean, but poorly with a northern trajectory. Further revised calculations to account for movements of the satellite relative to the earth allowed the northern corridor to be ruled out completely. This analysis was passed on to Malaysian authorities on 23March.|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} Flight 370 was {{launched}} in Southeast Asia near {{the location of the}} last verbal and radar contact with air traffic control. The day after the accident, staff at Inmarsat reviewed the log of communications between their network and Flight370 and discovered that Flight370 continued for several hours after contact with air traffic control was lost. On 11March, they provided a preliminary analysis to investigators based on recorded burst timing offset (BTO) values. Relatively simple calculations can be made from BTO values to determine the distance between the aircraft and satellite at each transmission. When these distances are plotted on Earth, they result in rings which are further reduced to arcs, due to the limited range of the aircraft. Another value—burst <b>frequency</b> <b>offset</b> (BFO)—was analysed to determine the movement of the aircraft relative to the satellite, based on the Doppler shift of the signals, which provides the location of the aircraft along the BTO-derived arcs. Initial analysis of the BFO values showed a strong correlation with a track south into the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia. On 24March, Malaysia's Prime Minister cited this analysis to conclude that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean with no survivors. After the initial analysis, the BFO calculations were later adjusted to account for a wobble in the satellite's orbit and thermal changes in the satellite which affected the recorded BFO values. Further analysis considered the BTO and BFO calculations with flight dynamics, such as possible and probable aircraft speeds, altitudes, and autopilot modes. Two statistical analyses were made and combined with calculations of Flight370's maximum range to determine the most probable location of Flight370 {{at the time of the}} 8:19 transmission, which is along the 8:19BTO arc from approximately [...] to [...]|$|E

30|$|In [19], a {{nonuniform}} {{linear array}} is adopted for the FDA. However, the {{transmitter and receiver}} must be placed accurately. Another nonuniform linear array for FDA is attempted to suppress/locate range-dependent interference/target in [12], but the carrier frequency and/or frequency increments cannot be altered in real-time because it requires relocating the elements mechanically. Logarithmically increasing <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> [24] or time-dependent <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> [25] are also suggested to decouple the range-angle beampattern, but they result in poor beamforming performance, especially in the range dimension. In fact, the best decoupling approach is to form a dot-shaped beampattern rather than an “S”-shaped beampattern. Such a dot-shaped range-angle beampattern is synthesized in [26] by a symmetrical FDA using multi-carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> and convex optimization, and in [27] {{by the use of}} random <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets.</b> Nevertheless, these two schemes are very difficult to implement in practical array systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The use of {{distributed}} space-time {{codes in}} cooperative communications promises {{to increase the}} rate and reliability of data transmission. These gains were mostly demonstrated for ideal scenarios, where all the nodes are perfectly synchronized. Considering a cooperative uplink scenario with asynchronous nodes, the system suffers from two effects: timing errors and individual carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets.</b> In effect, timing errors can completely cancel the advantages introduced by space-time codes, while individual carrier <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> provide a great challenge to receivers. Indeed, in cooperative communications, <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> are perceived as a time-variant channel, even if the individual links are static. We show that using OFDM, space-time codes (STCs) become robust to timing errors. Channel estimation and tracking takes care of <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets.</b> Our simulations demonstrate that the bit error rate (BER) performance improves by an order of magnitude, when using a cooperative system design, which takes these two effects into account.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a fully {{distributed}} algorithm for <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> estimation in decentralized systems. The idea {{is based on}} belief propagation, resulting in that each node estimates its own <b>frequency</b> <b>offsets</b> by local computations and limited ex-change of information with its direct neighbors. Such algorithm does not require any centralized information processing or knowl-edge of global network topology, thus is scalable with network size. It is shown analytically that the proposed algorithm always con-verges to the optimal estimates regardless of network topology. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the algo-rithm and show that estimation mean-squared-error at each node approaches the centralized Cramér-Rao bound within a few itera-tions of message exchange.
