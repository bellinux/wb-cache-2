50|$|ICC issued Kirby {{a bill of}} lading, which invoked {{liability}} limitations {{provided by}} the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), {{as well as a}} <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause</b> which extended ICC's limitations of liability to companies ICC hired. ICC hired Hamburg Süd to transport the goods, and Hamburg Süd issued ICC a bill of lading that also invoked COGSA protections and included a <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
50|$|The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled Norfolk Southern could {{limit its}} {{liability}} to Kirby {{on the basis}} of the <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause</b> in the Hamburg Süd contract. As the <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause</b> in the Hamburg Süd bill incorporated COGSA, which specified that liability was limited to $500 per package, and the shipment was packed in ten containers, Norfolk Southern's total liability was therefore $5000. On the joint motion of the parties, the district court certified its order for interlocutory appeal.|$|E
50|$|The Privy Council {{used the}} {{doctrine}} of agency {{to give effect to}} the exemption (<b>Himalaya)</b> <b>clause</b> (thus extending it from the carriers to the stevedores) using the carriers as the agent.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of this decision, specially drafted <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clauses</b> benefiting stevedores and others began {{to be included in}} bills of lading.|$|R
50|$|With the Scruttons case, {{the issue}} of third party rights in a {{contract}} were made certain. There had been much speculation {{on the meaning of}} Elder, Dempster but it became clear that there was no new rule from that case. This case, among others, resulted in the change of practice in shipping contracts by adding <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clauses</b> to protect third parties.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{reversed}} {{and ruled}} the Hamburg Süd bill did not limit Norfolk Southern's liability to Kirby because Kirby was {{not bound by}} its terms. The 11th Circuit observed that previous jurisprudence supported the proposition that <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clauses</b> did not extend to inland carriers {{that had not been}} in privity with ICC when ICC issued the bill.: ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause</b> is a {{contractual}} provision {{expressed to}} be for the benefit of a third party who is not a party to the contract. Although theoretically applicable to any form of contract, most of the jurisprudence relating to Himalaya clauses relate to maritime matters, and exclusion clauses in bills of lading for the benefit of employees, crew, and agents, stevedores in particular.|$|E
5000|$|The ICC bill's broadly written <b>Himalaya</b> <b>Clause</b> limits Norfolk's liability. Since Huntsville, Alabama is some 366 miles km inland {{from the}} {{discharge}} port, the parties must have anticipated using a land carrier's {{services for the}} contract's performance. Because {{it is clear that}} a railroad was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bill's broadly written clause, Norfolk's liability is limited by the clause's terms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{case is not}} {{inherently}} local, {{and there}} is a concern for the uniform meaning of maritime contracts. The same liability limitation in a single bill of lading for international intermodal transportation often applies both to sea and to land, as is true of the Hamburg Süd bill. Likewise, a single <b>Himalaya</b> <b>Clause</b> can cover both sea and land carriers downstream, as in the ICC bill. In protecting the uniformity of federal maritime law, this Court also reinforces the liability regime Congress established in COGSA.|$|E
40|$|Sea {{carriers}} in the past, {{have extended}} liability to their servants, agents and sub-contractors through <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clauses</b> in the bills of lading. However, {{there has been}} a complicated legal debate over third party liability and exemption clauses in the contract of carriage by sea. Complicated issues have made it difficult to determine who bears responsibility for the goods from carriage to delivery. This will affect the introduction of adequate insurance rates, which will in turn, apply to efficient rates of carriage. Some of the difficulties had been overcome by an established principle of vicarious liability. However, this principle was short lived, as it was severely restricted and later, well defunct. The Privy Council decision of A. M. Satterthwaite and Co. Ltd. v New Zealand Shipping Co. Ltd., did successfully transfer indemnity to a third party. However, the High Court decision of Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty. Ltd. v Salmond and Spraggon (Australia) Pty. Ltd. failed to apply the Eurymedon doctrine. Therefore, although the Enrymedon was not over ruled, there was still opposition to third party indemnity under bills of lading. The High Court initiated a search for fine distinctions involving the capacity issue, construction of the agreement, consideration, agency and fundamental breach. The New York Star was appealed to the Privy Council, which reversed the decision of the High Court. The status of third party liability was still somewhat unsettled until the matter was again tested and upheld in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. v Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaf and others, and Sidney Cooke Ltd. v Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaf and Another, decisions. The principles in the House of Lord's decision in the New York Star, which allowed the exclusion of stevedores under a bill of lading, were transferred to the road haulage industry in Celthene Pty. Ltd. v W. K. J. Hauliers Pty. Ltd. and Another, and upheld in Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd. v Frigmobile Pty. Ltd. and Another. It is apparent from these recent decisions, that a properly worded limitation or exclusion clause, can operate to exempt the carrier's servants, agents and independent contractors, from liability for damage or loss of goods. Such an understanding makes it easier for cargo owners to ascertain the risk they undertake when shipping their freight, and to arrange for appropriate insurance coverage. The carrier, knowing that his servants, agents and independent contractors employed from time to time, are exempted from liability, can set competitive rates of carriage, and discard high insurance costs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expansive}} contract language {{corresponds to}} the fact that various modes of transportation would be involved in performing the contract. Kirby and ICC contracted for the transportation of machinery from Australia to Huntsville, Alabama, and, as the crow flies, Huntsville is some 366 miles inland from the port of discharge.... Thus, the parties must have anticipated that a land carrier's services would be necessary for the contract's performance. It is clear to us that a railroad like Norfolk was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bill's broadly written <b>Himalaya</b> <b>Clause.</b> Accordingly, Norfolk's liability is limited by the terms of that clause.|$|E
5000|$|This {{principle}} {{makes sense}} {{in light of}} the origins and purpose of Himalaya clauses. Himalaya clauses originally were aimed more at extending COGSA protections to additional parties who handle cargo in and around a port than at extending the reach of those protections inland. That is why most of our cases concerning Himalaya clauses have involved as the defendants stevedores, terminal operators, and other similar parties whose work is done at or close {{to the point where the}} cargo is unloaded from the ship. We should be cautious about extending the reach of a <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause,</b> and with it the reach of COGSA, inland.|$|E

40|$|In 23 September 2009 the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, shortly the Rotterdam Rules, was signed. Its {{success is}} yet a mystery because only three states have {{ratified}} the Rules. This is mainly {{due to the}} growing liabilities of the carrier side and higher limitation of liability. The new definition maritime performing party has raised questions and criticism, too. The definition of a maritime performing party develops the third party protection to a wider scope than before. This article will enlighten the actual impact of the maritime performing party to the Finnish Maritime Code. How do the Rotterdam Rules change {{the position of a}} non-contractual third party? What changes will the rules on maritime performing party bring to Finnish maritime law as part of the Nordic maritime legislation? There are three existing conventions on carriage of goods by sea. The Hague Rules do not cover the issue of a sub-carrier at all but the Hague-Visby Rules added an article that allows agents and servants of the carrier to enjoy the benefits of the contract of carriage if the shipper claims damages directly from a sub-carrier. The Hamburg Rules took third party protection a bit further by including independent contractors to the sphere of the protection of third parties. The same result can be attained through a so called <b>Himalaya</b> <b>clause</b> that means a contract clause benefitting a third party. The Rotterdam Rules define a maritime performing party as any sub-carrier performing the carrier’s duties in port area or at sea. The definition expands the scope of the sub-carrier’s that can be covered and it would include sea carriers, stevedores, terminal operators, agents, lightering companies, freight forwarders, and all modes of inland carriers when used exclusively in the port area. The Finnish maritime code resembles the Hamburg Rules concerning the protection of third parties; a shipper can bring a direct action against a third party that is protected with the carrier’s defences and limits of liability. Under the Finnish maritime code the third parties can be sea carriers and stevedores. If the Rotterdam Rules were implemented in Finland, the coverage of the maritime code would be clearer and wider...|$|E
