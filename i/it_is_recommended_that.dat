5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 85) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the relationship of a boy's perception of a nurturant father, self-perception, and leadership status among fifth and sixth grade boys in a public, elementary school in Southern California. The subjects randomly selected for this study were 50, fifth and sixth grade males. The Bronfenbrenner Parent Behavior Questionnaire was employed to assess the boy's perception of his relationship with his father or father-figure. The Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory was utilized to obtain a measure of each subject's self-perception. In order to establish the leadership status of each male participant, the Who Are They? Test was administered to both males and females in each of four classrooms involved in the study. The data were analyzed by correlation coefficients and a correlated t-test between perceived paternal nurturance, self-perception, and leadership status. Results showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between perceived paternal nurturance and self-perception and a significant relationship between self-perception and leadership status for fifth and sixth grade boys at the. 05 level. However, no significant relationship was found between leadership status and perceived paternal nurturance. Boys who perceive a nurturing relationship with their fathers and have positive self-concepts may not necessarily be considered leaders among their peers. From the results of this study, the following recommendations <b>were</b> made: (1) <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> cross-cultural studies <b>be</b> conducted, examining the relationship between perceived paternal nurturance, self-perception, and leadership status. (2) <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> further studies <b>be</b> conducted among middle class children who's language in the home is standard English. (3) <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> each testing instrument be administered on separate days. (4) <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> subjects <b>be</b> randomly selected from several schools rather than one. (5) <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> further studies <b>be</b> executed to explore the relationship of successful peer interaction and paternal nurturance...|$|R

5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine {{should be used}} to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> {{those with}} the {{syndrome}} {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
