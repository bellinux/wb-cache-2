40|$|McNeil, SueTransportation {{systems are}} {{a class of}} {{critical}} civil infrastructure systems that {{must be able to}} respond to disruptions while continuing to provide mobility as well as reduce both human and property loss when disasters occur. " In the aftermath of these catastrophic events, <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are among those most sensitive to delay. Considering the importance of the <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> and the special case of a damaged network after a disaster, the goal of this research is to develop a method to evaluate the performance of the transportation system, specifically for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips,</b> after an earthquake. The first step in reaching this goal is to understand the particulars of the hazard itself and how the transportation system should be prepared. A limited number of earthquake scenarios, representing specific historical data and the possible events that occur in the aftermath, have been chosen to represent the hazard. The impact of each of these scenarios on the transportation components - specifically, bridges - is estimated in this research. In the following step, models predicting a number of <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> have been developed, followed by both supply and demand side is simulated with a macro simulation software. Travel delay and other measures to evaluate the performance of the transportation system are also calculated. Lastly, areas susceptible to the greatest delay for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are identified and countermeasures to reduce the delay are proposed. This method is used for two case studies: one in Newark, Delaware, and one in the San Fernando Valley of California. The Newark case study is used to understand the application of the methodology using a familiar network even though the area is not inherently vulnerable to earthquakes. The results of the analysis are as expected with relatively minor impacts. The San Fernando Valley case study used forty-nine earthquake scenarios. The analysis underscored the difficulties of accessing some of the more remote parts of the network, identifying areas underserved by medical and fire centers, and identified bridges that could impact the effectiveness of emergency response. While <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are relatively small in number, the analysis demonstrates that in some areas these trips may be significantly impacted by disruption to the transportation network. These disruptions require understanding the demand for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> and understanding how these trips use the transportation network.

40|$|Feline asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed respiratory ailments of cats. Traditionally, feline asthma has been managed with oral corticosteroids to decrease underlying inflammation and brochodilators (selective beta 2 adrenergic agonists or methylxanthines) to reverse smooth muscle contraction. Over the past few years, veterinarians have adopted the use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for delivery of medications directly into feline airways. Both corticosteroids and selective beta 2 adrenergic agonists are available as MDI preparations. The benefits of aerosolized therapy include increased drug concentration at the site of action and decreased systemic absorption, leading to few side effects. In addition, the faster onset of action facilitated by the aerosolized delivery of bronchodilators offers owners an in-home treatment for acute asthmatic attacks, reducing <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> to the veterinarian or helping to stabilize the patient during transport. Despite the promise of inhaled therapies in the treatment of feline asthma, clinical trials are needed to establish their safety and efficacy in cats...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 96 The {{catastrophic failure}} of a high {{pressure}} centrifugal air compressor utilizing air-pressurized bearing housings dictated the redesign of its sister compressor. The modification of this early 1950 's compressor involved elements of both practical and analytical design. The project included the design of new bearings and seals and the alteration of various support systems to permit operation with non-pressurized bearing housings. The project was undertaken as risk minimization, with all performance and reliability improvements being additional benefits. The matching of the computer model with the field data of the existing system {{was the key to}} its successful evaluation. It was found that a case seal was acting as an additional bearing during certain operating conditions. This third bearing caused the compressor to behave differently than had been predicted with the initial two-bearing models. With the system properly modeled, changes were proposed to optimize the rotor dynamics. The main objectives were to achieve reliable rotor dynamic characteristics and to maintain the integrity of the process labyrinth seals. The changes were made in April, 1982, with the normal hardware fitting considerations. The subsequent start-up and operation were without incident. The modified compressor has performed well through a number of <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> and subsequent restarts, exhibiting exceptional rotor stability and overall reliability...|$|R
