500|$|Mitsuda {{slept in}} his studio several nights, and {{attributed}} certain songs, such as [...] "To Far Away Times", to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the song was made in dedication to [...] "a certain person with whom <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a generation." [...] Mitsuda tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme {{to create a sense}} of consistency in the soundtrack. He also suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, regular Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene. Mitsuda considers Chrono Trigger a landmark title which helped mature his talent. While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was [...] "rough around the edges," [...] he maintains that it had [...] "significant influence on my life as a composer." [...] At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented, causing the soundtrack to span three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.|$|E
