50|$|Chosen for {{its high}} <b>gum</b> <b>content,</b> agba formed easily without {{splitting}} and glued well. All the dinghy classes used just three agba veneers {{while some of}} the bigger boats used up to six. Initially all the veneers were laid at 45° while later boats changed to fore and aft outer planking for aesthetic reasons.With the keel, stem and transom in place, veneers were applied starting on the centreline and working out towards the shear. Each veneer was held in place by just three staples at the keel, bilge and shearline. Roller-application of Borden One-Shot waterproof glue preceded each veneer except the first. With all veneers in place a vacuum bag was drawn over the moulding and secured in place using a clamp plate and G-clamps.Early vacuum bags were made from war surplus barrage balloon fabric. After about 1950, individual rubber bags were prepared on the moulds using uncured rubber sheets which were subsequently vulcanised in the autoclaves used for production.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} {{residual}} gum exists in degummed or retted hemp fibres. Gum removal results in improvement in fibre fineness and {{the properties of the}} resultant hemp yarns. However, it is not known what correlation if any exists between the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> in retted hemp fibres and the fibre fineness, described in terms of fibre width in this paper. This study examined the mean width and coefficient of variation (CV) of fibre width of seventeen chemically retted hemp samples with reference to residual <b>gum</b> <b>content.</b> The mean and CV of fibre width were obtained from an Optical fibre diameter analyser (OFDA 100). The linear regression analysis results show that the mean fibre width is directly proportional to the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content.</b> A slightly weaker linear correlation also exists between the coefficient of variation of fibre width and the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content.</b> The strong linear co-relation between the mean of fibre width and the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> is a significant outcome, since testing for fibre width using the OFDA is a much simpler and quicker process than testing the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content.</b> Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reinforces the OFDA findings.

We prepared the metformin gum to overcome its side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdomen discomfort. Furthermore, {{it could be useful}} for those who have swallowing problems. Materials and Methods: Metformin hydrochloride (250 mg) with suitable sweeteners was mixed manually for 5 min. This mixture was spray dried, freeze dried, or directly mixed with chewing gum base. Glycerin, xylitol, and menthol were added and the produced paste was kept in the freezer for 2 h to be stable. As the metformin shows bitter taste, we tried to mask this unpleasant taste with using different methods explained. The releasing pattern was evaluated by using a mechanical chewing machine. The best formulation with the optimized releasing pattern, suitable physicochemical properties and pleasant taste were selected.

To test the sensitivity of this technique using the setup available, a preliminary study was performed on a similar size fragment cut out from an artificial sample of indigo in as little amount of animal glue as possible, painted on Chinese paper and covered in a thick layer (80  μm) of gum Arabic. The artificial sample is meant to represent the worst case scenario where the animal glue content is low and the <b>gum</b> Arabic <b>content</b> is high. Despite the expected reduction in the digestive ability of trypsin {{as a result of}} the addition of this gum Arabic, the examination of the artificial sample showed that the platform was capable of detecting peptides derived from three separate types of bovine collagen (1330 total bovine peptides identified at 1  % false discovery rate from the three collagen types). In contrast, examination of the map fragment did not detect collagen proteins that were distinguishable from those identified within the controls. The absence of collagen would strongly suggest that animal glue is not the binding medium. However, trace amount of proteins were identified from bovine and sheep casein which are usually associated with a glair binder (milk) sometimes used in European manuscripts but not in East Asian paintings. Sheep milk is sometimes used with a gum Arabic binder to improve the texture of a paint such that of vermilion in the Indo-Persian tradition [40].

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{eco-friendly}} apparel and technical textiles {{has led to}} a resurgence of interests in bast fibres such as hemp. The lack of fast and objective evaluation of the quality attributes of bast fibres has been a major barrier to the advancement of the bast fibre industry. One of the most important quality attributes of a fibre is its fineness. For bast fibres, the fibre fineness measurement can also reflect the degree of fibre separation during retting or degumming. The traditional method of evaluating the fineness and residual <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> of bast fibres is a very tedious process. In this paper, degummed hemp fibres have been measured for fineness on an Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser (OFDA), and the results have been co-related with the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> in the fibre samples. Since hemp fibres do not have a circular cross section, it is the width of the fibre that gets measured by the OFDA instrument, and this width has been used as an indication of the fibre fineness in this paper.

Meanwhile crop species used were millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sesame (Sesamum indicum). The trial was {{laid out in a}} completely randomized block design with three replications for each crop as well as control plots for trees and crops. Tree parameters measured include tree height in (m), tree diameter (cm), tree canopy diameter (m) and tree crown projection (m) as well as tree root profile was excavated to determine lateral tree root zone. The crop variables were; plant population density in ha, number of leaf/plant, plant height (cm), days to 50 % flowering, days to harvesting time, crops yield (kg/ha), 1000 -seeds weight (g), straw weight (kg/ha) and land equivalent ratio (LER). Soil parameters namely, soil fertility (nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus) as well as soil moisture content were measured. Therefore, soil samples were augured under trees and in the open areas in each plot at varied depths, namely 0 - 20 cm, 20 - 40 cm and 40 - 60 cm and 0 - 25 cm, 25 - 50 cm and 50 - 75 cm in the first two seasons and third season respectively. Besides, composite soil samples were also augured at 30 cm depth under tree canopy and in the open areas as well as control areas to determine soil nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus <b>contents.</b> <b>Gum</b> arabic yield was tapped within the tree spacings concerned to determine gum yield production per tree in (g). The results indicated that plant population density, number of leaf/plant and plant height were affected by tree spacings. Therefore, significant differences were obtained within crop species and tree spacings in the different studied seasons. In addition, crop days to 50 % flowering and crops days to harvesting time were affected by tree/crop interface as well as soil moisture content in the third season. While, crops yield, 1000 - seeds weight and straw weight were affected by both tree spacings and rainfall amounts between the studied seasons. Land equivalent ratio was found higher in the 8 x 8 m tree spacing for millet and sesame crops. Whereas tree height, tree diameter, tree canopy diameter and tree crown projection were affected by tree/crop interaction particularly in the intercropped plots. Furthermore, tree root zone was superficial and fine roots were spread in the surface soil layer. However, total soil moisture content was found to be higher under this agroforestry system than in open areas, namely in the 4 x 4 m and the 8 x 8 m tree spacings...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of non-hydrofining is {{proposed}} to improve the stability of diesel fraction of Fushun shale oil. The experimental results show that solvent extraction is efficiently selective to remove nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-containing compounds. At the temperature of 10 - 30 degrees C, diesel fraction is continuously extracted by using the 7 - 10 % additive-containing solvent three times at the ratio of solvent to oil of 0. 2. Thereafter, the oil layer is washed by aqueous alkali and water. The recovery of refined oil is more than 75 %, and the <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> is less than 70 mg/ 100 mL.

40|$|Abstract. Alkaline {{pectinase}} has a broad application prospect in textile field. In hemp degumming, enzymatic degumming {{is preferred}} {{because of the}} better fiber quality and less environmental pollution. In this thesis, we used the recombinant strain Bacillus subtilis TCCC 11485 constructed in our laboratory to express high-yield alkaline pectinase. The optimal conditions of the alkaline pectinase for hemp degumming were determined by single factor experiments as: bath ratio 1 : 36, pH 8, 45 C, enzyme activity 600 U/mL, degumming for 6 h. Under the above conditions, the residual <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> of fiber is 32. 76 %. Further, the scanning electron microscopy(SEM) was also used to compare quality of the hemp fibers produced by enzymatic-, chemical- degumming. The results showes that the fibers are in higher quality by alkaline pectinase degumming, suggesting the prospect of commercial applications in domestic textile industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{fundamental}} requirements of liquid hydrocarbon fuels for spark-ignition engines, namely that the fuel should vaporize satisfactorily and burn {{in a controlled}} manner. The phenomenon of knock {{and the development of}} the octane scale are discussed. The variation in pressure time histories between engines is discussed, along with how this leads to different fuel requirements. The difference in the octane rating tests, and how engine down-sizing exacerbates these differences in the pressure time histories is discussed. The applicability of RON and MON to modern engines is reviewed, along with the phenomenon of low speed preignition and mega-knock. The effect of hydrocarbon fuel distillation characteristics on drivability and emissions is reviewed, and placed in a historical context and the current legislative requirements. Brief mention is made of other fuel requirements such as density, <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> and aromatic content...|$|E

The inhibition efficiency increased {{with an increase in}} exudate <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> and decreases with increase in temperature. The adsorption of exudate gum from R. hookeri on the mild steel follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Guar gum {{has been shown to be}} an effective corrosion inhibitor for some metals in aggressive acid environment according to the study by Abdallah [11]. Results obtained show that natural substances act as effective corrosion inhibitors in the different test media.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{naturally}} occurring exudate gum from Raphia hookeri (RH) on the corrosion of mild steel in H 2 SO 4 in the temperature range 30 - 60 oC was studied by {{weight loss and}} hydrogen evolution techniques. Results obtained reveal that the exudate gum reduces the corrosion rate. The inhibition efficiency increased {{with an increase in}} exudate <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> up to 5 g/l to reach 70 % at 30 oC and decreases with increase in temperature. The adsorption of exudate gum from Raphia hookeri on the mild steel follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Results obtained by weight loss and hydrogen evolution technique are in good agreement. The addition of halide ions to the exudate gum enhanced the inhibition efficiency due to synergistic effect. Mechanism of physical adsorption is proposed from the apparent activation energy (Ea) and the thermodynamic parameters obtained. The adsorption of the exudate gum on the mild steel surface is spontaneous...|$|E
40|$|RESTRITOIn this {{research}} work, {{the effect of}} different concentrations of copper, iron, lead, zinc and nickel ions on the tendency for gum formation in gasohol fuel is investigated. For that purpose, a gasohol sample has been doped with these five metals ions at concentration levels of 0. 25, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0 μg ml− 1. Washed <b>gum</b> <b>content</b> tests {{have been carried out}} using ASTM D 381 on samples stored for 7, 14, and 28 days. The results show that gum formation is strongly affected by Cu and Fe, with a much weaker effect from Ni and Zn, and an almost negligible effect from Pb. A variance analysis (ANOVA) of the experimental results shows that an increase in metal concentration strongly increases the rate of gum formation for all metal ions investigated, particularly Cu and Fe, while an increase in storage time has only a much weaker effect, being negligible for Zn...|$|E
