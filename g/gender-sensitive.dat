5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a <b>gender-sensitive</b> dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

25|$|At {{the request}} of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's {{participation}} in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan covering the seven commitment areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress on the women, peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women. In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future post-disaster and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven <b>gender-sensitive</b> peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.|$|E

It started as a new edition of Siddur Sim Shalom just for Shabbat and Festivals (it contains no weekday services; this resulting thinner edition is thus nicknamed [...] "Slim Shalom"). Most of the translations are nearly identical to Harlow's 1985 edition, but this siddur uses <b>gender-sensitive</b> translations {{of the names of}} God, and presents the option to use the Imahot (matriarchs) in the Amidah (Shemoneh Esrei).|$|E

2500|$|This {{index is}} useful in {{understanding}} and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and income poverty. For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty. In her article, [...] "Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands {{on the possibility of}} a <b>gender-sensitive</b> index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health services, access to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, {{it is important to note}} that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women.|$|E
