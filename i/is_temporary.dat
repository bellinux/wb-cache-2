5|$|The {{line will}} operate as M3 and M4. The former will run a full circle, while M4 will only {{operate on the}} eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Nørrebro. This {{solution}} <b>is</b> <b>temporary,</b> once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn, the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch. Later, when the Sydhavn extension has been completed, the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus. Trains will operate both ways through the circle. The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000daily passengers, bringing the metro's total daily ridership to 460,000.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Sanders {{has also}} written on the variety of views Christians affirm {{on the nature of}} hell with special {{attention}} given to how divine love and justice are understood. Though some Christians understand suffering in hell to be literal, others conceive it as annihilation or that hell <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> until all turn to God. He edited a collection on violence in relation to the atonement.|$|E
25|$|In Buddhism {{there are}} several Heavens, {{all of which are}} still part of samsara (illusionary reality). Those who {{accumulate}} good karma may be reborn in one of them. However, their stay in Heaven is not eternal—eventually they will use up their good karma and will undergo rebirth into another realm, as a human, animal or other being. Because Heaven <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> and part of samsara, Buddhists focus more on escaping the cycle of rebirth and reaching enlightenment (nirvana). Nirvana is not a heaven but a mental state.|$|E

25|$|Both {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} strengthen behavior, or increase {{the probability of}} a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied (positive reinforcement) or something removed or avoided (negative reinforcement). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus (negative punishment or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences. Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.|$|E
25|$|Clinical studies {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} morphine, like other opioids, often causes hypogonadism and hormone imbalances in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is dose-dependent and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine {{can interfere with}} menstruation in women by suppressing levels of luteinizing hormone. Many studies suggest the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced hypogonadism. This effect may cause the increased likelihood of osteoporosis and bone fracture observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect <b>is</b> <b>temporary.</b> , the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> in nature, {{caused by}} {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

25|$|The three-star grade goes hand-in-hand {{with the}} {{position}} of office it is linked to, so the rank <b>is</b> <b>temporary.</b> Officers may only achieve three-star grade if they are appointed to positions that require the officer to hold such a rank. Their rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute. Vice admirals are nominated for appointment by the President from any eligible officers holding the rank of rear admiral (lower half) or above, who also meet the requirements for the position, under the advice and/or suggestion of their respective department secretary, service secretary, and if applicable, the Joint Chiefs. The nominee must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate before the appointee can take office and thus assume the rank. The standard tour length for most vice admiral positions is three years but some are set four or more years by statute.|$|E
25|$|Tactically, a Marine {{aircraft}} squadron is task-organized for {{a specific}} mission that may call for from one aircraft to the entire squadron. This tactical organization <b>is</b> <b>temporary</b> and fluid and rarely lasts with the same aircraft/aircrews {{for more than one}} mission. This continual reorganization occurs as aircraft and aircrews are rotated onto the flight schedule per aircraft availability, crew rest, and other considerations. A general tactical organizational scheme is: sortie - one aircraft on one mission, under the command of a designated aircraft commander (multi-pilot/crew aircraft only); section - two or three aircraft, under the command of a designated section leader; division - two or three sections under the command of a designated division leader, squadron - two or three divisions, under the command of the squadron commander or his designated representative (e.g., executive officer, operations officer, etc.). Traditionally, the lead aircraft belongs to the commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{immunity}} {{can also}} be gained passively, in which antibodies to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily immunoglobulin G antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns, or artificially, by which antibodies from the serum or plasma of an immune individual are injected into a susceptible person. Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate but wanes {{over the course of}} weeks to months, so any contribution to herd immunity <b>is</b> <b>temporary.</b> For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns, such as influenza and tetanus, pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child. In the same way, high-risk groups that are either more likely to experience infection or are more likely to develop complications from infection may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms.|$|E
