25|$|In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian {{product of}} two circles: S1×S1, {{and the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus {{is one way to}} embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Cartesian product of the embedding of S1 in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.|$|E
25|$|Because {{dark matter}} {{remains to be}} {{conclusively}} identified, many theories that aim to explain the observational evidence without invoking dark matter have emerged. The obvious way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar-system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales is less certain. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably {{eliminate the need for}} dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, f(R) gravity and entropic gravity. Alternative theories abound.|$|E

25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves and do whatever it is they want to <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E
25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E

25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal destructive interference. One way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{to add a}} second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces produces destructive interference and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the visible range (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E
25|$|With the Authority {{beginning}} to forcefully expand {{its influence on}} the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act {{with the help of}} Raine who is able to recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all of the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

25|$|At its core, {{sacrifice}} {{symbolized the}} renewal of divine energy and, in doing so, the continuation of life. Its ability of bloodletting to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> based on two intertwined concepts that are prevalent in the Maya belief system. The first {{is the notion that}} the gods had given life to humankind by sacrificing parts of their own bodies. The second is the central focus of their mythology on human blood, which signified life among the Maya. Within their belief system, human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods.|$|E
25|$|Models like PB and GB allow {{estimation}} of the mean electrostatic free energy but do {{not account for the}} (mostly) entropic effects arising from solute-imposed constraints on the organization of the water or solvent molecules. This is termed the hydrophobic effect and is {{a major factor in the}} folding process of globular proteins with hydrophobic cores. Implicit solvation models may be augmented with a term that accounts for the hydrophobic effect. The most popular way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> by taking the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a proxy of the extent of the hydrophobic effect. Most authors place the extent of this effect between 5 and 45 cal/(Å2 mol). Note that this surface area pertains to the solute, while the hydrophobic effect is mostly entropic in nature at physiological temperatures and occurs on the side of the solvent.|$|E
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement {{along the length of the}} tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
