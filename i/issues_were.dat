5|$|Before the {{deployment}} there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} not decided if {{the deployment}} would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> resolved; many other conditions-of-service <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> identified, but not resolved. During the deployment few <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> digest-sized, with 132 pages, {{and were}} priced at 35 cents. The <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{numbered}} {{as a single}} volume with two issues.|$|E

5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{not as important}} as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|While {{most public}} works <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, {{following}} the 1909 election Rutherford named {{himself as the}} province's first Minister of Railways.|$|E

5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{the economies}} of both nations {{experienced}} rapid recoveries; bilateral relations, now focused on economic <b>issues,</b> <b>were</b> soon re-established.

5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E

50|$|Tux {{was not a}} print magazine: each <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} digitally as a PDF file. The {{magazine was}} established in 2004. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> published on February 1, 2005 and further 19 issues followed almost every month. On January 1, 2007, the publisher announced that the December 2006 <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> the last for the moment, because financial and other issues required a re-evaluation of how to best serve the reader community. All <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> still obtainable from the Tux Magazine website.|$|R

5|$|During the war, Japan brought {{as many as}} 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000–8,000 Koreans {{were killed}} in Hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean {{survivors}} {{had a difficult time}} fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of the free health benefits to them. Most <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} {{upon the}} launch of the Anniversary Update ("Redstone"), including a bug that caused some devices to freeze (but addressed by cumulative update KB3176938, released on August 31, 2016), and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams had caused many to stop working.|$|E

5|$|He was {{described}} by sportswriters of the time {{as one of the}} fastest pitchers in the league, comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein. Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as fast as Rusie, and could have extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts' <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, Ferdinand VII {{refused to}} renew the Spanish Constitution of 1812, {{returning}} the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ramírez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 reales. The <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> printed by Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company and featured the signatures of treasurer José Bacener and Ramírez. The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually. No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related {{to the creation of}} these notes have surfaced. These <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.|$|E
