Furthermore, we compare the <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with those of UK consumers, for which we use data from the 2001 - 2007 February GfK NOP consumer surveys. Our analysis indicates substantial disagreement among UK consumers, and between the MPC and consumers, concerning one-year- ahead <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Such disagreement persisted throughout the sample, with no signs of convergence, consistent with consumers' inflation expectations not being "well-anchored" in the sense of matching the central bank's expectations.

50|$|The SNB pursues a {{monetary}} policy serving {{the interests of}} the country as a whole. It must ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments. Monetary policy affects production and prices with a considerable time lag. Consequently, it is based on inflation forecasts rather than current inflation. The SNB’s monetary policy strategy consists of three elements: a definition of price stability (the SNB equates price stability with a rise in the national consumer price index of less than 2% per year), a medium-term conditional <b>inflation</b> <b>forecast,</b> and, at operational level, a target range for a reference interest rate, which is the Libor for three-month investments in Swiss francs.|$|E
5000|$|In the Bank of England’s {{implementation}} it {{is assumed}} that the forecast distribution is a two piece normal or split normal density. This density results from joining the two halves of corresponding normal densities with the same mode but different variances. As a result, the split normal density is non-symmetric and uni-modal. In this case, <b>inflation</b> <b>forecast</b> fan charts are usually accompanied with the balance of risks, the probability that the future inflation falls below its modal forecast.

In December 2012 Krugman again addressed Murphy's failed inflation predictions, criticizing Murphy's belief that [...] "his failed <b>inflation</b> <b>forecast</b> is OK" [...] because it is attributable to [...] "huge deflationary downdraft that offset the inflationary impact of Fed expansion." [...] Krugman wrote that if that was true, [...] "we should be hailing Ben Bernanke for preventing a catastrophic deflation." [...] Murphy replied on his blog to Krugman and DeLong's criticisms, saying [...] "my price inflation wager {{has nothing to do}} with Austrian business cycle theory" [...] and that Krugman was using a [...] "macro model" [...] which does not apply to Austrian theory which relies on [...] "heterogeneous capital goods" [...] and artificially low interest rates distortion of investment flows into various sectors. He admitted he was not sure why his inflation prediction was wrong. In a May 2013 piece published by The American Conservative, Murphy wrote about Krugman's predictions regarding fiscal austerity and the 2013 U.S. government budget sequestration.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study aims to both {{test the}} {{asymmetric}} information hypothesis {{and explore the}} factors influencing the one- through four-quarter-ahead Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> for 1983 - 2002. Design/methodology/approach – Encompassing tests are {{used to examine the}} asymmetric information hypothesis. In modeling the Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts,</b> the authors are mindful of alternative theories of inflation which emphasize such determinants as cost-push, demand-pull and inertial factors. Findings – First, the Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> embody useful predictive information beyond that contained in the private forecasts. Second, with the private forecasts controlled for, the near-term Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> make use of qualitative information, and the longer-term forecasts are influenced by the forecasts of growth in both unit labor costs and aggregate demand as well as the preceding-quarter <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> and monetary policy shifts. Research limitations/implications – The Federal Reserve forecasts are released to the public with a five-year lag and are currently available up to the fourth quarter of 2002. This limits the use of the most up-to-date forecasts desirable for this study. Originality/value – The factors influencing the Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> are basically those emphasized publicly by monetary authorities. This finding points to the Fed's transparency and should thus help enhance its credibility with the public. Also, our results (which shed light on the predictive information in the Federal Reserve <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> not included in the private forecasts) are of value, since they can help the Fed better predict how inflation will respond to policy actions, and they can help the public form more informative inflationary expectations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical strategy that bridges {{the gap between}} event studies and macroeconomic forecasts based on common-factor models. Event studies examine the response of financial variables to a market-sensitive "surprise" component using a narrow event window. The authors argue that these features - narrow event window and surprise component - can be easily embedded in common-factor models that study the real-time impact of macroeconomic announcements on key policy variables such as inflation or gross domestic product growth. Demonstrative applications are provided for Swiss inflation that show that (i) the communication of monetary policy announcements generates an asymmetric response for <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts,</b> (ii) the pass-through effect of import price releases on <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> is weak, and (iii) macroeconomic releases of real and nominal variables generate nonsynchronized effects for <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts.</b> <b>Inflation</b> (Finance); <b>Forecasting...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Inflation</b> <b>forecasts</b> are a {{cornerstone}} of central bank monetary policy formulation. Most central banks rely {{on a variety of}} methods to drive their <b>inflation</b> <b>forecasts,</b> ranging from large macro models to smaller empiricist models.

Specifically, using ex-post data over a sample period ranging from 1992 to 2000, an algorithm is developed to combine information from a set of several hundred potential indicators of inflation.

We then test whether these estimated conditions satisfy the predictions of models of optimal monetary policy.

The inflation forecasts’ credibility index may be calculated for all types of inflation forecasts made by central banks, which implement an inflation targeting (IT) regime.
