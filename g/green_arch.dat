6000|$|There was no bridal procession, but {{a sudden}} silence fell upon {{the room as}} Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the <b>green</b> <b>arch.</b> Mother and sisters {{gathered}} close, as if loath to give Meg up.

As she paused, Manuel flung down the lorgnette and was striding past her with ireful impetuosity, but the white arms took him captive, adding another figure to the picture framed by the <b>green</b> <b>arch</b> as she whispered decisively, [...] "No farther!

The moon shone full on Warwick, looking out straight and strong before him with the vigilant expression native to his face; a fit helmsman to guide the boat along that rapid stream. Mark seemed pausing to watch the oars silvered by the light, and their reflections wavy with the current. Moor, seen in shadow, leaned upon his hand, as if watching Sylvia, a quiet figure, full of grace and color, couched under the <b>green</b> <b>arch.</b> On either hand the summer woods made vernal gloom, behind the cliffs rose sharply up against the blue, and all before wound a shining road, along which the boat seemed floating like a bird on slender wings between two skies.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} has a Greek cross shaped groundplan and two storeys high, although since the building straddles a declivity, only one floor is {{visible from the}} main entrance. The exterior glazed bricks show a Central Asian influence, especially from the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand. The square, axial plan represents {{the four corners of}} the world and symbolizes, in architectural terms, the universal authority and sovereignty of the Sultan. As there is no Byzantine influence, the building is ascribed to an unknown Persian architect. The stone-framed brick and the polygonal pillars of the façade are typical of Persia. A grilled gate leads to the basement. Two flights of stairs above this gate lead to a roofed colonnaded terrace. This portico was rebuilt in the 18th century. The great door in the middle, surrounded by a tiled <b>green</b> <b>arch,</b> leads to the vestibule and then to a loftily domed court. The three royal apartments are situated behind, with the middle apartment in apsidal form.|$|E
