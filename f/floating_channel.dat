40|$|Abstract. A {{network system}} is given {{as a set}} of Petri net-like {{structures}} called agents. Each agent has a singled out place interpreted as a communication port with ingoing edges labelled with send(p 1, [...] ., pn) and receive(q 1, [...] ., qm) commands, where pi, qj are names of ports of its interlocutors. Every such edge exits a transition emiting a request for send or receive message. A transmission channel between the agent and its intelocutors is established when its port holds a send or receive command, while ports of its interlocutors hold respective (matching) communication commands. This gives rise to communication between the agent and its interlocutors, after which the channel is disrupted: hence <b>floating</b> <b>channels.</b> Some behavioural properties of such network system are examined, their decision complexity, deadlock and fairness in their number. ...|$|R

The landscape was already in the first decennium of the 19 th century reformated negatively, namely in forest crops. The number of colonies of woodworkers increased. The problems came in 1870 ´s with windbreake and bark beetle calamities. Crisis and termination of the wood floating in the region came on the first half of 20 th century in connection with world war and political changes. But the landscape and settlement experienced changes in folowing years of comunism as well. Next break came with the breakdown of iron curtain.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{dynamics}} {{investigations of}} ions in certain non-bulk media predict {{that they are}} capable of significantly greater mobilities than when in the liquid state. The entries of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions from electrolyte media into proposed synthetic channels consisting of fourteen 15 -crownether- 5 (CE) rings bonded in stacked conformations are described and their subsequent dynamics in the channel discussed. The importance of channel flexibility is established by investigating two CE channels that are structurally similar but vary in the rigidity with which their rings are connected. The dynamics of cation channel migrants are simulated across a bilayer membrane between two bulk aqueous salt solutions and also when the <b>channel</b> <b>floats</b> freely in an aqueous medium. Various features of ion behaviour are investigated in the presence, and in the absence, of an electric field applied along the channel axis.

The frictional forces opposing the ion trajectories are calculated, found to be ~ 10 nN and attempts to formulate frictional laws for nanoscale systems are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model for an interacting ice shelf and ocean {{is presented in}} which the iceshelf base exhibits a channelized morphology similar to that observed beneath Petermann Gletscher’s (Greenland) <b>floating</b> ice shelf. <b>Channels</b> are initiated by irregularities in the ice along the grounding line and then enlarged by ocean melting. To a first approximation, spatially variable basal melting seaward of the grounding line acts as a steel-rule die or a stencil, imparting a channelized form to the ice base as it passes by. Ocean circulation {{in the region of}} high melt is inertial in the along-channel direction and geostrophically balanced in the transverse direction. Melt rates depend on the wavelength of imposed variations in ice thickness where it enters the shelf, with shorter wavelengths reducing overall melting. Petermann Gletscher’s narrow basal channels may therefore act to preserve the ice shelf against excessive melting. Overall melting in the model increases for a warming of the subsurface water. The same sensitivity holds for very slight cooling, but for cooling of a few tenths of a degree a reorganization of the spatial pattern of melting leads, surprisingly, to catastrophic thinning of the ice shelf 12 km from the grounding line. Subglacial discharge of fresh water along the grounding line increases overall melting. The eventual steady state depends on when discharge is initiated in the transient history of the ice, showing that multiple steady states of the coupled system exist in general...|$|R
40|$|For many centuries, streams, {{rivers and}} oceans {{have been used}} for the {{disposal}} of all kinds of man-made wastes and pollutants, of which some are extremely harmful. Studies of the spreading of these effluents require the knowledge of the velocity distribution and current patterns. A practical and alternative way to fixed current meters is the use of tracers such as combined floats or drogues. The purpose of this laboratory investigation is to study the use of combined floats, consisting of a floating disc and a spherical weight, for velocity and discharge measurements and float diffusion. An experimental program was carried out in the hydraulics laboratory and it was found useful to investigate the effect of (i) length and width of the study section, (ii) float size and its depth of immersion and finally (iii) the velocity itself (the magnitude). Because of the limitations involved, three float sizes were selected for which only the disc diameter varied; the sphere diameter, however, was kept constant. When compared to the velocity measured by the Pitot tube, a combination of the smallest <b>float</b> submerged at <b>channel</b> depths above 0. 6 d in a relatively uniform small section (width and length) was found more appropriate and consequently more accurate. Float diffusion on the other hand was found to depend mainly on the study section length and the float size.

40|$|We report first-principles electronic-structure {{calculations}} that {{clarify the}} floating nature of electron states in covalent semiconductors. It is found that wave functions of several conduction- and valence-band states, including the conduction-band minima, do not distribute near atomic sites, as {{was taken for}} granted, but <b>float</b> in interstitial <b>channels</b> in most semiconductors. The floating states have a nearly-free-electron(NFE) -like character, and extend in the channels broadly without atomic-orbital characters. The electrostatic potential at the channels and the directions and shapes of the interstitial channels depend on the crystal symmetry so that mysterious variation of the energy gaps in silicon carbide (SiC) polytypes is naturally explained by considering the floating nature. In addition, {{we have found that}} the floating states are closely related to the anisotropy in effective masses in SiC. It has been found that most conduction-band minima have floating nature. The existence of the floating state comes from the internal space in the crystal structures, and non-spherical charge distribution. The substantial band-gap variation in SiC has been analyzed by an empirical parameter "hexagonality" for a half century. Yet, we have clarified that the parameter "hexagonality" is a misleading parameter. Instead, we have found that a new parameter "channel length", which represents the spatial extension of the floating state, is essential in describing the band-gap variation in SiC. In addition, we have performed the linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO) calculations and compared the results with those calculated by the plane-wave-basis set. It is found that the floating characters in the electron states are difficult to be pursued in the LCAO calculations. We have also examined the floating states in pressurized sp 3 -bonded materials. We have also found that the energy bands with floating character manifest different behavior from other bands with atomic-orbital character under the pressurized circumstances. 報告番号:; 学位授与日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科物理工学専...|$|R

This algorithm describes the weight updating rules for both the vertical fixed (nature-like) and the lateral adaptive (nurture-like) weighted interconnections in the PMCM. The learning algorithm for the lateral weight adaptations is new, and derived based on the multi-layer error back-propagation (BP) supervised learning algorithm using gradient descent method. Results from a simple optical character recognition (OCR) simulation show: (1) A PMCM with only one hidden neuron layer is sufficient to perform the OCR. (2) The Nature/Nurture trained neural network can recognize well the new modified patterns (generated from the original patterns) after the lateral weight adaptations.

40|$|We use a {{kinematic}} GPS {{and laser}} range finder survey of a 200 m-long {{section of the}} Muliwai a Pele lava channel (Mauna Ulu, Kilauea) to examine the construction processes and flow dynamics responsible for the channel–levee structure. The levees comprise three packages. The basal package comprises an 80 – 150 m wide ′a′a flow in which a ∼ 2 m deep and ∼ 11 m wide channel became centred. This is capped by a second package of thin (< 45 cm thick) sheets of pahoehoe extending no more than 50 m from the channel. The upper-most package comprises localised ′a′a overflows. The channel itself contains two blockages located 130 m apart and composed of levee chunks veneered with overflow lava. The channel was emplaced over 50 h, spanning 30 May– 2 June, 1974, with the flow front arriving at our section (4. 4 km from the vent) 8 h after the eruption began. The basal ′a′a flow thickness yields effusion rates of 35 m 3 s− 1 for the opening phase, with the initial flow advancing across the mapped section at ∼ 10 m/min. Short-lived overflows of fluid pahoehoe then built the levee cap, increasing the apparent channel depth to 4. 8 m. There were at least six pulses at 90 – 420 m 3 s− 1, causing overflow of limited extent lasting no more than 5 min. Brim-full flow conditions were thus extremely short-lived. During a dominant period of below-bank flow, flow depth was ∼ 2 m with an effusion rate of ∼ 35 m 3 s− 1, consistent with the mean output rate (obtained from the total flow bulk volume) of 23 – 54 m 3 s− 1. During pulses, levee chunks were plucked and <b>floated</b> down <b>channel</b> to form blockages. In a final low effusion rate phase, lava ponded behind the lower blockage to form a syn-channel pond that fed ′a′a overflow. After {{the end of the}} eruption the roofed-over pond continued to drain through the lower blockage, causing the roof to founder. Drainage emplaced inflated flows on the channel floor below the lower blockage for a further ∼ 10 h. The complex processes involved in levee–channel construction of this short-lived case show that care must be taken when using channel dimensions to infer flow dynamics. In our case, the full channel depth is not exposed. Instead the channel floor morphology reflects late stage pond filling and drainage rather than true channel-contained flow. Components of the compound levee relate to different flow regimes operating at different times during the eruption and associated with different effusion rates, flow dynamics and time scales. For example, although high effusion rate, brim-full flow was maintained for {{a small fraction of the}} channel lifetime, it emplaced a pile of pahoehoe overflow units that account for 60 % of the total levee height. We show how time-varying volume flux is an important parameter in controlling channel construction dynamics. Because the complex history of lava delivery to a channel system is recorded by the final channel morphology, time-varying flow dynamics can be determined from the channel morphology. Developing methods for quantifying detailed flux histories for effusive events from the evidence in outcrop is therefore highly valuable. We here achieve this by using high-resolution spatial data for a channel system at Kilauea. This study not only indicates those physical and dynamic characteristics that are typical for basaltic lava flows on Hawaiian volcanoes, but also a methodology that can be widely applied to effusive basaltic eruptions...|$|R
