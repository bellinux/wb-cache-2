A nominal controller (NC) that is designed without consideration of driver model uncertainty is also tested for comparison. Two types of experiments are proposed: a long driving task with nominal configurations and a short driving task with initially large lateral position error.

This study investigated {{the effect of a}} concurrent cognitive task on postural control in a sample of 50 nine-year-old children. Each subject completed two balance trials of 60 s, one with a concurrent cognitive task (cognitive load) and another with no cognitive load. The concurrent cognitive task consisted of mentally counting backwards in steps of 2. Twelve posturographic parameters (PPs) were extracted from the centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory obtained through a load cell force plate.

For practical systems the use of absolute stability is not useful; a system having an extremely long oscillatory response is unlikely to be accepted and would be liable to instability under small parameter variations. In this respect a measure of the relative stability can provide a more acceptable design criterion. This procedure results in a robust design able to operate under changing operating conditions, with guaranteed system stability under stationary and slowly varying conditions [...] The <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>stability</b> conditions are interpreted as spatial conditions on the geometry of the ANC system.

40|$|Response and {{dynamical}} {{stability of}} oscillators with discontinuous or steep first derivative of restoring characteristic is considered in this paper. For that purpose, a simple single-degree-of-freedom system with piecewise-linear force-displacement relationship {{subjected to a}} harmonic force excitation is analysed by the method of piecing the exact solutions (MPES) in the time domain and by the incremental harmonic balance method (IHBM) in the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain.</b> The <b>stability</b> of the periodic solutions obtained in the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> by IHBM is estimated by the Floquet-Lyapunov theorem. Obtained frequency response characteristic is very complex and includes multi-frequency response for a single frequency excitation, jump phenomenon, multi-valued and non-periodic solutions. Determining of frequency response characteristic in the time domain by MPES is exceptionally time consuming, particularly inside the frequency ranges of co-existence of multiple stable solutions. In the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain,</b> IHBM is very efficient and very well suited for obtaining wide range frequency response characteristics, parametric studies and bifurcation analysis. On the other hand, neglecting of very small harmonic terms (which in-significantly influence the r. m. s. values of the response and are very small in comparison to other terms of the spectrum) can cause very large error in evaluation of the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix, and so they can lead to incorrect prediction of the dynamical stability of the solution. Moreover, frequency ranges are detected inside which the procedure of evaluation of eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix does not converge with {{increasing the number of}} harmonics included in the supposed approximate solution.

40|$|The {{stability}} of some particular classes of control systems described by ordinary nonlinear differential equations is considered. As {{a means of}} introduction to the problem, systems containing a single nonlinearity in an otherwise linear, time-invariant closed loop are examined. Stability criteria based on the frequency-response of the linear {{part of the system}} are established by constructing a Liapunov function of a 'quadratic plus integral of non-linearity' form. The problem is extended to cover those classes of control systems which contain several such nonlinear functions (i. e. multivariable control systems) and <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>stability</b> criteria are established by constructing a Liapunov function akin to that described above. It is also asserted that stability criteria less restrictive than those obtained previously for these multivariable systems may be achieved by placing certain additional restrictions on the nonlinear functions. Some classes of systems containing nonlinear functions of a most general nature are considered in later chapters of this thesis. Frequency-domain stability criteria are established with the aid of quadratic forms of Liapunov functions. Again, if the complexities of these nonlinearities are reduced it is seen that less restrictive criteria than obtained previously may be established for these classes of systems. Emphasis is laid throughout upon the development of a unified approach to the problem of {{stability of}} the classes of systems considered. The criteria, once formulated, can be applied in practice without any further reference to the Liapunov function used...|$|E

This paper presents research on sensors and their effects on the reliability and response characteristics of power circuits in WoT devices. The presented research {{can be used in}} various power circuit applications, such as energy harvesting interfaces, photovoltaic systems, and battery management systems for the WoT devices. As power circuits rely on the feedback from voltage/current sensors, the system performance is likely to be affected by the sensor failure rates, sensor dynamic characteristics, and their interface circuits.

40|$|Multi-axis milling offers {{increased}} accessibility in milling {{of parts}} having geometrical constraints or free form surfaces, where variety of cutting tools and edge geometries are utilized to improve stability and {{productivity of the}} processes. In order to machine the desired geometries effectively, in conjunction with multi-axis orientations, special tools ranging from taper end mills to process specific form tools are utilized. For such cases, the cutter workpiece engagement boundaries (CWEB) and directional force vector definitions are very complex and cannot be defined analytically. Furthermore, irregular cutting edge geometries, such as variable helix, pitch and serrations introduce multiple time delays between successive cuts where the conventional analytical <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>stability</b> solution cannot be used. Prediction of stability diagrams for such variety of tool forms and edge geometries requires both {{the process and the}} tool to be defined in a generalized manner. In this paper, a numerical frequency domain milling stability solution method is proposed. The CWEB for complex multi-axis cases are calculated by the general projective geometry approach, where the cutting tool envelope and the cutting edges are represented as organized point clouds. Zeroth-Order approximation (ZOA) frequency domain method is adapted by introducing a speed average time delay term to encompass regular and irregular tool geometries. The stability limits are predicted by iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem using the ZOA frequency domain with the proposed revision. The effect of the process damping is also introduced into the generalized stability solution in order to predict the increase in the stability limits at low cutting speeds. A previously proposed approach is used to calculate the average process damping coefficients, which are introduced as modifiers to the modal parameters. The proposed generalized methodology is applied on several cases and it is shown that stability limits can be predicted within a reasonable accuracy for wide variety of cutting tools and milling operations...|$|E

The objective of the program was to assemble existing performance and combustion stability models into a usable design methodology capable of designing and analyzing high-performance and stable LOX/hydrocarbon booster engines. The methodology was then used to design a validation engine. The capabilities and validity of the methodology were demonstrated using this engine in an extensive hot fire test program. The engine used LOX/RP- 1 propellants and was tested over a range of mixture ratios, chamber pressures, and acoustic damping device configurations. This volume contains time domain and <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>stability</b> plots which indicate the pressure perturbation amplitudes and frequencies from approximately 30 tests of a 50 K thrust rocket engine using LOX/RP- 1 propellants over a range of chamber pressures from 240 to 1750 psia with mixture ratios of from 1. 2 to 7. 5. The data is from test configurations which used both bitune and monotune acoustic cavities and from tests with no acoustic cavities. The engine had a length of 14 inches and a contraction ratio of 2. 0 using a 7. 68 inch diameter injector. The data was taken from both stable and unstable tests. All combustion instabilities were spontaneous in the first tangential mode.

The decentralized control approach {{is superior to}} centralized control in view of lesser involvement of delay, minimal information sharing requirement, reduced computational effort for controller design etc. The dynamic model of leader follower formation with an information structure constraint, in which each vehicle except the leader have the information of all the states of vehicle in front of it. The formation is treated as an interconnected system with overlapping control gains in the sense an UAV share information only with its neighbouring ones. In this thesis, two approaches are used: (i) Inclusion principle (ii) Graph theory based approach for designing control gains. In the inclusion principle approach, control gain is designed separately for each disjoint subsystem in the expanded space. The static state feedback control law and linear matrix inequalities tool boxes are used for designing the controllers for each subsystem. Finally decentralized controllers are contracted back {{so as to be}} applied to the original system. In the graph theory approach, an overlapping information flow structure is constructed that determines the outputs of the system available in constructing any input signal of the system. The Graph theory is used to transform the overlapping interconnected system to decentralized one.

In order to meet GOES-R pointing stability requirements, the spacecraft flight software implements an Active Vibration Damping (AVD) rate control law which acts in parallel with the nadir point attitude control law. The AVD controller commands spacecraft reaction wheel actuators based upon Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) inputs to provide additional damping for spacecraft structural modes below 3. 0 Hz which vary with solar wing angle. A GOES-R spacecraft dynamics and attitude control system identified model is constructed from pseudo-random reaction wheel torque commands and IMU angular rate response measurements occurring over a single orbit during spacecraft post-deployment activities. The identified Fourier model is computed on the ground, uplinked to the spacecraft flight computer, and the AVD controller filter coefficients are periodically computed on-board from the Fourier model. Consequently, the AVD controller formulation is based not upon pre-launch simulation model estimates but upon on-orbit nadir point attitude control and time-varying spacecraft dynamics. GOES-R high-fidelity time domain simulation results herein demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} AVD identified Fourier model relative to the pre-launch spacecraft dynamics and control truth model. The AVD controller on-board the GOES- 16 spacecraft achieves more than a ten-fold increase in structural mode damping of the fundamental solar wing mode while maintaining controller stability margins and ensuring that the nadir point attitude control bandwidth does not fall below 0. 02 Hz.

Vehicles should (i) be able to recover their equilibrium speed, and (ii) react {{so as not to}} propagate but absorb perturbations. In this paper, we address the stability analysis of platoon systems consisting of heterogeneous vehicles updating their dynamics according to realistic behavioural car-following models. First, definitions of all types of stability that are of interest in the platoon system -asymptotic, input-output, weak and strict string stability- are carefully presented based on recent studies. Then, <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> linear <b>stability</b> analyses are conducted after linearisation of the modelled system of vehicles. They lead to conditions for input-output stability, strict and weak string stability over the behavioural parameters of the system, for finite and infinite platoons of homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicles. This provides a solid basis that was missing for car-following model-based control design in mixed traffic environments. After visualisation of the theoretical results in simulation, we formulate an optimisation strategy with LMI constraints to tune the behavioural parameters of the (partially) autonomous vehicles in mixed and heterogeneous traffic in order to maximise the stability of the traffic flow while considering the comfort of autonomous driving.
