5000|$|A Philidas nut is a locknut {{with one}} or more slots cut {{laterally}} in the reduced-diameter circular top for less than half the diameter, the metal above the slot(s) being deformed downwards so that over the last one or two turns, the thread for half the diameter is [...] "axially depitched" [...] or displaced from its normal position. As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These nuts retain their locking action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a radial displacement of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses axial deflection or <b>depitching.</b>|$|E

The ability of six sapstaining fungi to degrade and detoxify extractive constituents in Scots pine sapwood was examined, {{and the results}} were compared with those obtained with the commercial <b>depitching</b> fungus Cartapip (Ophiostoma piliferum). Pestalotiopsis crassiuscula and O. piliferum were the best strains and they provided high reductions of total resin (50 – 60 ␒n 6 weeks). Both strains were highly effective in the degradation of individual extractive components including triglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids. Although all strains displayed moderate to high pitch degradation, their detoxifying capacity was limited. Two important exceptions were Ceratocystis deltoideospora and O. piliferum that caused a 11 – 14 -fold decrease in toxicity (Microtox bioassay). These results indicate the potential of wood pretreatment with the selected sapstain fungi for minimizing pitch problems and decreasing effluent toxicity in pulping...|$|E
50|$|Partially <b>depitched</b> {{nuts are}} {{commonly}} called Philidas nuts, after their originator and current manufacturer, and {{differ from the}} above three nut types insofar as {{a portion of the}} thread is displaced axially, this being facilitated by one or more slots perpendicular to the axis.|$|R
50|$|A {{distorted}} thread locknut, {{is a type}} of locknut {{that uses}} a deformed section of thread to keep the nut from loosening from vibrations or rotation of the clamped item. They are broken down into four types: elliptical offset nuts, centerlock nuts, toplock nuts and partially <b>depitched</b> (Philidas) nuts.|$|R
40|$|Pitch {{information}} {{is known to}} be partially conveyed in Mel cepstral features that are commonly used for speaker recognition. In particular, for high pitched female speakers, and whenever average pitch varies significantly between enrollment and testing, the fine spectral structure introduced by the fundamental frequency was shown to degrade speaker recognition performance. This paper introduces a signal processing procedure termed <b>depitch</b> that attempts to remove pitch information from the speech signal. Recognition experiments carried out on the female subset of the NIST 2002 Speaker Recognition Evaluation show that by combining scores from a conventional and a <b>depitched</b> system, a substantial improvement in equal error rate is obtained for high pitched speakers and pitch-mismatched trials. Performing pitch/depitch score fusion is also shown to help alleviate the well-known problem of “goat” speakers. ...|$|R
40|$|Pitch {{mismatch}} between enrollment and testing {{is a common}} problem in speaker recognition systems. It {{is well known that}} the fine spectral structure related to fundamental frequency manifests itself in Mel cepstral features used for speaker recognition. Therefore pitch variations result in variation of the acoustic features, and potentially an increase in error rate. A previous study introduced a signal processing procedure termed <b>depitch</b> that attempts to remove pitch information from the speech signal by forcing every speech frame to be pitch synchronous and include a single pitch cycle. This paper presents a modification of the <b>depitch</b> algorithm, termed syncpitch, that performs pseudo pitch synchronous processing while still preserving the pitch information. The new algorithm has a relatively moderate effect on the speech signal. System combination of syncpitch with a baseline system is shown to improve speaker verification accuracy in experiments conducted on the 2002 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation data...|$|R
