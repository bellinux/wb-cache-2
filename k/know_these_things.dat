5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
25|$|Before I {{experienced}} {{the horror of}} that attack, I was quick to call coward or yellow anyone who showed fear under any circumstances. Nevermore. I don’t <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but they speak truth to one. I am not a psychologist, nor a statistician, and less of a philosopher; but the depth of emotion, the dreads of fear, the referees of horrors, and the concentration of self that led me to make this observation, the fear impulse, or perhaps, better said, the (impulses caused) by fear, are stronger, more demanding than either that of love or hunger...|$|E

What shall I say when I am asked: And what did you do during that time?" [...] In the same letter he said, [...] "Since Saturday the Berlin Jews are being rounded up. Then they are sent off with what they can carry.... How can anyone <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and walk around free?" [...] In 1941 von Moltke gave birth to their second son, Konrad, at Kreisau.|$|E

6000|$|John Perkins <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> would happen. And he {{knew that}} at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat, and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone: ...|$|R
60|$|The warriors <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>knew</b> {{them better}} perhaps {{than a simple}} warrior should have known them. And so it was here in the temple that he looked for the aid that he sought in the {{carrying}} out of whatever design he had.|$|R
6000|$|Now, when I, who am {{not paid}} to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> know them daily on the {{evidence}} of my senses and experience; when I know that the Ruffian never jostles a lady in the streets, or knocks a hat off, but in order that the Thief may profit, is it surprising that I should require from those who ARE paid to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> prevention of them? ...|$|E

6000|$|Ah Maria <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things!</b> [...] "That she {{has nothing}} left for {{anything}} else? Of course she hasn't. To {{whom do you}} say it? High-strung? Don't I spend my life, for them, jamming down the pedal? I see moreover how it has told on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He.--And {{you hope}} that <b>these</b> masters will <b>know</b> the grammar, the [...] fables, the history, the geography, the morality, in which they [...] will give her lessons?

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Merrill, still pacing, [...] "two wrongs don't make a right, I admit. I've <b>known</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> a long time, and I've {{thought about}} {{them a good}} deal. But I've had to run along with the tide, or give place to another man who would; and--and starve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys outgrow what is amiss in them? From {{bad boys}} spring good men? Sir, 'the child is {{father of the}} man;' hence, as all boys are rascals, so are all men. But, God bless me, you must <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> better than I; keeping an {{intelligence}} office as you do; a business which must furnish peculiar facilities for studying mankind.

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] the hunter replied, [...] "that it's jest a trick {{to draw the}} Germans out from Bordentown and so away from Trenton. At any rate, it's well that the true account of the force here should be <b>known.</b> <b>These</b> <b>things</b> gets magnified, and they may think that there's a hull army here." ...|$|R

6000|$|When the {{interpreter}} translated this speech {{the king was}} silent {{for two or three}} minutes. Then he said, [...] "My white friend is right, They were foolish men. They could not <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> If my warriors overtake them no harm shall come to them." ...|$|E
60|$|HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you {{any human}} sympathy? Don't you <b>know</b> how <b>these</b> <b>things</b> come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.|$|R

5000|$|Several years later, Orestes, now {{converted}} to Christianity, is prefect of Alexandria.

Some Christians ridicule the thinking that the Earth is a sphere, by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus his opinion he avoids conflict by saying that only God <b>knows</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to know," [...] Jeanne said, [...] "at {{what age}} it becomes my own, {{and how much}} it amounts to. It seems to me that I have a right to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and as you will not tell me, I have written to Monsieur Laplanche." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{the little}} {{children}} of the Ho-don <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> while he who {{claims to be the}} son of Jad-ben-Otho knows them not; and if this proof be not enough, there is more.

6000|$|But Sir Gareth sat {{his horse}} very calmly, and he said: [...] "Messire, I struck your shield for {{to call you}} forth so that I might have speech with you.

60|$|The speaker ceased, {{or rather}} {{suspended}} utterance, and gazed upon {{me with an}} eye of understanding. I held the bottle between our eyes and the fire, indicated with my thumb {{the depth of the}} draught, and shoved it over to him; for was he not Palitlum, the Drinker? Many tales had he told me, and long had I waited for this scriptless scribe to speak of the things concerning Ligoun; for he, of all men living, <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> best.|$|R
25|$|Head-to-head races favor fast starters, and War Admiral's speed {{from the}} gate was well known. Seabiscuit, on the other hand, was a pace stalker, skilled at holding with the pack before pulling ahead with late acceleration. From the {{scheduled}} walk-up start, few gave {{him a chance to}} lead War Admiral into the first turn. Smith <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and trained Seabiscuit to run against this type, using a starting bell and a whip to give the horse a Pavlovian burst of speed from the start.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Lutchester," [...] he began, [...] "I don't {{know that}} you are going to find Pamela exactly all that she might be in the way of amiability and so on.

No offence, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my {{business}} to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Think we can't {{tell the difference}} between the tracks of a led horse and a ridden one? The only times two horses trot close together at an even distance is when one's rider has both bridles, or when they're yoked to a wagon pole. However, I've come to ask if you can throw any light on the matter? You and Jernyngham were partners, in a way, weren't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{thus have}} I in few words showed you {{the grace of}} the Spirit, and how it putteth forth itself towards the saving of the soul.
