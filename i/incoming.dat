5|$|A {{directed}} acyclic graph may be used {{to represent}} a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its <b>incoming</b> edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the season}} began, point guard Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists {{leader in the}} 2010â€“11 season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. The <b>incoming</b> class {{included}} Carlton Brundidge and 2011 Ohio Mr. Basketball point guard Trey Burke. Both Brundidge and Burke were among Scout.com's top 100 players of the 2011 class; Brundidge ranked 98th and Burke ranked 94th. Max Bielfeldt committed to Michigan in April despite his family's ties to the Illinois Fighting Illini. Illinois University's Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. Sai Tummala, who along with Bielfeldt was recruited by Ivy League schools, rounded out the <b>incoming</b> class. Tummala earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk-on candidate for the basketball team.|$|E
5|$|Deserts, both hot and cold, {{play a part}} in moderating the Earth's temperature. This {{is because}} they reflect more of the <b>incoming</b> light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.|$|E
5|$|FIU {{also holds}} many Golden Panther spirit events {{throughout}} the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp {{held in the}} Summer prior to the Fall term for <b>incoming</b> freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a retreat center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other <b>incoming</b> students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants. Panther Camp {{is expected to grow}} in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen who participate are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.|$|E
5|$|FOW (Freshman Orientation Week): Mandatory {{first week}} in the Corps just before school starts in the Fall {{semester}} for <b>incoming</b> freshmen cadets or Fish.|$|E
5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} wavelength as the <b>incoming</b> X-ray. By contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pena, <b>incoming</b> 2015 Republican {{member of}} the Texas House of Representatives from Pasadena, was born in Galveston in 1949 and lived there in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich and the <b>incoming</b> Republican majority's {{promise to}} slow the rate of {{government}} spending conflicted with the president's agenda for Medicare, education, the environment and public health, leading to two temporary shutdowns {{of the federal government}} totaling 28 days.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the average}} GPA of <b>incoming</b> {{students}} was 3.29 out of 4.0. Average composite scores on standardized college-admissions tests were 28 on the ACT (the 92nd percentile) and 1917 on the SAT (the 90th percentile).|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the book}} was {{assigned}} as summer reading for the <b>incoming</b> class of 2019 at Duke University. Several students objected to the book on moral and/or religious grounds.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, <b>incoming</b> Welsh manager Jayne Ludlow {{unveiled}} her squad for the 2015 Istria Cup {{which did}} not feature long-time captain Fishlock. Two months later, she was re-called to the team.|$|E
5|$|In late 2006, Baker {{was named}} to a Budget and Finance working group for <b>incoming</b> Governor Deval Patrick's {{transition}} committee. In 2008, he joined the Public Advisory Board of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics (NHIOP) at Saint Anselm College.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{business}} schools, Tuck encourages its {{students to have}} post-undergraduate work experience before applying to the MBA program. The average <b>incoming</b> student has five years of full-time work experience, and the average student age is 28, ranging from 25 to 32 years.|$|E
5|$|McGill hosts around 500 <b>incoming</b> {{exchange}} {{students from}} over 32 countries. The university offers {{a multitude of}} activities and events to integrate {{the students in the}} university's community as well as to introduce them to the North American academic culture.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, November 7, 2017, Democratic New Jersey Assemblywoman {{and former}} Speaker of the Assembly Sheila Oliver was elected {{lieutenant}} governor under <b>incoming</b> Governor Phil Murphy, and {{will become the}} second Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Saxbe fix {{has become}} {{politically}} uncontroversial. Both Democratic and Republican Presidents {{have used the}} fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H. W. Bush helped Democratic <b>incoming</b> President Bill Clinton execute the fix by signing it into law {{on the eve of}} Clinton's inauguration. The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in both the House and the Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. Outgoing Republican President George W. Bush signed the Saxbe fixes for both Hillary Clinton and Ken Salazar into law for the <b>incoming</b> Democratic Obama administration.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats recaptured the House {{after the}} 1882 elections, but the <b>incoming</b> {{majority}} in the 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker {{more in line with}} their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass the <b>incoming</b> representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.|$|E
5|$|The University Honors Program, {{administered}} by The Burnett Honors College {{is designed for}} 500 accomplished <b>incoming</b> undergraduates annually. Undergraduates enrolled in The Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned {{research in the area}} of a sponsoring faculty member. Another program offered by the college is Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis. The latest Honors College <b>incoming</b> class had an average SAT score of 1373 and a 4.16 grade-point average. Honors students have the option to reside in a specifically designed living-learning community, composed entirely of honors students, in Tower III at Knights Plaza.|$|E
5|$|The <b>incoming</b> {{class had}} no four- or five-star recruits. However, it {{included}} three players that Rivals.com listed as three-star recruits. Only Ben Cronin was also listed as three-star by scout.com.|$|E

5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses {{to the fate of}} neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the <b>incoming</b> tide and <b>incoming</b> landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; {{the outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the <b>incoming</b> X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the <b>incoming</b> X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|A new School of Law {{building}} and parking garage were also {{constructed in the}} 1990s {{as part of the}} revitalization of downtown Newark. Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education, as well as in distance learning, with its renowned Seton World Wide program. In 1998, all <b>incoming</b> full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.|$|E
5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to <b>incoming</b> artillery fire aimed {{at the entrance to}} the inner defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Syracuse University {{began to}} {{transform}} {{into a major}} research institution. Enrollment increased {{in the four years}} after the war due to the G.I. Bill, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous <b>incoming</b> class. Branch campuses were established in Endicott, New York and Utica, New York.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the FOB, 411th Engineer Brigade soldiers commenced construction on other facilities throughout Camp Liberty for other <b>incoming</b> Army units. At the same time, other units in the brigade were responsible for route clearance in the areas of Logistics Support Area Anaconda along routes used for military supply as well as civilian traffic. The brigade's soldiers used Buffalo mine protected vehicles to clear these routes of suspected Improvised Explosive Devices and other dangerous obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played as}} the starter at right tackle {{in each of}} the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but <b>incoming</b> head coach Tom Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle {{position}} before the first preseason game. Allen was originally designated the primary backup at left and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{control of}} the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less {{information}} than the Allies on <b>incoming</b> weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland â€“ {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development â€“ no one {{paid attention to the}} bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the <b>incoming</b> Poles. He predicted {{that it would not be}} long before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Andre Marhold, a {{small forward}} {{and the first}} of two <b>incoming</b> freshmen, signed with Duquesne on April 16. Marhold, a native of Pittsburgh who moved to North Carolina for High School, {{averaged}} 17.0 points and 10.0 rebounds per game his senior year, in which his team was the regular season champion. He was ranked 188 in the top 1000 high school seniors by Hoop Scoop. Marhold turned down scholarship offers from Clemson, Charlotte, and Purdue.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the <b>incoming</b> and {{outgoing}} lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an <b>incoming</b> lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an <b>incoming</b> to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. <b>Incoming</b> sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the <b>incoming</b> light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, {{less than}} 25% {{of the faculty}} had doctorates, and {{in an attempt to}} reach {{university}} status for the school, the 1956 Statement of General Policy on Employment of Faculty stipulated that <b>incoming</b> faculty had to have their doctorates (or soon receive one) in order to be hired. By the end of the 1950s, 56% of permanent faculty had doctorates. By the beginning of 1965 this had increased to 68%.|$|E
