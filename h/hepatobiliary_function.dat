40|$|Background: Pre- or {{reconditioning}} of donor livers {{can improve}} organ quality prior to transplantation. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether metformin as pre- or reconditioning agent is able to reduce preservation injury in rat donor livers and improve <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> during ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Methods: To study the preconditioning effects of metformin, metformin was administered via oral gavage 12 and 2 hours before the hepatectomy. To assess the reconditioning effects of metformin, in 2 other groups, metformin was added to the NMP perfusion fluid in two different concentrations (30 and 300 mg/L). In the reference group, no pre- or reconditioning was carried out. In all groups, rat donor livers were preserved for 4 hours in preservation fluid on melting ice. Thereafter, NMP was performed for viability assessment. Results: Preconditioning improved ATP production and <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> (assessed by total bile production, biliary bilirubin and bicarbonate) and significantly lowered levels of lactate and glucose during NMP. On the other hand, metformin preconditioning did not reduce markers for hepatobiliary injury such as AST, ALT, LDH, caspase- 3 activity, TBARS or biliary gamma-GT and LDH. Reconditioning with metformin did not improve <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> or reduce injury markers during NMP. Conclusion: Preconditioning of rat donor livers with metformin improves <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> but does not reduce preservation injury as assessed during 3 hours of NMP. Reconditioning with metformin showed no beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|Objectives   To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} a procedure for quantifying the hepatocyte-specific uptake of Gd-BOPTA and Gd-EOB-DTPA using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Methods   Ten healthy volunteers were prospectively recruited and 21 patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease were retrospectively evaluated. All subjects were examined with DCE-MRI using 0. 025  mmol/kg of Gd-EOB-DTPA. The healthy volunteers underwent an additional examination using 0. 05  mmol/kg of Gd-BOPTA. The signal intensities (SI) of liver and spleen parenchyma {{were obtained from}} unenhanced and enhanced acquisitions. Using pharmacokinetic models of the liver and spleen, and an SI rescaling procedure, a hepatic uptake rate, K Hep, estimate was derived. The K Hep values for Gd-EOB-DTPA were then studied in relation to those for Gd-BOPTA and to a clinical classification of the patient’s hepatobiliary dysfunction. Results   K Hep estimated using Gd-EOB-DTPA showed a significant Pearson correlation with K Hep estimated using Gd-BOPTA (r[*]=[*] 0. 64; P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in healthy subjects. Patients with impaired <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> had significantly lower K Hep than patients with normal <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> (K Hep[*]=[*] 0. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 05  min- 1 versus K Hep[*]=[*] 0. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 10  min− 1; P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions   A new procedure for quantifying the hepatocyte-specific uptake of T 1 -enhancing contrast agent was demonstrated and used to show that impaired <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> severely influences the hepatic uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA. Key Points   • The liver uptake of contrast agents may be measured with standard clinical MRI. • Calculation of liver contrast agent uptake is improved by considering splenic uptake. • Liver function affects the uptake of the liver-specific contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA. • Hepatic uptake of two contrast agents (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Gd-BOPTA) is correlated in healthy individuals. • This method can be useful for determining liver function, e. g. before hepatic surgery The previous status {{of this article was}} Manuscript and the working titles was Liver Specific Gd-EOB-DTPA vs. Gd-BOPTA Uptake in Healthy Subjects: A Novel and Quantitative MRI Analysis of Hepatic Uptake and Vascular Enhancement and Hepatic Uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA in Patients with Varying Degree of Hepatobiliary Disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{secretion}} of bile is {{the result}} of active hepatocellular transport processes, most of which occur across the canalicular membrane of liver cells. Disturbance of the function and/or expression of these transporters leads to the intracellular accumulation of toxic bile acids, thereby promoting cholestatic liver cell injury. Genetically determined alterations of <b>hepatobiliary</b> transporter <b>function</b> are increasingly recognized as important risk factors for an individual's susceptibility to develop cholestasis. It has become evident that, besides the established pathogenic role of mutations in canalicular transporter genes in progressive and benign forms of familial intrahepatic cholestasis, genetics may also {{play an important role in}} acquired cholestatic syndromes, such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy or drug-induced cholestasis.

40|$|Purpose—The {{suitability}} of fexofenadine as a probe substrate to assess <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>function</b> in humans was evaluated by pharmacokinetic modeling/simulation and in vitro/in situ studies using chemical modulators. Methods—Simulations {{based on a}} pharmacokinetic model developed to describe fexofenadine disposition in humans were conducted to {{examine the impact of}} altered hepatobiliary transport on fexofenadine disposition. The effect of GF 120918 on fexofenadine disposition was evaluated in human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). Additionally, the effect of GF 120918, bosentan, and taurocholate on fexofenadine disposition in perfused livers from TR − Wistar rats was examined. Results—Based on modeling/simulation, fexofenadine systemic exposure was most sensitive to changes in the hepatic uptake rate constant, and did not reflect changes in hepatic exposure due to altered hepatic efflux. GF 120918 did not impair fexofenadine biliary excretion in SCH. GF 120918 coadministration significantly decreased Cl’biliary to 27. 5 % of control in perfused livers. Conclusions—Simulations were in agreement with perfused liver data which predicted changes in fexofenadine systemic exposure primarily due to altered hepatic uptake. Fexofenadine is not a suitable probe to assess hepatic efflux function based on systemic concentrations. GF 120918 -sensitive protein(s) mediate fexofenadine biliary excretion in rat liver, whereas in human hepatocytes multiple efflux proteins are involved, in fexofenadine hepatobiliary disposition...|$|R

40|$|Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was {{performed}} on 13 healthy beagle dogs to determine whether percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in the dog was a feasible and safe procedure. Clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic examinations were done at 0 and 10 minutes, in the 2 nd and 16 th hour, and on the 7 th day. They included a detailed physical examination of the mucous membranes, cardiorespiratory system and abdominal organs. Laboratory examinations of the blood consisted of a complete blood count, determination of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), total plasma protein (TPP), parameters of haemostasis including prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), and enzyme activities reflecting <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function,</b> i. e. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Ultrasonographic findings of the gallbladder (size, shape, wall, content) and appearance of the biliary tract and the surrounding cranial intraabdominal organs were also evaluated. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis {{was performed}} easily during the study, and dogs tolerated well the procedure performed without anaesthesia. All laboratory parameters of the blood remained within normal limits throughout the study. However, some follow-up values, i. e. PCV, TPP, APTT and ALT, demonstrated statistically significant differences when compared to baseline measurements, which might reflect the effect of 24 -hour fasting before the experiment, as well as day-to-day metabolic fluctuations due to feeding and water supply during the study. There were no visible signs of bleeding from the liver, bile leakage from the gallbladder or accumulation of free peritoneal fluid during repeated ultrasonographic examinations. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis seems to be an important diagnostic procedure in canine gallbladder diseases and can be used safely and easily to gain gallbladder bile for diagnosis of bacterial cholecystitis or for investigating <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> in the dog...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the utility of}} non-invasive assessment of <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> by 99 mTc-mebrofenin cholescintigraphy in a rat model of diet-induced steatosis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (250 - 300 g) were fed a standard methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for up to 5 weeks, thereby inducing hepatic fat accumulation, progressive inflammation and fibrogenesis corresponding with clinical steatosis. 99 mTc-mebrofenin pinhole scintigraphy {{was used to evaluate}} the hepatocyte mebrofenin uptake rate, the time of maximum hepatic uptake (T(peak)) and the time required for peak activity to decrease by 50 % (T(1 / 2 peak)). Scintigraphic parameters were correlated with biochemical and serological parameters and with liver histopathology. RESULTS: MCD diet induced mild steatosis after 1 week and severe steatosis with prominent inflammation after 5 weeks. T(peak), T(1 / 2 peak) prolonged and the uptake rate decreased significantly, while the severity of steatosis increased (p < 0. 05). There was a strong, significant correlation between the severity of steatosis (histopathology, hepatic triglyceride content) and the 99 mTc-mebrofenin uptake rate (r 2 = 0. 83, p < 0. 0001 and r 2 = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001, respectively). In addition, the uptake rate correlated significantly with the increased inflammation (plasma and hepatic TNF-alpha, r 2 = 0. 72, p < 0. 0001 and r 2 = 0. 52, p= 0. 001, respectively). The correlation of the uptake rate with hepatocellular damage was weak (AST and ALT, r 2 = 0. 29 and 0. 32, respectively), but correlation with synthetic function was strong (prothrombin time, r 2 = 0. 70, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> assessed by 99 mTc-mebrofenin scintigraphy correlates with the extent and progression of steatosis.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the liver is the production of bile and the biliary secretion of endogenous and exogenous substances, including drugs and drug metabolites. Bile formation is a complex sequence of cellular events, which involves uptake of bile constituents and xenobiotics on the basolateral (sinusoidal) plasma membrane of hepatocytes and secretion of cholephilic compounds across the apical (canalicular) membrane. These uptake and efflux processes are maintained by distinct transport systems expressed at the two polar surface domains of liver cells. Any functional disturbance of these canalicular transport systems can lead to cholestatic liver disease, which is associated with intracellular accumulation of toxic bile constituents and consecutive cholestatic liver cell damage. Interaction of drugs with hepatobiliary transport systems is increasingly recognized as cause of acquired cholestatic syndromes. Thereby, genetically determined alterations of <b>hepatobiliary</b> transporter <b>functions</b> are important risk factors for an individual's susceptibility to develop cholestasis. Especially, mutations in canalicular transporter genes can cause certain forms of hereditary cholestatic liver disease, including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. In addition, systematic genetic screenings have discovered numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms in hepatobiliary transporter genes that lead to amino acid exchanges in the encoded proteins. However, the functional consequences and the clinical relevance of most of these polymorphisms remain to be defined. This overview summarizes the physiological <b>function</b> of human <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport systems and discusses {{the impact of their}} genetic variations for the pathophysiology of cholestatic syndromes and the pharmacogenetics of drug-induced cholestasis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Orlistat, an {{intestinal}} lipase inhibitor, {{has recently}} {{been approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of obesity. The effects of orlistat on <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> have not been previously defined. A 4 wk study was performed involving modest weight loss in obese subjects to observe any short-term hepatobiliary responses that occur after initiating treatment with orlistat and a hypocaloric diet. METHODS: A total of 23 obese (BMI 30 - 41 kg/m 2) subjects were randomized to a double blind t. i. d. treatment with 120 mg of orlistat or a placebo in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet (1200 - 1500 kcal/day). The study was designed to achieve similar modest weight loss in both groups {{in order to be able}} to directly assess the effects of orlistat. Cholesterol saturation, bile composition, and gallbladder motility were measured. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment period, mean weight loss of 3. 8 kg was achieved in the orlistat group (vs 2. 3 kg with placebo, p = NS). Total bile acid concentration decreased significantly with placebo (- 18. 57 ± 6. 99 mmol/L; 95 % CI = - 32. 26 to - 4. 87), but not with orlistat. Biliary phospholipid concentration decreased significantly with placebo (- 4. 38 ± 1. 91 mmol/L; 95 % CI = - 8. 13 to - 0. 64) but not with orlistat. Mean changes from the baseline in cholesterol saturation index and gallbladder motility were similar in both groups. Microscopy of bile failed to reveal cholesterol microcrystals before or after treatment in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a primary initial effect of weight loss is a reduction in biliary bile acids and phospholipids. Orlistat blocks these adverse changes in biliary lipid composition and maintains <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function.</b> We speculate that the risk of formation of gallstones during weight loss may actually be lowered with orlistat. © 2001 by Am.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis deals {{with the role of}} nuclear receptors in transcriptional control and function of transporters involved in the generation of bile. Bile formation {{is one of the major}} functions of the liver. Membrane transport proteins that primarily determine bile formation are located at the basolateral (uptake) and canalicular (secretion) membrane domains of hepatocytes. The last step in hepatobiliary transport, i. e., the secretion of the major bile constituents such as bile salts, phospholipids and cholesterol into the canalicular lumen, is mediated by ABC transporter proteins which couple ATP hydrolysis to transport and thereby enable uphill transport. Cholestasis refers to the condition in which the formation of bile is impaired. The causes underlying the development of cholestasis in patients can be extremely varied. It may occur through interference with canalicular secretion from the hepatocyte by drugs or toxins or due to genetic defects in specific transporters. Recently, it has become clear that nuclear receptors play a prominent role in the transcriptional control of transporter genes, but also of genes involved in bile salt, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Dietary compounds, certain endogenous metabolites and drugs may alter hepatic transporter activity, and thus bile formation, through activation of these nuclear receptors. The aim of this thesis was to define the role of a number of such nuclear receptors in control of <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>function.</b> Most data published thus far are from in vitro studies and their relevance for the in vivo situation has remained largely unknown. Therefore, we have studied the in vivo effects of different nuclear receptors, specifically of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), the liver X receptor (LXR) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), on the expression of hepatic transporters and their physiological consequences on bile formation. Furthermore, the overall effects on the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts and on cholesterol transport have been evaluated. ...|$|R
40|$|Sulfobromophthalein (BSP) is used {{to study}} <b>hepatobiliary</b> {{excretory}} <b>function.</b> BSP is conjugated with glutathione (GSH), whereas its dibrominated analog disulfobromophthalein (DBSP) is not conjugated with GSH prior to biliary excretion. In addition, both BSP and DBSP are transported into hepatocytes via organic anion–transporting polypeptides and excreted into bile via multidrug resistance–associated protein 2 (Mrp 2). Nuclear factor erythroid 2 –related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a transcription factor that under basal conditions is targeted for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol by kelch-like ECH–associated protein 1 (Keap 1). Electrophilic and oxidative stress facilitate Nrf 2 nuclear translocation and subsequent induction of cytoprotective genes, including GSH synthetic enzymes, GSH-S-transferases (Gsts), and Mrp transporters. The current study determined whether varying the amount of Nrf 2 activation would effect the elimination of BSP and DBSP. Male wild-type (WT), Nrf 2 -null, and Keap 1 -knockdown (Keap 1 -kd) mice were administered BSP or DBSP. Within 30 min, Nrf 2 -null mice excreted 25 %, WT mice 52 %, and Keap 1 -kd mice 80 % of the injected BSP. Liver GSH content was not altered by BSP. The biliary excretion of GSH and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of major Gsts were directly proportional {{to the amount of}} Nrf 2. Moreover, BSP-GSH conjugation activity in the liver of Nrf 2 -null and Keap 1 -kd mice was 42 % and 237 % of WT mice, respectively. In contrast to BSP, there were no differences in biliary excretion or plasma disappearance of DBSP among the three genotypes, suggesting that the modest differences in Mrp 2 mRNA expression among genotypes do not affect BSP or DBSP biliary excretion. Collectively, these results indicate that increased biliary excretion of BSP, and possibly other compounds, is due to Nrf 2 -induced Gst mRNA expression and enzyme activity...|$|R

Methods: For this study, the researchers prospectively reviewed the charts of 154 sickle cell disease patients who had been treated in Salmaniya Medical Complex hospital in Bahrain between September 2013 and December 2014. Results: The results obtained showed that 95 % of patients had sickle cell hemoglobin type. Of the sample patients, 80 % exhibited bone pain, with all patients exhibiting bone crisis. Biochemical tests revealed reduced hemoglobin concentration, elevated bilirubin, compromised liver function, and lower white blood cell counts. The incidence of hepatitis B and C was very low, at 0 % and 9 %, respectively. There were a large number of hospital admissions, with 11 days as an average length of stay. The most common ultrasound findings in this study were hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, cholelithiasis, gallbladder sludge, and splenomegaly. Conclusion: Sickle cell disease had profound negative effects on multiple organs, with a particularly large number of complications related to the hepatobiliary system.

40|$|Background: Areca nut {{has been}} {{listed as a}} {{carcinogenic}} agent in humans and is linked to cancers of oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and <b>hepatobiliary</b> system. Liver <b>function</b> tests (LFTs), the estimation of enzymes specific to the hepatic system, give an assessment of its cellular integrity, and functionality. Aim and Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate {{the state of the}} liver in patients consuming areca nut and its products over a period. Materials and Methods: LFTs were carried out on 10 nonareca nut chewers and thirty patients with a history of areca nut, quid or a combination of tobacco and areca nut chewing, extending from 6 months to 30 years. The LFTs included estimation of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), direct bilirubin, albumin, and total protein content. A comparative analysis was done for each biochemical marker with duration, form (betel nut alone, quid, and betel nut with tobacco), and frequency of chewing areca nut. Results: A mild increment in AST was seen in 33. 3 % cases. Statistically significant association (P < 0. 05) was observed between the control and cases for AST, ALP, and total protein content. A significant positive Pearson's correlation (+ 0. 417) was obtained for a form of areca nut chewing (areca nut and tobacco) and AST. A significant negative Pearson's correlation (− 0. 05) was observed between total protein content and form of chewing (areca nut and tobacco). Conclusion: The results of the study seem to indicate that even long-term chewing of areca nut is not hepatotoxic. Minor alterations in LFTs were well within limits...|$|R
40|$|Pregnancy and {{contraceptive}} steroids {{are associated}} with a raised incidence of cholesterol gall stone disease. In pregnancy there is an increase {{in the size of the}} gall bladder. Investigation of <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> in man and mammals has not established if the enlarged gall bladder is simply dilated, or if the absorptive capacity of the mucosa has changed. In the present study the concentrating function of the gall bladder and bile secretion from the liver were studied in pregnant animals, oophorectomised animals and animals treated for three months with contraceptive steroids. The effects of intravenous administration of prolactin, progesterone and oestrogen were studied in oophorectomised animals. It was found that the net rate of water absorption in the gall bladder of pregnant animals was doubled, while oophorectomy and contraceptive steroids did not affect this variable. The volume outflow of bile was enhanced in pregnant animals and in animals treated with contraceptive steroids. Intravenous infusions of prolactin, oestrogen or progesterone were found not to influence gall bladder concentrating function, nor hepatic bile secretion in oophorectomised animals...|$|E
40|$|Chlorinated dibenzodioxins {{have been}} found as {{contaminants}} of various technical chlorinated compounds such as 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4, 5 -T), which are widely used in agriculture. The dioxin contaminants {{may be involved in}} various pathologic states resulting from exposure to technical chlorinated compounds (1, 2). Liver necrosis has been observed in the animals which were treated with derivatives of chlorophenol (3) or other chlorinated compounds (4), and it was suggested that liver necrosis-causing factors were present in these compounds. In view of the above observation, the present study was undertaken to investigate whether 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachloro-pdibenzodioxin (TCDD) has any effect on the <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> of rat. Biliary excretion of indocyanine green (ICG) was used as the index of function. The dye was chosen because it is completely and rapidly excreted by normal liver into the bile by an active process (5).

40|$|International audienceA {{dynamic model}} based on {{ordinary}} differential equations that describes uptake, basolateral and canalicular export of taurocholic acid (TCA) in human HepaRG cells is presented. The highly reproducible inter-assay experimental data {{were used to}} reliably estimate model parameters. Primary human hepatocytes were similarly evaluated to establish a mathematical model, but with notably higher inter-assay differences in TCA clearance and bile canaliculi dynamics. By use of the HepaRG cell line, the simultaneous TCA clearance associated to basolateral uptake, canalicular and sinusoidal efflux, was predicted. The mathematical model accurately reproduced the dose-dependent inhibition of TCA clearance in the presence and absence of the prototypical cholestatic drugs cyclosporine A (CsA) and chlorpromazine. Rapid inhibition of TCA clearance and recovery {{were found to be}} major characteristics of CsA. Conversely, the action of chlorpromazine was described by slow onset of inhibition relative to inhibition of TCA clearance by CsA. The established mathematical model, validated by the use of these 2 prototypical cholestatic drugs and the integration of bile canalicular dynamics, provides an important development for the further study of human <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function,</b> through simultaneous temporal and vectorial membrane transport of bile acids in drug-induced cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme (DME) {{induction}} is {{an adaptive}} response associated {{with changes in}} preclinical species; this response can include increases in liver weight, hepatocellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and upregulated tissue expression of DMEs. Effects of DME induction on clinical pathology markers of <b>hepatobiliary</b> injury and <b>function</b> in animals as well as humans are not well established. This component of a multi-part review of the comparative pathology of xenobiotically mediated induction of hepatic metabolizing enzymes reviews pertinent data from retro-spective and prospective preclinical and clinical studies. Particular attention is given to studies with confirmation of DME induction and concurrent evaluation of liver and/or serum hepatobiliary marker enzyme activities and histopathology. These results collectively indicate that in the rat, when histologic findings are limited to hepatocellular hypertrophy, DME induction {{is not expected to}} be associated with consistent or substantive changes in serum or plasma activity of hepatobiliary marker enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyltransfer-ase. In the dog and the monkey, published studies also do not demonstrate a consistent relationship across DME-inducing agents and changes in these clinical pathology parameters. However, increased liver alkaline phosphatase or gamma glutamyltransferase activity in dogs treated with phenobar-bital or corticosteroids suggests that direct or indirect induction of select hepatobiliary injury markers can occur both in the absence of liver injury and independently of induction of DME activity. Although correlations between tissue and serum levels of these hepatobiliary markers are limited and inconsistent, increases in serum/plasma activities that are substantial or involve changes in other markers generally reflect hepatobiliary insult rathe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades many studies have been devoted to the {{involvement}} of the periportal (zone- 1) and perivenous (zone- 3) hepatocytes in bile formation and hepatobiliary transport of endogenous and exogenous compounds. It became clear that such a heterogeneity in transport function can, in principle, be due to the different localization of the cells in the acinus with respect to the incoming blood, to intrinsic differences between the cells or to both. In this review we first discuss the techniques used to study hepatocyte heterogeneity in <b>hepatobiliary</b> transport <b>function.</b> Combinations of such techniques can be used to discriminate between cellular heterogeneity due to acinar localization as opposed to intrinsic differences. These techniques include: normal and retrograde perfusions of isolated perfused livers; autoradiographic, fluorimetric and histochemical localization of injected substrates; separation of isolated hepatocytes into fractions enriched in periportal and perivenous cells; measurements of fluorescent surface signals with microlight guides; selective zonal toxicity, and pharmacokinetic modelling and analysis. Subsequently, for each of the rate-limiting steps in the hepatobiliary transport of organic compounds, the basic mechanisms are summarized and the available knowledge on the involvement of the cells from the various zones in these transport steps is discussed. The available literature data indicate that heterogeneity in transport function is often due to the localization of the cells in the acinus: the periportal cells are the first to come into contact with the portal blood and are thus exposed to the highest substrate concentration. Consequently they obtain the most prominent task in further disposition of the particular compound. It follows that the extent of involvement of the perivenous cells in drug disposition is implicitly determined by the activity of the periportal cells. Because of the potential saturation of elimination processes in the periportal cells, the involvement of perivenous cells may vary with the input concentration. In addition, real intrinsic differences have been established in the hepatobiliary transport of some substrates. These are probably based on differences in the cellular content of carrier- and receptor-binding and/or metabolizing proteins. In some cases these intrinsic differences may be secondary to existing sinusoidal gradients of endogenous compounds, such as O 2, amino acids, bile acids or monosaccharides. Yet, data on the heterogeneity of hepatocytes in the various transport steps are far from complete or are even totally lacking, especially for human liver. A multi-experimental approach and advanced technology will be needed in the future to gain more insight into the acinar organization of bile formation and hepatobiliary transport of drugs in the human...|$|R
40|$|Gallstones {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{digestive}} diseases with an estimated prevalence of 10 %- 15 % in adults living in the western world, where cholesterol-enriched gallstones represent 75 %- 80 % of all gallstones. In cholesterol gallstone disease, the gallbladder becomes the target organ of a complex metabolic disease. Indeed, a fine coordinated <b>hepatobiliary</b> and gastrointestinal <b>function,</b> including gallbladder motility in the fasting and postprandial state, is of crucial importance to prevent crystallization and precipitation of excess cholesterol in gallbladder bile. Also, gallbladder itself plays a physiopathological role in biliary lipid absorption. Here, we present a comprehensive view on the regulation of gallbladder motor function by focusing on recent discoveries in animal and human studies, and we discuss the role of the gallbladder in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation. (HEPATOLOGY 2008; 47 : 2112 - 2126.) Gallstones are one the most common gastrointestinal diseases that require hospitalization in the western world, 1 and this is a true health burden 2 - 4 with enormous costs estimated at 6. 5 billion dollars each year in United States. 4, 5 Because life expectancy and the incidence rate of obesity are both rising worldwide, 6 the incidence rate of gallstones may increase, often in the context of the “metabolic syndrome”. 7 The estimated prevalence of gallstones is 10 %- 15 % in the general population of developed countries. In the United States, approximately 20 million to 25 million adults have gallstones. The burden of the disease is highest (60 %- 70 %) in American Indians followed by Hispanics of mixed Indian origin. In contrast, the rate is lowest (les...|$|R
40|$|Despite being decked as {{the most}} prized {{compounds}} in the nugget box of contrast agents for clinical radiologists, and carrying an indisputable tag of safety of the US Food and Drug Administration for close to three decades, all may not be seemingly well with the family of gadolinium compounds.

The toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GBCAs, however, has come under hawk-eyed scrutiny with recent reports that gadolinium tends to deposit cumulatively in the brain of patients with normal <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> and intact blood–brain barrier. While the jury on the long-term hazard significance of this critical scientific finding is still out, the use of GBCAs must be guided by due clinical diligence, avoidance of repeated doses, and preferring GBCAs with the best safety profiles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bile duct injury after {{hepatic artery}} {{thrombosis}} (HAT) in liver transplantation {{is believed to}} be caused by ischemia predominantly. We aimed to define the involvement of bile secretory dysfunction in the pathogenesis of liver injury after HAT. METHODS: In a murine model, the main hepatic artery, the extrahepatic peribiliary plexus, or both arterial connections to the liver were interrupted (n= 5 for each group). After 1, 14, or 28 days, <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function</b> was assessed by analysis of bile transporter expression, serum bile acids and bilirubin, and hepatic ATP content. In addition, cellular injury was assessed by light microscopy and biochemical markers. RESULTS: There were no signs of hepatobiliary dysfunction or injury in sham-operated animals or in mice with interruption of the hepatic artery or the extrahepatic peribiliary plexus alone. However, as early as 24 hr after complete dearterialization, bile transporter expression was significantly reduced and intrahepatic cholestasis started to progress the following weeks. Histologic studies at 28 days after complete dearterialization showed severe hepatobiliary injury. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that arterial blood supply is critical for normal bile secretion. Bile duct injury after complete arterial deprivation is preceded by a loss of bile secretory function and subsequent intrahepatic cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{derived from}} heme oxygenase {{has recently been}} shown {{to play a role}} in controlling <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function,</b> but intrahepatic distribution of the enzyme is unknown. We examined distribution of two kinds of the heme oxygenase isoforms (HO- 1 and HO- 2) in rat liver immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that distribution of the two isoforms had distinct topographic patterns: HO- 1, an inducible isoform, was observed only in Kupffer cells, while HO- 2, a constitutive form, distributed to parenchymal cells, but not to Kupffer cells. Both isoforms were undetectable in hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Of the two isoforms, HO- 2 in the parenchymal cell rather than HO- 1 in the Kupffer cell, appears to play a major role in regulation of microvascular tone. In the perfused liver, administration of HbO 2, a CO-trapping reagent that can diffuse across the fenestrated endothelium into the space of Disse, elicited a marked sinusoidal constriction, while administration of a liposome-encapsulated Hb that cannot enter the space had no effect on the microvascular tone. These results suggest that CO evolved by HO- 2 in the parenchymal cells, and, released to the extrasinusoidal space, served as the physiological relaxant for hepatic sinusoids...|$|E
40|$|Background/objective: Outcomes of {{treatment}} for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain poor worldwide. Among patients with MDR-TB in Belarus who started treatment in 2012, only 54 % completed it successfully, with treatment failure reported in 22 % of the patients; additionally, 11 % died and 13 % were lost to follow-up or remained unevaluated. In Belarus, to improve outcomes, bedaquiline was introduced in MDR-TB treatment in June 2015. The national TB program developed measures to monitor safety and effectiveness of bedaquiline-containing regimens {{in line with the}} World Health Organization recommendations. Methods: After enrollment of patients, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and microbiological data were carefully collected at start, during treatment, and at follow-up. A total of 197 patients were enrolled: male, 140 (71 %); female, 57 (29 %); new TB cases, 83 (42 %); previously treated, 114 (58 %); extensively drug-resistant-TB (XDR-TB), 128 (65 %), pre-XDR-TB (fluoroquinolone resistant), 34 (17 %), pre-XDR-TB (injectables resistant), 25 (13 %), and other MDR-TB cases, 10 (5 %). Results: According to the intermediate analysis, 186 patients currently are continuing with the treatment, two patients died, and nine patients were lost to follow-up. Sputum culture conversion were observed in 186 patients (94 %) at 6 months and one (0. 5 %) of these 197 patients started treatment; six patients (3 %) remain sputum culture positive. The safety data were as follows: 135 patients (68 %) experienced metabolism and nutrition disorders (hyperuricemia being the most common), 127 patients (64 %) experienced <b>hepatobiliary</b> disorders (hepatic <b>functions</b> abnormality being the most common), 93 patients (47 %) experienced electrolyte disorders (hypomagnesemia being the most common), 80 patients (41 %) experienced cardiac disorders (abnormal electrocardiogram and arrhythmia being the most common), 68 patients (35 %) experienced gastrointestinal system disorders (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain being the most common disorders), 54 patients (27 %) experienced blood and the lymphatic system disorders (low platelet count being the most common), 42 patients (21 %) experienced renal and urinary disorders (creatinine clearance decrease being the most common), 40 patients (20 %) experienced nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness, and paresthesia being the most common ones), 36 patients (18 %) experienced skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (rush and pruritus being the most common), 35 patients (17 %) experienced ear and labyrinth disorders (tinnitus and decreased hearing being the most common ones), 32 patients (15 %) experienced psychiatric disorders (insomnia being the most common disorder), and 30 patients (14 %) experienced infections and infestations (candidiasis being the most common). The most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and reversible. One death was possibly related to MDR-TB therapy. Conclusion: Our interim results on safety and effectiveness of bedaquiline-containing regimens in multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) patients are encouraging. They will add value to understanding role and place of this new anti-TB drug in M/XDR-TB treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the mechanisms of}} hepatobiliary injury in the lithocholic acid (LCA) -fed mouse, an increasingly used model of cholestatic liver injury. Swiss albino mice received control diet or 1 % (w/w) LCA diet (for 1, 2, and 4 days), followed by assessment of liver morphology and ultrastructure, tight junctions, markers of fibrosis and key proteins of <b>hepatobiliary</b> <b>function,</b> and bile flow and composition. As expected LCA feeding led to bile infarcts, which were followed by a destructive cholangitis with activation and proliferation of periductal myofibroblasts. At the ultrastructural level, small bile ducts were frequently obstructed by crystals. Biliary-excreted fluorescence-labeled ursodeoxycholic acid accumulated in bile infarcts, whereas most infarcts did not stain with India ink injected into the common bile duct; both findings are indicative of partial biliary obstruction. Expression of the main basolateral bile acid uptake proteins (sodium-taurocholate cotransporter and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1) was reduced, the canalicular transporters bile salt export pump and multidrug-related protein 2 were preserved, and the basolateral transporter multidrug-related protein 3 and the detoxifying enzyme sulfotransferase 2 a 1 were induced. Thus, we demonstrate that LCA feeding in mice leads to segmental bile duct obstruction, destructive cholangitis, periductal fibrosis, and an adaptive transporter and metabolic enzyme response...|$|E

Ten men and three women with pulmonary tuberculosis were subjected to hepatobiliary scintigraphy at the beginning of triple treatment (M 1) and two months after it (M 2). Patients were from the urban area, of low socioeconomic level, malnourished, and chronic alcohol and/or tobacco users. Ten normal individuals were evaluated as controls. Radiotracer images were acquired on a computerized gamma camera (Orbiter-Siemens) and T 1 / 2 uptake and excretion values were calculated. Nutritional status and serum hepatic enzyme levels for each patient were evaluated at M 1 and M 2. None presented clinical or laboratory antecedent of hepatobiliary disease. At M 1, there were no hepatic serum or kinetic alterations of the 99 mTc-DISIDA. At M 2, patients presented better nutritional conditions than at M 1; there was increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and reduced excretion time for 99 mTc-DISIDA, which was interpreted as a more adaptive than toxic phenomenon, yet not all alterations were significant and none manifested clinically. Apparently, triple treatment acted on the liver inducing the P 450 cytochrome enzymatic system, accelerating radiotracer excretion, which follows the same path as the bilirubins...|$|E
