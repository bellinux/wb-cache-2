5|$|The cave temples, {{numbered}} 1 to 4 in {{the order}} of their creation, in the town of Badamithe capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas)are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579CE). The inscription, written in the old Kannada language, has enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{original}} Lone Tree had long disappeared, <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Merrick county had not forgotten its historical significance. In 1911, they erected a granite monument.

In 1911, there were also two <b>dedications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument, one on August 9, 1911 and a second rededication of it on July 3, 2011.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{standard}} spelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surname as [...] "Shakespeare" [...] was {{the most}} common published form in Shakespeare's lifetime, but it was not one used in his own handwritten signatures.

It is also the spelling used in the First Folio, <b>the</b> definitive collection <b>of</b> his plays published in 1623, after his death.|$|R

5|$|The city of Arlington {{celebrated its}} centennial in 2003 with a parade, a festival honoring the city's history, {{sporting}} events, and musical and theatrical performances. The centennial celebrations {{culminated in the}} <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> $44 million Arlington High School campus, attended by an all-class reunion of the old school. In 2007, the city of Arlington renovated six blocks of downtown's Olympic Avenue {{at a cost of}} $4.4 million, widening sidewalks, improving street foliage, and adding new street lights. The project was credited with helping revitalize the city's downtown, turning Olympic Avenue into a gathering place for residents and a venue for festivals.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Blue Water {{was built to}} house workers and their {{families}} in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation {{and at one point}} had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plaque.|$|E
50|$|Azes II is also {{connected}} to the Bimaran casket, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha. The casket, probably Greek work, was used for <b>the</b> <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> a stupa in Bamiran, near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, and placed inside the stupa with several coins of Azes II. This event may have happened during <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Azes (35-12 BCE), or slightly later. The Indo-Scythians are otherwise connected with Buddhism (see Mathura lion capital and <b>the</b> multiple Buddhist <b>dedications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apracas), and it is indeed possible they would have commendited the work. However it now thought that a later king, issuing coins in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Azes, such as Kharahostes, made the dedication.|$|R

5|$|Bloet was a royal {{clerk in}} the {{household}} of King William I of England. He accompanied William I's son, William Rufus, when Rufus traveled to England to claim the throne after William I's death. Rufus named Bloet as chancellor by January 1091, but then named Bloet to the See of Lincoln in March 1093 {{after the death of}} Remigius de Fécamp. Bloet was appointed {{at the same time that}} Anselm was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, during a severe illness when Rufus feared he was dying. Bloet was consecrated at Hastings not long before 22 February 1094, probably on 12 February the day after the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church at Battle Abbey. By 19 March 1094 he had been replaced as chancellor by William Giffard.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{became the}} third President of West Georgia College in 1961 after William H. Row {{died of a}} heart attack. Boyd is most known for his {{peaceful}} racial integration of the campus (without waiting for a court order) in 1963 by inviting a young black woman, Lillian Williams, to attend the college; she eventually earned two degrees in education and in 1985 received the college's highest honor, the Founder's Award. In May 1964, Boyd invited Robert F. Kennedy to the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, which was named after Robert's brother, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in November 1963. During his visit, Robert Kennedy promoted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was then under debate in the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Ingram's wife Lillian died in May 1951, and on 24 December of {{the same}} year he married another widow, Myrtle Lydia Thomas (née Cornell), in a {{ceremony}} at Brunswick Methodist Church; the couple later had a son, Alex. In 1954, Ingram attended the <b>dedication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shrine of Remembrance by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 February following an expansion on the monument to encompass Australia's contributions to the Second World War. Two years later, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross. On 30 June 1961, Ingram died of coronary vascular disease at his home in Hastings, Victoria, and was buried at Frankston Cemetery. He is commemorated by a street name in Canberra.|$|E
