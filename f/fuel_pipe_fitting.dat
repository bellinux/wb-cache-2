5000|$|In 1977, Edward Storie {{sold the}} Fittings plant in Oshawa another [...] "Manchester of Canada" [...] operation, the Pedlar People Limited and Graeme Kirkland. Edward Storie was {{retained}} {{at the site}} as general manager. The entire operation was renamed to [...] "Pedlar Industrial Incorporated". On 30 June 1978, the new management announced that Fittings would close operations, due to competition from imported materials and plastic <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings.</b> The plan was to close operations on 8 September 1978 putting approximately 200 people out of work. Subsequent demonstrations by unemployed workers were unsuccessful in reopening operations. Kirkland was quoted as saying, [...] "It will take several months to replace this volume (<b>pipe</b> <b>fittings)</b> but the decision to discontinue <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> will strengthen the foundry operation in the future." [...] At the time, <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> represented 25% of manufacturing volume of the factory.In 1982, amid high interest rates and global steel shortages, Pedlar Industrial Inc., which included the Fittings operations, was forced into receivership.|$|R

40|$|High-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> is an {{important}} component of the fuel injection system of diesel engine, it suffer complex loading from engine. The fatigue life of <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> has great impact on reliability of engine. In this study, the fluid-solid coupling model which considers the action of fuel is established. Analysis on the effect of fuel’s pressure oscillation on the mode is carried out. Through the simulation comparisons, the mode frequency and mode shape of each model are all analysed. Base on the fluid-solid coupling model, frequency response analysis is done to study the reliability of high-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe.</b> The results show that the pressure oscillation of fuel has important influence on the mode frequency. The maximum Stress Tensor and Vibration Velocity appeared at the position of first order mode frequency.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} results of {{fieldwork}} research {{on the effect of}} <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> on particle accumulation in a drinking water network (DWN). The term, affected section of <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> (ASPF) is introduced, which is the length of pipe beyond the <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> where the temporal deposition/erosion processes of particles, due to the daily hydraulics, leads to higher concentrations of particles on the pipe walls. The lengths of the ASPF were calculated to be 5. 31 – 299. 40 m. In order to quantify the mass of particles washed out of fire-hydrants, the resuspension potential method (RPM) or uni-directional flushing (UDF) program, were performed on four different DWNs (populations < 10 000 – 700 000; network length: 20 – 1374 km; DN 100 – DN 250 mm). The flow and turbidity during flushing was measured with online instruments. A relation was found between the concentration of total solids (TS) analysed from grab samples and the turbidity measured with online equipment: 1 NTU = 0. 303 mg/l (n = 63). The turbidity potential of accumulated particles for the ASPF was suggested as coefficient (J) and varied from 1. 02 – 3. 74. The total mass of particles accumulated in either the ASPF or straight sections varied from 0. 57 – 7. 14 g/m (n = 24) and 0. 46 – 5. 79 g/m (n = 21), respectively. Therefore, <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> have greater amounts of dry mass compared with straight sections of pipe, which {{can be explained by the}} inertial effects of <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings...</b>|$|R

The total mass of particles accumulated in either <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> affected sections or straight sections varied from: 0. 062 – 5. 46 g/m (n= 22) and 0. 058 to 3. 61 g/m (n= 22). To quantify the mass of washed out particles the resuspension potential method (RPM) or uni-directional flushing (UDF) program were performed in four different drinking water networks (DWN) with population from < 10 000 – 700 000; network length: 20 - 1374 km; DN 100 – DN 250). The flow and turbidity during flushing was measured with online instruments. There was found relation between concentration of total solids (TS) measured from grab samples and turbidity 1 NTU= 0. 2854 mg/l (n= 63). The turbidity potential of accumulated particles for PODDS model was determined J= 1. 01 - 2. 54.
