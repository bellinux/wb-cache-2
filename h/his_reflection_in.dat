5|$|The genus {{appeared}} {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 24 million years ago, in the Iberian peninsula. While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with <b>his</b> <b>reflection.</b> <b>In</b> the English language the common name Daffodil appears to be derived from the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking <b>his</b> <b>reflection,</b> <b>in</b> the form of a crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

40|$|The article aims at {{developing}} {{an analysis of}} some Merleau-Ponty’s thesis concerning art, perception and ontology, and takes freely the cue from <b>his</b> <b>reflections.</b> <b>In</b> a nutshell, it argues that the creative significance of expression is deeply linked to an essential process, namely the {{process in which the}} human body becomes an image...|$|R
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a waterfall pool.|$|E

25|$|In Casino Royale, novelist Ian Fleming has René Mathis, one of James Bond's fictional fellow secret agents, make {{a remark}} about Bond looking like Hoagy Carmichael. Later in the novel, {{after looking at}} <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a mirror, Bond disagreed. However, Fleming and Carmichael also shared a resemblance.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> those mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{elements}} were suggested by other staff members, with Robert Wolfe naming Colonel Anastasia Komananov and Behr changing Suzie Luvsitt to Mona Luvsitt. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was later not pleased with the James Bond-style approach, and when Bashir's spy program appeared in the later episode [...] "A Simple Investigation", the references were more generic. Dennis Madalone managed to save some time during the production {{as one of the}} shots involved Bashir seeing Falcon approach him from behind by seeing <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a bottle of champagne. After time was already scheduled to attempt the shot, Madalone explained to the director that he could take the filmed sequence and digitally manipulate it onto the bottle. Madalone was also responsible for firing a cork from a bottle at Colm Meaney's head from off screen to make it appear as if Bashir did it, and managed to do it on the first take.|$|E

500|$|At the October 2014 New York Comic Con, {{footage from}} {{the series was}} shown. In January 2015, a motion film poster was {{released}} {{to coincide with the}} revealing of the streaming date for the first season. The following month, on February 4, a teaser trailer was released. Merrill Barr of Forbes noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to DC Comics' Arrow and different from Marvel's ABC series, but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after Super Bowl XLIX, especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for [...] or Ant-Man and could have benefited from introducing [...] "its latest and riskiest show" [...] to general audiences through it. In March 2015, an additional motion poster was released, which featured all major characters and Avengers Tower in the background of the poster, as well as the possible reveal of Murdock's red suit in <b>his</b> <b>reflection.</b> <b>In</b> the lead up to the first-season premiere, a street marketing campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals. On April 2, 2015, the series had its premiere at the Regal Premiere House at L.A. Live where the first two episodes were previewed.|$|E
500|$|... "River Card" [...] {{is based}} on a Puerto Rican short story {{entitled}} [...] "There’s a Little Coloured Boy at the Bottom of the River". The story tells of a boy who falls in love with <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> a river, believing it is another person, similar to the Greek myth of Narcissus. Cox attempted to capture [...] "this childhood homoerotic energy…I remember experiencing and relating to." [...] In the conclusion of the story, the boy jumps into the water and drowns, thus making [...] "River Card" [...] "a song about a dead child." [...] The lyrical contents of [...] "Quarantined" [...] were inspired by a Russian article Cox read about children born with AIDS, confined in hospitals due to the [...] "various lifestyles and mistakes" [...] of their parents. [...] Cox, who has a genetic condition known as Marfan syndrome, related the article to his own experiences with children's hospitals. [...] Having had many chest and back surgeries when he was sixteen, he [...] "got real used to children's hospitals", finding them [...] "kind of haunted, weird places." [...] "On Guard" [...] is described as [...] "a sad song", the lyrics of which illustrate having to age and dealing with the [...] "newfound anxiety" [...] that comes with meeting new people. Cox explains that this anxiety stems from lacking [...] "the energy to represent yourself to people. You’re always on guard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Man {{carefully}} {{observed the}} creation of nous and received from God man's authority over all creation. Man then rose up above the spheres' paths {{in order to better}} view creation. He then showed the form of the All to Nature. Nature {{fell in love with the}} All, and man, seeing <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> water, fell in love with Nature and wished to dwell in it. Immediately, man became one with Nature and became a slave to its limitations, such as gender and sleep. In this way, man became speechless (having lost [...] "the Word") and he became [...] "double", being mortal in body yet immortal in spirit, and having authority over all creation yet subject to destiny.|$|E

2500|$|Liu Bei {{had been}} holding a grudge against Zhang Yu since the {{incident}} in Fu County, so he became angrier when he heard that Zhang Yu was predicting his downfall, and decided to take revenge against Zhang Yu. He accused Zhang Yu of making an inaccurate prediction about the Hanzhong Campaign, imprisoned him, and wanted to execute him. When Zhuge Liang pleaded with Liu Bei to spare Zhang Yu, Liu Bei said, [...] "When something blocks your doorway, {{even if it were}} pretty flowers, you'll {{have to get rid of}} it." [...] As Zhang Yu was well-versed in physiognomy, every time he saw <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the mirror he grew weak and collapsed, because he knew he would die by execution. Zhang Yu was subsequently executed by beheading and his body was dumped into the street.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon <b>his</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E

He confessed later: [...] "...the war was a meeting ... with the Absolute." [...] In 1916, he wrote his first essay: La Vie Cosmique (Cosmic life), where his scientific and philosophical thought was revealed just as his mystical life. He pronounced his solemn vows as a Jesuit in Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon, on May 26, 1918, during a leave. In August 1919, in Jersey, he would write Puissance spirituelle de la Matière (The Spiritual Power of Matter).|$|R
