The feedstock consisted of poultry waste made into slurry of four solids concentrations (SC); 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 %. The starting hydrogen ion concentrations (pH) of the slurries used in the study were, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Two digestion temperatures; 30 and 35 o C were used during this investigation.
