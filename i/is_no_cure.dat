5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for Alzheimer's disease; {{available}} treatments offer {{relatively small}} symptomatic benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments {{can be divided}} into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for polio. The {{focus of}} modern {{treatment}} {{has been on}} providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. Supportive measures include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet. Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.|$|E
5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a respirator. Otis {{suggests}} that they might find supplies at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b> COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b> Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} train, Sinclair's group are arrested by {{soldiers}} armed with archaic weapons and armor. They {{are taken to}} a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, {{the rest of the}} group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2010, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for MMND. [...] People with MMND {{are given}} {{supportive}} care {{to help them}} cope, which can include physical therapy, occupational therapy, counselling, and hearing aids.|$|R
5000|$|Although [...] "there has <b>been</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> {{of chronic}} hypersomnia", {{there are several}} {{treatments}} that may improve patients' quality of life, depending on the specific cause or causes of hypersomnia that are diagnosed.|$|R
25|$|In October 1818, Nancy Hanks Lincoln {{contracted}} milk sickness {{by drinking}} milk of a cow that had eaten the white snakeroot plant. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for the poison and on October 5, 1818, Nancy died.|$|R
5|$|Ajax kidnaps her {{and takes}} {{her to a}} {{decommissioned}} helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him rescue Vanessa. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but reveals that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> after Deadpool overpowers him. Despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills Ajax, though he promises to try and be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry at Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for HD. Full-time care is {{required}} in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide {{is the cause of}} death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.|$|E
50|$|Gillis Duncan {{caused the}} {{apprehension}} of Barbara Naper for bewitching to death Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus. Archibald {{was reported to}} have died from a disease so strange there could <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> or remedy.|$|R

50|$|In 1936 rabies {{appeared}} in Ovamboland. For the medical workers this was depressing, as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> {{for those who}} were ill with it, and the patients were in great pains before the finally expired.|$|R
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons {{continue to be}} lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally {{for all individuals}} without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} {{can help}} control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 {{percent of cases}} can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|By the 1890s, most {{accepted}} that leprosy existed in Louisiana, {{that no one}} knew how the disease was transmitted, and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b> The many uncertainties led to the idea of establishing a home to confine the lepers in.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>cures</b> for FHS. Close {{monitoring}} {{of growth in}} the first few years is essential, as well as annual general health screening and tests listed below. An FHS diagnosis will affect the individual and those there to support them.|$|R

[...] There are various approaches to managing neurogenic bladder dysfunction, physical therapy and mobility aids {{to help with}} walking, and dementia can be managed with occupational therapy, counseling and drugs.|$|R
5|$|This {{causes a}} power flicker in the Hub; Ianto makes {{an excuse to}} look into it himself and finds Tanizaki's body. As he leaves Lisa to hide the body, she drains even more power by {{re-entering}} the conversion unit. Believing the Hub is under attack, team leader Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) sends Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to the basement where they find the abandoned conversion unit. Jack runs down to find Owen unconscious and Gwen about to be converted. He stops the process and attempts to shoot Lisa, but Ianto stops him, allowing Lisa to escape. Ianto pleads with Jack that they try to save her, but Jack affirms that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure.</b>|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for HD, {{but there}} are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse that turns humans into fiends. Believing that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja {{and one of the}} DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E
