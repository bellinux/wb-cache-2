5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to metal detectors, X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|The Madonna {{was first}} {{restored}} in 1905. By then the statue's core was riddled with woodworm tunnels {{and threatened to}} collapse. The restorers carefully wrapped the statue in a plaster cast, insufflated the cavities to remove bore dust, impregnated them with insecticides and finally filled them {{with a mixture of}} glue, chalk and water, turning the figure around repeatedly in the process so as to reach <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> angle. The surface holes were then sealed with bolts of oak. The restoration cost a total of 3,200 Goldmarks, part of which was paid by the Prussian state.|$|E
500|$|Reception to Hair {{upon its}} Broadway premiere was, with exceptions, {{overwhelmingly}} positive. [...] Clive Barnes {{wrote in the}} New York Times: [...] "What is so likable about Hair...? [...] I think it is simply {{that it is so}} likable. [...] So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions." [...] John J. O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was [...] "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny of the Biltmore Theater". Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that [...] "it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist." ...|$|E

60|$|Though {{leaving the}} Cape behind us, the severe cold still continued, {{and one of}} its worst {{consequences}} was the almost incurable drowsiness induced thereby during the long night-watches. All along the decks, huddled between the guns, stretched out on the carronade slides, <b>and</b> in <b>every</b> accessible <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner, you would see the sailors wrapped in their monkey jackets, in a state of half-conscious torpidity, lying still and freezing alive, without the power to rise and shake themselves.|$|R
500|$|Many of D'Angelo's peers {{have noted}} {{the success of the}} [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video as a {{contributing}} factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work, as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour. A columnist for SoulBounce.com has cited the video as the [...] "jump-the-shark moment" [...] for D'Angelo, and stated [...] "It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it, least of all him". Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, who served as producer for Voodoo and musical director for [...] "The Voodoo Tour", discussed the music video's impact on D'Angelo in a 2003 interview with music journalist Touré, stating [...] "he wants is to get fat. He doesn’t want his braider braiding <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny of his hair. He doesn’t wanna have to have ripples in his stomach.

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny of the character, {{in a way you}} don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny." ...|$|E

Being so slim, he could go where any of his four-footed neighbors could, and it wasn't long before he knew all about <b>every</b> hole <b>and</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner anywhere around.

It reached No. 17 on Billboard's Top Contemporary Christian Albums chart. In 2010, HM Magazine listed Whitecross No. 29 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that [...] "listen to this album. It'll blow your mind.

60|$|Weeks passed away, {{but still}} the dark cloud of sorrow hung over Fort Chimo, for the merry young voice that was wont to awake the {{surrounding}} echoes was gone. The systematic search had now been given up, for <b>every</b> <b>nook,</b> <b>every</b> glen, <b>and</b> gorge, and corrie within fifteen miles of the spot where they had found the little sledge, had been searched again and again without success. But hope clung with singular tenacity to the parents' hearts long after it had fled {{from those of the}} men of the fort and of the Esquimaux. Every alternate day Stanley and Frank sallied forth with heavy steps and furrowed brows to explore more carefully those places where the child was most likely to have strayed, expecting, yet fearing, to find her dead body. But they always returned to the bereaved mother with silent lips and downcast looks.|$|R

Life has been able to adapt and spread into <b>every</b> planetary <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny. At this point in history, life is becoming able to engineer itself, with extreme consequences we are only dimly able to foresee. One probable outcome will be the facilitation of the expansion of the range of life to beyond our planetary cradle, an evolutionary step as profound as the ancient transition from sea to land. Current efforts at NASA and aboard the International Space Station will be discussed in this context...|$|R
60|$|Like {{the great}} world, this little {{microcosm}} has its gradations of rank and style and importance. The Premier, or first floor, with its grand saloons, lofty ceilings, and splendid furniture, is decidedly the aristocratical {{part of the}} establishment. The second floor is scarcely less aristocratical and magnificent; the other floors go on lessening in splendor as they gain in altitude, and end with the attics, the region of petty tailors, clerks, and sewing-girls. To make the filling up of the mansion complete, <b>every</b> odd <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner is fitted up as a joli petit appartement à garçon (a pretty little bachelor's apartment), that is to say, some little dark inconvenient nestling-place for a poor devil of a bachelor.|$|R
2500|$|... …Significant too is {{that from}} the early 1800s the Finnish seamen sailing these ships had journeyed {{up and down the}} North and South American coasts. Salt, used by the Company in {{preserving}} pelts, was obtained on islands in Baja California. Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, just north of San Francisco, was a stop on that route until 1841 when the fort was sold to the [...] "swindler" [...] Johann Sutter, on whose land the first California Gold was found. Thus, all Finnish seamen plying these waters knew <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> cranny on these shores. Similarly they knew equally well the coast on the Asiatic side.

2500|$|..... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, of this city, {{have been}} a source of {{enormous}} outlay, but the result is an equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly imagine that he is in the halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished off with an abundance of gilt. The appearance of the main saloon is really charming. Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, just waiting to spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which are of the very costliest kind. The whole of the furniture in the grand saloon and ladies' saloon is covered in plum colored velvet, while that of the social hall is done in velvet and rep, each having a very beautiful effect on the surroundings ...|$|E
2500|$|Pt Madan Mohan Malayia was a {{very good}} friend of Master Lyallpuri. He had {{suggested}} to Master Lyallpuri that Akali should start one of their own English newspaper so that the Akal agenda and voice could reach <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> corner of India. Accordingly, the 'Managing Board' of The Akali newspaper held a meeting under chairmanship of Lyallpuri and decided to found an English daily. The Board assigned the task to Master Lyallpuri and S Mangal Singh Gill. However, the move received a setback when Lyallpuri was arrested under section 124 'O' for writing what the English Government thought was objectionable material in The Akali. On release from jail, Lyallpuri resumed the efforts and put an advertisement in The Akali asking for donations for five Lakhs from Sikh Sangat. In response, the Punjabi fans of Master Lyallpuri from Stockton (USA) immediately wired Rs 150,000. Another Rs 70,000 was contributed by local Sikh community with the efforts of Lyallpuri. S Mangal Singh Gill and Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jullundur) were made in charge of the newspaper. Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya and Master Tara Singh were members of the Managing Committee. K. S. Panikar was its first Editor. Devdas Gandhi was also on the editor's panel. The Managing chairman and Chief Patron was Master Lyallpuri himself. The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 15 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, Delhi [...] (Now: Swami Sharda Nand Marag). It was very unfortunate for the Sikhs that due to lack of experience, and jealousy and betrayal of the fellows like Master Tara Singh and S. Mangal Singh Gill, as well as due to lack of viable financial resources, the Hindustan Times soon came into severe grip of financial crisis so that its ownership had to be sold to Pt Madan Mohan Malayia. Even Pt Malayia could not keep it running for long and [...] he sold it to G. D. Birla. The sale of the ownership of the Hindustan Times had caused a great mental anguish to Lyallpuri. Master Lylallpuri has personally written that: [...] "S. Mangal Singh and [...] Co. torpedoed my aim of nationalism and of Hindu-Sikh-Muslim-Christian unity. They rather gave it a communal twist, so the Akalis had to part company with Hindustan Times; and this also caused winding up of the Sikh Center at Delhi which I had established with so much fondness and hard labour ...|$|E
60|$|Still no {{one knew}} of this. Unless the {{household}} found it out when she was not there--and they all held Mr Dombey's rooms in awe--it was as deep a secret in her breast as what had gone before it.

It was a somewhat lonely spot at the foot of tall cliffs, not far from which the shattered hull of a small brig lay jammed between two rocks. Tommy Bogey stood beside him, and both man and boy gazed long and silently at the wrack which lined the shore. <b>Every</b> <b>nook,</b> <b>every</b> crevice <b>and</b> creek {{at the foot of the}} cliff was filled choke full of broken planks and spars, all smashed up into pieces so small that, with the exception of the stump of a main-mast and the heel of a bowsprit, there was not a morsel that exceeded three feet in length, and all laid side by side in such regular order by the swashing of the sea in and out of the narrower creeks, that it seemed as if they had been piled there by the hand of man.|$|R

60|$|We {{drank the}} soup, {{but we did}} not eat the bread. Not that we were not hungry, and not that the bread was uneatable. It was fairly good bread. But we had reasons. My cell-mate had {{discovered}} that our cell was alive with bed-bugs. In all the cracks and interstices between the bricks where the mortar had fallen out flourished great colonies. The natives even ventured out in the broad daylight and swarmed over the walls and ceiling by hundreds. My cell-mate was wise in the ways of the beasts. Like Childe Roland, dauntless the slug-horn to his lips he bore. Never was there such a battle. It lasted for hours. It was shambles. And when the last survivors fled to their brick-and-mortar fastnesses, our work was only half done. We chewed mouthfuls of our bread until it was reduced to the consistency of putty. When a fleeing belligerent escaped into a crevice between the bricks, we promptly walled him in with a daub of the chewed bread.
