5|$|McEntire {{was a guest}} {{judge on}} the July 13, 2016 episode of America's Got Talent. She used her golden buzzer, which she could only use once and allowed an act to <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the live shows, on contortionist Sofie Dossi.|$|E

5|$|East of 21st Street–Queensbridge, {{before the}} IND 63rd Street Line {{connects to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line, the tracks veer left while the tunnel wall goes straight. The bellmouths {{were part of a}} {{proposed}} super-express bypass running under the LIRR mainline between Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills. This plan was not in the original Second System plan, but rather, as part of the Program for Action plan that had the tracks from 21st Street–Queensbridge <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Forest Hills.|$|E

5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out enough to <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E
25|$|George {{was invited}} to be a guest judge on America's Got Talent in 2016. He was allowed to use his golden buzzer once, which made an act <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the live shows. He used his on the dance group Malevo.|$|E

25|$|Hip Hop music {{producer}} S-X who {{has worked}} with T.I., J. Cole, Birdman & Lil Wayne was born and raised and still lives in Wolverhampton. In 2010, Wolverhampton-born singer Liam Payne came third in the British television music show The X Factor with his boy band One Direction, who in March 2012 became the first British group to <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the top of the US music charts with their debut album, Up All Night.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Williams {{had been}} on {{maternity}} leave for three months while pregnant with daughter Susan, and assumed she would <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> work on the film Athena when she returned. However, production started without her, and the studio cast Jane Powell in the lead role, rewriting much of the premise that Williams and writers Leo Pogostin and Chuck Walters had come up with. The studio moved her to Jupiter's Darling. Two more films were planned, Bermuda Encounter and Olympic Venus, about the first Olympic swimmers; however, these were never made.|$|E

25|$|In late September 2003, the SkyPier {{high-speed}} ferry terminal opened. Passengers {{arriving at}} the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their ride back to the PRD. Passengers travelling both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports – Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) – were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau can complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the boarding gate for the flight at HKIA.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Warner Independent Pictures {{acquired}} the North American rights and Pathé the international rights to distribute Slumdog Millionaire theatrically. However, in May 2008, Warner Independent Pictures was shut down, {{with all of}} its projects being transferred to Warner Bros., its parent studio. Warner Bros. doubted the commercial prospects of Slumdog Millionaire and suggested that it would <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> DVD without a US theatrical release. In August 2008, the studio began searching for buyers for various productions, to relieve its overload of end-of-the-year films. Halfway through the month, Warner Bros. entered into a pact with Fox Searchlight Pictures to share distribution of the film, with Fox Searchlight buying 50% of Warner Bros.'s interest in the movie and handling US distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} slated {{for an early}} 2006 release through Columbia Records. However, most of the personnel who backed them at the label were fired {{during the process of}} recording the album, making them opt to change their label. Instead, the band signed to The Firm Music, a division of the band's management company The Firm, Inc., in an effort to avoid typical record labels and <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> distributors. Beyond the label switching, Patrick commented further delay was caused by personal commitments, such as members' families getting married and having children. During this time, they also opted to replace the album's original mix with ones done by sound engineer Ken Andrews. They were able to fit this into their schedules because they used Andrew's Pro Tools set-up at his house, rather than renting time at a high-budget studio.|$|E

25|$|Another example {{cited by}} Biskind was Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American (2002), whose release Weinstein delayed {{following}} the September 11 attacks owing to audience reaction in test screenings to the film's critical tone towards United States past foreign policy. After being told the film would <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> video, Noyce planned to screen {{the film in}} Toronto International Film Festival in order to mobilize critics to pressure Miramax to release it theatrically. Weinstein decided to screen the film at the Festival only after he was lobbied by star Michael Caine, who threatened to boycott publicity for another film he had made for Miramax. The Quiet American received mostly positive reviews at the festival, and Miramax eventually released the film theatrically, but it was alleged that Miramax {{did not make a}} major effort to promote the film for Academy Award consideration, though Caine was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{statistics}} {{showed that}} of all Swedes aged 25–64, 15% have completed only compulsory education (as {{the highest level of}} attainment), 46% only upper secondary education, 14% only post-secondary education of less than three years, and 22% post-secondary education of three years or more. Women are more educated than men (26% of women vs. 19% of men have post-secondary education of three years or more). The level of education is highest among those aged 25–34, and it decreases with age. Both upper secondary school and university studies are financed by taxes. Some Swedes <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> work after secondary school. Along with several other European countries, the government used to subsidize tuition of non-EU/EEA students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, but in 2010 they started charging non-EU/EEA students 80,000–100,000 SEK per year. Swedish fifteen year old pupils have the 22nd highest average score in the PISA assessments, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{civil work}} is {{dealt with by}} either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or tort case valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any legal question likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to hear any case of judicial review.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a Power Pellet is eaten; starting at stage 19, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction. There are also fruits, located directly below the centre box, that appear twice per level; eating it will result in bonus points (100-5,000).|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{reportedly}} {{said the}} film would probably <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> DVD. It made over $300million in worldwide box office receipts.

You know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs.
