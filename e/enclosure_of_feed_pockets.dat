50|$|Nests of B. atratus are {{circular}} {{in shape}} and have been observed to have a diameter of around 10-30 cm and a height of between 10-20 cm. For those nests found on the ground, the brood comb is usually located in slight cavities a couple of centimeters below ground level. The number of nest entrances varies {{and seems to be}} unrelated to any specific property of the colony, such as size. Although most nests usually have multiple entrances, one or two are more active than the others. All nest entrances are subject to intentional modifications by the workers that use the entrance. B. atratus also have the tendency <b>of</b> forming pollen <b>feeding</b> <b>pockets</b> that are attached to larval clusters to facilitate the larval feeding process.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an experimental study conducted {{in order to}} determine the supply hole discharge coefficients of externally pressurized gas bearings. Tests were carried out on annular orifices and simple orifices with <b>feed</b> <b>pocket.</b> Air consumption and pressure distributions were measured as a function of supply pressure and air gap height for several different orifice and pocket sizes. Discharge coefficients were approximated by an experimental formula based on the Reynolds number and feeding systems geometry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Exact {{computation}} of {{the workload}} distribution {{is relevant to}} find parameters for quality of service demands. We present a method <b>of</b> obtaining verified <b>enclosures</b> <b>of</b> discrete time GI/GI/ 1 workload distributions using a polynomial factorization approach and interval arithmetic. Muller’s and Bauhuber’s techniques for a numerical computation of the roots of real polynomials are employed and their results serve as starting points for obtaining the <b>enclosures</b> <b>of</b> the roots using a polynomial root finder with result verification. Based on these intervals we finally compute the <b>enclosure</b> <b>of</b> the probability function. We conclude with some detailed exam-ples and a brief look at further works. Key-Words:- GI/GI/ 1 workload distribution, quality of service, result verification, <b>enclosure</b> <b>of</b> complex roots...|$|R
