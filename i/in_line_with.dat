Almost every line ultimately adopts group incentives. However, problem-solving teams are found almost exclusively <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> more complex production processes. Consistent with these patterns, fixed-effects models reveal increased productivity under group incentives <b>in</b> all <b>lines,</b> while teams raise productivity <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> more complex production processes. This evidence indicates that teams give workers a valuable opportunity to solve problems in more complex production processes, while standard operating procedures appear to suffice elsewhere. ...|$|R

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds have a {{tocopherol}} profile {{dominated by}} alpha-tocopherol. The {{objective of this}} research was to study the dynamics of tocopherol accumulation <b>in</b> sunflower <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> altered total tocopherol content or tocopherol profile. Developing seeds were sampled at regular intervals <b>in</b> two <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> reduced and increased total tocopherol content, respectively, and six <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> modified tocopherol profiles. The <b>line</b> <b>with</b> reduced tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate reduced by half, whereas the <b>line</b> <b>with</b> increased tocopherol content showed a tocopherol accumulation rate twofold higher than the control. In the three cases, alpha-tocopherol followed a sigmoid accumulation pattern. Modified tocopherol profiles were expressed at early stages of tocopherol accumulation. <b>In</b> most <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> modified profiles, tocopherol accumulation pattern differed from the alpha-tocopherol <b>lines,</b> <b>with</b> maximum tocopherol content at 18 or 21 days after flowering (DAF) that was reduced to reach a plateau from 33 or 36 DAF onward. Such a reduction was caused by continued dry matter accumulation after tocopherol accumulation ceased or slowed down. <b>In</b> <b>lines</b> <b>with</b> increased levels of beta-tocopherol or both gamma- and delta-tocopherol, the synthesis of beta- and delta-tocopherol started and stopped earlier than the synthesis of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, respectively. © 2013 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.
