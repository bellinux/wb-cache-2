P., Stamford, CT, USA Background and objective: <b>Hydrocodone</b> <b>bitartrate</b> {{extended}} release (Hysingla® ER, HYD) {{was previously}} studied in a 12 -week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 52 -week open-label safety study. Both of these preapproval studies allowed dose titration to efficacy. The {{purpose of the}} present analysis was to compare dosing and utilization patterns in these previous clinical trials with real-world data (RWD) usage in a retrospective claim analysis performed 12 – 14  months post approval in the US. Methods: In the claim analysis (Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Database), patients prescribed HYD between January 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, were followed for up to 6  months of continuous HYD use. Daily average consumption (DACON), initial dose, rescue opioid use and total milligram dose over time were also evaluated. Results: HYD daily dose stabilized at ~ 60  mg dose once daily across all three studies. There was also a reduced need for rescue medication with HYD, resulting in a lower total opioid milligram dose over time. In the claim analysis, the mean monthly HYD dose increased from 49 to 55  mg in month 2 and then remained stable through month 6. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time on drug was 79. 5  days (61. 42  days), and DACON was 1. 04  pills/day, corresponding to the approved full prescribing information (FPI) and once-daily dosing. Conclusion: In 12 – 14  months post approval, real-world dosing and utilization of HYD mirrored registration and open-label study findings, with stable once-daily dosing of ~ 60  mg and no increase in rescue medicine utilization.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of Vicoprofen, Ibuprofen, and a placebo on the responses of endogenous opioid peptides following eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage 36 healthy men (age: 22. 8 years; height: 178. 8 6. 2 cm; body mass: 78. 9 13. 7 kg; body fat: 15. 8 6. 5 %) volunteered to participate in the study. Each participant was evaluated for pain 24 h post and randomly assigned to an experimental group: VIC (Vicoprofen), IBU (Ibuprofen), or P (placebo). Medication was given four times daily (i. e., VIC (<b>hydrocodone</b> <b>bitartrate</b> 7. 5 mg with Ibuprofen 200 mg) and IBU 200 mg). Blood was obtained at rest and at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h following the eccentric exercise damage protocol. No significant changes for B-END were observed in the resting values over the recovery period among any of the treatment conditions. Conversely for plasma P-F, VIC and IBU had significantly (P < 0. 05) higher plasma concentrations of P-F above placebo at 24, 48, 72, and 96 and 120 h with VIC higher than IBU and placebo conditions at 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. Significant resting elevations were observed for P-F from pre-exercise at 48, 72, 96, and 120 h for VIC; at 72 and 96 h for IBU and no changes in the placebo treatment. Less tissue damage (MRI analyses), improved physical function as well as reduced pain was observed for the VIC condition over IBU and placebo. These data indicate that exogenous medications appear to be differentially stimulating the peripheral (adrenal medulla) opioid neuroendocrine responses as measured by plasma concentrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeA single-entity, once-daily, extended-release {{formulation}} of <b>hydrocodone</b> <b>bitartrate</b> (HYD) {{has been developed}} {{for the management of}} moderate to severe chronic pain. Hydrocodone undergoes cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) -mediated metabolism involving the CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 D 6 isozymes. CYP 3 A 4 yields norhydrocodone, a major inactive metabolite, whereas CYP 2 D 6 yields hydromorphone, a minor active metabolite. This study examined the influence of the coadministration of paroxetine, a strong selective CYP 2 D 6 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetic properties of hydrocodone (and hydromorphone) in healthy adults. MethodsIn this randomized, double-blind, 2 -period, 2 -treatment crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received paroxetine 20 mg or placebo once daily for 12 days and an HYD 20 -mg tablet on day 10 of each period. FindingsHydrocodone mean Cmax and t½ and median Tmax values were similar with paroxetine or placebo coadministration (16. 8 vs 15. 9 ng/mL, 8. 5 vs 8. 4 hours, and 18. 0 vs 18. 0 hours, respectively), as were mean AUC 0 –t and AUC 0 –∞ values (342. 9 vs 325. 3 ng · h/mL and 346. 3 vs 328. 5 ng · h/mL). The 90 % CIs of the geometric mean ratios of the hydrocodone AUC and Cmax values were fully within the predetermined range of 80 % to 125 %, suggesting that there was no effect of multiple doses of paroxetine on systemic exposure to hydrocodone. Mean hydromorphone AUC 0 –t and Cmax values were decreased with paroxetine versus placebo (0. 64 vs 3. 8 ng · h/mL and 0. 06 vs 0. 19 ng/mL), whereas Tmax values remained similar (18. 0 vs 16. 1 hours, respectively). The mean hydromorphone AUC 0 –∞ value could not be calculated. Both regimens were well tolerated; after HYD administration, the numbers of adverse events were similar between the 2 treatment regimens, and all adverse events were mild. ImplicationsIn this study, the coadministration of single-dose HYD with paroxetine at steady state did not alter systemic exposure to hydrocodone, suggesting that HYD can be coadministered with CYP 2 D 6 inhibitors at therapeutic doses, without dosage modification...|$|E

Setting: The {{study was conducted in}} a contract research center. Participants: The study included healthy adults. Interventions: In a three-way crossover study, Study 1, participants received the following treatments: (A 1) a single dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 7. 5 / 325 mg one tablet, followed by one tablet every 12 hours (q 12 h); (B 1) a single dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 7. 5 / 325 mg two tablets, followed by two tablets q 12 h; (C 1) a single dose of IR HB/APAP 7. 5 / 325 mg two tablets (one tablet at hours 0 and 6), followed by one tablet q 6 h. In a two-way crossover study, Study 2, participants received the following treatments: (A 2) an initial dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 7. 5 / 325 mg three tablets, followed by two tablets q 12 h; (B 2) three doses of IR HB/APAP 7. 5 / 325 mg one tablet q 4 h, followed by one tablet q 6 h. Main outcome measures: PK values were compared, and adverse events were assessed. Results: Single-dose and steady-state area under the concentration–time curves for hydrocodone and APAP were similar for IR/ER and IR HB/APAP; the steady-state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) at steady state were also similar, but single-dose Cmax for hydrocodone was lower for IR/ER HB/APAP. For most PK parameters, 90 % confidence intervals for geometric least squares mean ratios were not meaningfully different (80 %– 125 %). Steady state was achieved in 2 - 3 days for IR/ER HB/APAP and in 2 days for IR HB/APAP. Median time to Cmax was longer for IR/ER HB/APAP versus IR HB/APAP (P< 0. 05). Adverse events were similar across treatments. Conclusion: PK outcomes and tolerability were similar for IR/ER HB/APAP and IR HB/APAP.
