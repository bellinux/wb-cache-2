Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E
60|$|The {{shortness}} of the thicker ones at the angles is {{induced by the}} greater depth of the enlarged capitals: thus the 36th shaft is 10 ft. 4-1/3 in. in circumference at its base, and 10 ,, 0-1/2[103] in circumference under the fillet of its capital; {{but it is only}} 6 ,, 1-3/4 high, while the minor <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts,</b> of which the thickest is 7 ,, 8 round at the base, and 7 ,, 4 under capital, are yet on the average 7 ,, 7 high. The angle shaft towards the sea (the 18th) is nearly of the proportions of the 36th, and there are three others, the 15th, 24th, and 26th, which are thicker than the rest, though not so thick as the angle ones. The 24th and 26th have both party walls to bear, and I imagine the 15th must in old time have carried another, reaching across what is now the Sala del Gran Consiglio.|$|E

50|$|A saildrive is a {{transmission}} system for a boat whose inboard engine has a horizontal output shaft. The saildrive's input shaft is therefore also horizontal.

50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
50|$|In {{the shaft}} the {{ventilation}} was natural, being {{due to the}} higher temperature underground than above ground. The general tendency of the air-current was down the shaft {{to the bottom of}} the mine, and up through the various winzes (<b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts)</b> to the adit level. The open end of this had been connected to a sloping wooden chimney on the hillside, by which means the draught was increased.|$|E

Dr Le Neve Foster was therefore of the opinion that this door should be closed if possible in order that the body of Robert Kelly could be brought up.|$|E

50|$|Where the {{differential}} is not {{located in the}} center line of the vehicle, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> can be fitted to maintain equal length drive shafts on each side. This keeps drive shaft angles equal {{on both sides and}} helps prevent steering irregularities and vibration.The outer end of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> is supported by a bearing secured to the transaxle case and a universal joint assists with alignment.In some cases a longer drive shaft is used on one side.

5000|$|Even {{when the}} driving and driven shafts are at equal angles {{with respect to}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> if these angles are greater than zero, {{oscillating}} moments are applied to the three shafts as they rotate. These tend to bend them in a direction perpendicular to the common plane of the shafts.

The <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> will also have a sinusoidal component to its angular velocity, which contributes to vibration and stresses.|$|R

50|$|To {{begin with}} the Class XIII H had a boiler with a firebox located above the frame. This was made from three boiler rings, the third one being {{slightly}} conical in shape. The boiler feedwater was supplied through two steam injectors and a Knorr feedwater pump with preheater. The second injector was later omitted. The steam engine was configured as a three-cylinder system with simple steam expansion. Two cylinders were located in the usual horizontal position on the outside, the third cylinder was built between the frame sides at an angle. All three cylinders drove the second coupled axle. The gearing of the inside cylinder was operated from the Heusinger valve gear of the outside cylinders via levers and <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{fracture}} of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> in a transmission was analyzed by finite element method. The solid model has advantages of centrifugal force and spin softening effects over beam models. The {{results show that}} the fatigue {{fracture of}} the shaft is mainly due to the torsional vibration,the stress stiffening and spin softening have strong influence on the bending vibration medes,and torsional vibration modes do not changed at different speeds. There is accounting for the effects by an adjustment of the stiffness matrix. By using of solid models,the vibration modes of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> were researched,then the model was optimized in order to avoid resonance...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic {{stick-slip}} friction is {{a well-known}} phenomenon in which the relative motion between two parts involved is intermittent. The relative motion due to external excitation, support compliance of the parts in contact, {{and the difference between}} the static and kinetic friction coefficients contribute to this cyclic stick-slip motion. This paper presents a study on how various vehicle parameters affect the stick-slip vibration in the slider joint between steering <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b> The vibration was simulated using a full vehicle ADAMS model for a maneuver where the vehicle is braking while negotiating a sharp corner. The steering subsystem, which was elaborated in ADAMS/PRE templates for this particular issue, consists of the steering wheel, the steering column, the pinion input shafts, the upper and lower <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b> The cornering and braking event generates the relative velocity and the torque between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts,</b> which are the most important contributing factors leading to the cyclic friction. The simulation was able to duplicate the stick-slip vibration observed in road tests...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{prognostic}} {{method is}} presented for fault detection in gears and bearings in wind turbine drivetrains. This method {{is based on}} angular velocity measurements from the gearbox input shaft and the output to the generator, using two additional angular velocity sensors on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts</b> inside the gearbox. An angular velocity error function is defined and compared in the faulty and fault-free conditions in frequency domain. Faults can be detected from {{the change in the}} energy level of the frequency spectrum of an error function. The method is demonstrated by detecting bearing faults in three locations: the high-speed shaft stage, the planetary stage and the intermediate-speed shaft stage. Simulations of the faulty and fault-free cases are performed on a gearbox model implemented in multibody dynamic simulation software. The global loads on the gearbox are obtained from a dynamometer test bench and applied to the numerical gearbox model. The method is exemplified using a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox. The case study results show that defects in the high- and intermediate-speed bearings can be detected using this method. It is shown that this procedure is relatively simple, yet accurate enough for early fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 101 - 110 The {{design and}} {{application}} of solid couplings combined with flexible quill shafts for high speed turbocompressors are presented. Solid couplings are rigid in the axial direction. They transmit any residual thrust from one compressor casing to another, and even into the gear. A single thrust bearing then positions the complete rotor train. Elimination of individual thrust bearings results in a smaller lube-oil system and a reduced power loss. Any additional thrust components from a prestressed flexible-disc coupling or a gear-type coupling (gear lock) are completely avoided. The use of a flexible intermediate shaft (quill shaft) gives the solid coupling the same lateral flexibility as for a geartype or flexible-disc coupling. Criteria for allowable misalignment are given in this paper. A solid coupling is neither exposed {{to any kind of}} wear nor endangered by corrosion or stress corrosion so that no maintenance is necessary. Couplings have a decisive influence on rotordynamics. The conventional arrangement of a multicasing train with gear-type or flexible-disc couplings incorporates individual thrust bearings located outboard of the journal bearings (long shaft over hangs). Introducing solid couplings leads to a stiffer rotor by eliminating individual thrust bearings. A comparison of critical speeds of a high-speed/high-power compressor train is made alternatively equipped with solid couplings, flexible-disc or gear-type couplings. The response of the different rotors and couplings to specified unbalance weights is calculated and compared throughout the complete speed range. Torsional and lateral critical frequencies can easily be influenced by modification of <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts,</b> even after installation of a compressor train. Operating experience on nearly 1500 compressors equipped with solid couplings have proven their excellent reliability especially on high speed, high power turbocompressor applications...|$|E
50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> with the second U-joint phased {{in relation to the}} first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is {{known as a}} drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.|$|R
50|$|Also notable is {{that the}} {{original}} camshaft was retained as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> driving the DOHC cam sprockets via a front-mounted, single - long - timing chain, having the side-mounted distributor and nearby external oil pump/filter assembly in original locations, requiring few modifications to the mass-produced iron block.|$|R

50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{shortened}} leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output <b>shaft,</b> and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R

The vehicle comprises an elongated skin or body having a front end and a rear end, with a nose piece at the front end for imparting force to composition material of the planetary body.
