50|$|The crane {{business}} grew steadily {{through the}} 80’s; eventually developing into jib cranes, monorails and wide spans <b>double</b> <b>girder</b> cranes. Carl Young purchased {{the company in}} April 1989. He incorporated it as Mentor Dynequip Inc. but kept Mentor Dynamics as the operating name. The focus was on designing and making small to mid-sized overhead cranes and gantry cranes. Mentor was also a distributor for hoist and specialty crane manufactures. In early 1992 the business was restructured, this time without the ship liner business or the 36000 sq ft company owned factory.|$|E
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} crankshaft drove {{both the}} eccentric rods {{and the combination}} levers of the valve gear. The piston valves were of the outside admission type. The valve heads were connected by a <b>double</b> <b>girder</b> arrangement, each actuated by a vertical rocking shaft located between the two girders and midway between the two heads, with a further connecting link pivoted just behind the valve head nearest the front. A sealed oscillating shaft drove the offset upper rocker arm and link, and the whole assembly worked inside the exhaust space of the steam chest. The advantage of having admission steam working on the outside faces of the valves meant that the volume under maximum pressure was completely sealed at the ends with no glands susceptible to leakage.|$|E

40|$|Recently in Japan, {{long span}} steel bridge systems with <b>double</b> I-type <b>girders</b> have been {{constructed}} for the reasons of reductions of construction cost and time of construction work, and simplicity of maintenance. This types of bridges have small numbers of girders, therefore, it is inherently difficult to determine the sizes of member elements, such as rubber bearing, RC pier and concrete pile foundation, so as to satisfy the ultimate performance constraints due to devastating earthquakes. In this study, the optimum design method is developed for the seismic design of steel bridge system with <b>double</b> I-type <b>girders</b> in which the design of experiments is successfully utilized in order to estimate the dynamic behaviours and sensitivities of the ultimate performance constraints {{with respect to the}} design variables. The optimum solutions of the heights of rubber bearings, cross-sectional dimensions and amount of steel reinforcements for RC piers and the detail of concrete pile foundation are determined by a classical branch and bound method.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} also unusual. Birch veneer strips {{about one third}} of the depth of the fuselage ran lengthwise, joining birch bulkheads into a girder which was then strengthened with four L-shaped spruce longerons. Stressed longitudinal spruce strips formed rounded upper and lower fuselage surfaces, so that the overall cross-section was roughly oval. A plywood <b>double</b> <b>girder</b> ran centrally along the bottom of the mid-fuselage to the engine bulkhead, forming a mounting for the lower wing pylon, the cockpit and controls and parts of the engine mounting and undercarriage. The fuselage and tail surfaces were fabric covered except for a veneered region around the open cockpit, set under the wing trailing edge. The wide chord fin had a curved leading edge; the two-piece tailplane was fixed to the upper longerons. The control surfaces were unbalanced and had non-rigid trailing edges, the fabric taking up a scalloped shape.|$|E
50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{also known}} as a bridge crane, is a type of crane where the hook-and-line mechanism runs along a horizontal beam that itself runs along two widely separated rails. Often it is in a long factory building and runs along rails along the building's two long walls. It is similar to a gantry crane. Overhead cranes typically consist of either a single beam or a double beam construction. These can be built using typical steel beams or a more complex box girder type. Pictured on the right is a single bridge box girder crane with the hoist and system operated with a control pendant. <b>Double</b> <b>girder</b> bridge are more typical when needing heavier capacity systems from 10 tons and above. The advantage of the box girder type configuration results in a system that has a lower deadweight yet a stronger overall system integrity. Also included would be a hoist to lift the items, the bridge, which spans the area covered by the crane, and a trolley to move along the bridge.|$|E

40|$|Welding {{process has}} been leading {{technological}} process {{in the production of}} modern metal products and structures for a long time. Among others, a very important characteristic of welding technology is that in the appropriate zone of construction it creates large temperature differences during cooling of pieces, because of disturbed expansion and contraction, creating internal stresses, which in practical applications of welded structures represent a serious problem. Internal stresses incurred as a result of welding can have very high values, even to the value of yield stress, so that a regular occurrence that is still {{in the course of the}} welding parts deform. Consideration of stress kinetic shows that at elevated temperatures, in certain conditions, the intensity of residual stress may cross the border and cause breakdown of materials and fracture. Residual stresses are multidirectional, and in combination with other stresses (stresses from external forces or its own weight) or at low temperatures could create conditions for the development of brittle fracture. This danger is greater as the parts that connect are with larger thickness and of higher strength materials, as well as misdialled technology of welding. Residual stresses in welded construction are undesirable, and it is necessary to eliminate or at least reduce their negative impact on structural safety.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel quay crane design, <b>double</b> <b>girder</b> bridge crane (DGBC). DGBC {{is capable of}} handling containers of two adjacent bays simultaneously, avoiding crane collisions, saving travelling and reposition cost, and eventually improving terminal efficiency. This problem is formulated as a resource-constrained project scheduling with objective to minimize the maximum completion time. A two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed in which an operating sequences on each bay is obtained by double cycling, and the integrated timetable for both bays is constructed by solving resource conflicts using the proposed minimum cost strategy. We examine effectiveness and performance of applying DGBC with double cycling. A case study is presented to illustrate how DGBC works with the two-stage method. Three extreme cases with respective conflict types are investigated to develop the performance bounds of DGBC with double cycling. The results show that DGBC can significantly improve terminal productivity, and outperforms single girder crane in both makespan and the lift operation percentage. The highest DGBC efficiency does not require maximum double cycles in two bay schedules; rather the integrated timetable for two bays is the main contribution to the DGBC performance as it yields better cooperation between two spreaders and the driver...|$|E

The abutment restraints were modeled by one joint link elements. The deck and the stems were modeled using shell element. After validating the modeling techniques, a parametric study was developed to study the prediction of FEM girder distribution factors (GDF). The FEM GDF predictions were compared to the prediction proposed by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in the provision AASHTO LRFD 2010. The parametric study considered the variable parameters of span length, slab thickness, number of double tees, angle of skew, and stem spacing.

40|$|A metro {{system is}} a railway {{transport}} system in an urban area with a high capacity, frequency and the grade separation from other traffic. An elevated metro system is more preferred type of metro system due to ease of construction and also it makes urban areas more accessible without any construction difficulty. An elevated metro system has two major elements pier and box girder. The present study focuses on two major elements, pier and box girder, of an elevated metro structural system. Conventionally the pier of a metro bridge is designed using a force based approach. During a seismic loading, the behaviour of a single pier elevated bridge relies mostly on the ductility and the displacement capacity. It is important to check the ductility of such single piers. Force based methods do not explicitly check the displacement capacity during the design. The codes are now moving towards a performance-based (displacement-based) design approach, which consider the design as per the target performances at the design stage. Performance of a pier designed by a Direct Displacement Based Design is {{compared with that of}} a force-based designed one. The design of the pier is done by both force based seismic design method and direct displacement based seismic design method {{in the first part of}} the study.

40|$|Many bridges on {{the local}} highway system need replacement. Local governments rely on the South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) to help replace the {{deficient}} bridges. With limited resources, SDDOT can only help replace about 30 bridges statewide each year, causing a backlog of local bridges in need of replacement. The current standard bridge used in these replacements is the <b>double</b> tee precast <b>girder</b> bridge for its relatively low construction cost, outsourced design, and short construction duration. The expected design life of these bridges was 50 to 70 years, but some built less than 40 years ago already need replacement.

It {{is only a matter}} of time before the joint begins to spall, creating a path for moisture to reach the prestressing steel, initiate corrosion, and degrade the structural capacity of the bridge. It should also be noted that the double tee should be designed for girder continuity, often achieved by a reinforced concrete overlay or transverse post tensioning.

5000|$|From The Cornwall Chronicle, April 23, 1870: [...] "The Longford iron bridge {{has been}} {{constructed}} and erected under contract by Mr. C. de Borgue from designs {{prepared by the}} company's engineers, Messrs. Doyne, Major, and Willett. It is on the principle known as the <b>double</b> Warren <b>girder,</b> and consists of two spans, each of 200 ft. The girder is continuous, fixed in the centre but expanding and contracting at both ends, upon an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne. The girders are of lattice work, formed by building at top and bottom, strings of plate iron 2 ft wide on the bottom, and 2 ft deep. These are connected together by vertical and diagonal bars, the vertical bars being placed 14 ft apart, and the diagonals crossed between these. The size {{of each of these}} bars is arranged according to its position in the bridge, and in exact proportion to the amount of work it is to perform, a much smaller bar being used in tho centre than at the ends of each span. The top and bottom strings, on the contrary are much stronger in the centre than at the ends. The space between the upper and lower strings is 19 ft. The two main girders are connected together by cross girders at every 14 ft, and upon these are rivetted the beams which carry the permanent rails. The cross girders are rivetted to the sides of the lower strings, and the top strings arc connected by strong angle irons, thus giving great stability to the whole structure, which represents, in section, a square of 20 ft. A feature in this Bridge {{is the fact that the}} rivet holes instead of being punched as is the ordinary process, have all been drilled as true as a gun barrel; the consequence being that not a single hole required alteration, even where two or three plates had to be bolted together. The rivets were all made to fit the holes cold, and as they were put in at a red heat, and driven up by means of a circular steel cap, they all fit- as tight as though the holes had been rammed with some soft substance. Hence the extreme rigidity and elasticity of the structure. The ends of the bridge are to be set off by four massive fluted columns of cast iron, having handsome basements, and relieved by ornamental capitals, and over the centre also is a massive ornamental casting, which will agreeably break the line and relieve the appearance of the structure. These are the only pieces of ornamentation in which tho engineers have indulged. The height of the bridge and of the viaduct immediately beyond were both deter mined after a careful survey of the country and the most minute enquiries respecting the various flood levels. The bridge is now 2 feet 6 inch cm clear above the level of the highest recorded flood, and as it offers no impediment whatever to the passage of the waters, it is regarded almost as an everlasting structure. The abutments and centre pier are not yet quite complete, inasmuch as they have to be built up to the sides of the bridge, but the brick work and masonry of which they are composed, is very massive. They are sixteen feet thick, and stand upon a foundation of stiff clay. We are informed that a bed of cement concrete was laid 1 ft thick, upon which the brickwork was commenced. The average depth of the concrete bed from the surface of the ground is 26 feet m, so that the foundations are imbedded 27 ft or more below the river level. The abutments and piers are composed of brick, with ponderous blocks of hard blue stone, dove-tailed together under the girders, with quoins, caps, and copings of freestone quarried in the immediate neighbourhood, of the quality of which the engineers speak very highly. We have referred above to an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne, the object of which is to supply a means of compensation for the expansion or contraction in tho length of long iron girders, produced by variations of temperature and also to remove the pounding of the girder upon its support, caused by tho uudulatory motion produced in the girder by the passage of a heavy load. This has hitherto been effected by means more or less imperfect, and it is believed that this invention will prove a great improvement upon those which have hitherto been in use. The apparatus consists of a cast-iron circular plate seven feet in diameter and four inches in thickness, which rests on the top of the abutment. From the upper surface of this plate, five vertical ribs or jaws project upwards to the height of one foot nine inches. They are three inches in thickness and ten inches apart, running along the plate, in the direction of the girder, for its whole diameter. The upper edges of these ribs are grooved across the line of the girder, and in these grooves there rests a cast-steel turned pin 5 ftlong, and three inches in diameter. From this pin two steel links depend between each pair of ribs, making eight in number : they are three inches square, and are furnished with eyes at each end three inches in diameter, and bushed with brass. They are 16 inch cm long from centre to centre of the eyes, and hang nearly touching the ribs on one side, and leaving a space of nearly three inches between them on the other. This completes the description of the lower or abutment member of the apparatus. The upper girder member is nearly similar, but inverted; its plate, instead of being circular, is oblong. The ribs are four in number, and project downwards. They are placed between the links with the grooves opposite to the eyes. Through these, and through the eyes, a steel pin similar to the one described passes. Thus, the lower portion of the upper member is suspended from the upper portion of the lower member. The girder rests upon the iron plate, and as it increases or diminishes in length, through changes of temperature, it pushes forward or draws backward the whole upper member, causing it to swing freely on the suspending links, as if it rested on the tray of an ordinary swing. There is also a third motion, which takes place in the girders, which must be provided for in the bearings on the abutments, or serious vibration is produced. It is the undulatory or wave motion, produced by the changing deflections of the girders under the action of a moving load, which causes the ends of the girders to rock on their bearings. This motion is also perfectly provided for by Mr Doyne's apparatus, as the plate, on which the girder rests rolls freely on the lower pin, and thus destroys all pounding action on the abutment plate. It will be seen that when longitudinal expansion or contraction takes place in the girder, the lower pin moves forwards and backwards through the ribs of the lower member, and consequently the holes in these arc so formed as to give free play to this motion; they are of a radial oblong form, which has been termed [...] "balanoidal," [...] or bean-shaped." ...|$|R
