5|$|Among primary headaches, the International Classification of <b>Headache</b> Disorders {{distinguishes between}} tension <b>headache</b> (the most common), migraine, and cluster <b>headache.</b> Aspirin or other {{over-the-counter}} analgesics are {{widely recognized as}} effective {{for the treatment of}} tension <b>headache.</b>|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the <b>headache</b> distinct, while the remainder have had a similar <b>headache</b> before. It is suspected that VAD with <b>headache</b> as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute <b>headache.</b> It is a <b>headache</b> usually {{made worse by}} standing, {{typically}} becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day <b>headache.</b> This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E
2500|$|More than 90% of <b>headaches</b> are primary <b>headaches.</b> Most {{of these}} primary <b>headaches</b> are tension <b>headaches.</b> Most people with tension <b>headaches</b> have [...] "episodic" [...] tension <b>headaches</b> that come and go. Only 3.3% of adults have chronic tension <b>headaches,</b> with <b>headaches</b> {{for more than}} 15 days in a month.|$|R
25|$|Primary <b>headaches</b> {{are more}} {{difficult}} to understand than secondary <b>headaches.</b> The exact mechanisms which cause migraines, tension <b>headaches</b> and cluster <b>headaches</b> are not known. There have been different theories over time which attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these <b>headaches.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Headaches</b> can be {{attributed}} to many different substances. Some of these include alcohol, NO, carbon monoxide poisoning, cocaine, caffeine and monosodium glutamate. Chronic use of certain medications used to treat <b>headaches</b> can also start causing <b>headaches,</b> known as medication overuse <b>headaches.</b> <b>Headaches</b> may also be a symptoms of medication withdrawal.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the symptoms, for example the combination of <b>headache,</b> signs of raised intracranial pressure and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of <b>headache</b> and neurological abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.|$|E

5|$|On June 5, 1986, {{the couple}} was living in Auburn, Washington when Bruce Nickell, 52, {{came home from work}} with a <b>headache.</b> According to Stella, Nickell took four Extra-Strength Excedrin {{capsules}} from a bottle in their home for his <b>headache</b> and collapsed minutes later. Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing emphysema.|$|E

40|$|<b>Headaches</b> {{are common}} in {{children}} and teenagers. By 7 years of age, 40 % of children have had <b>headaches,</b> with 2. 5 % having frequent nonmigraine types and 1. 4 % having migraine (1). By 15 years of age, 75 % have had headaches: 15. 7 % with frequent tension type, 5. 3 % with migraines, and 54 % with infrequent nonmigraine <b>headaches.</b> The evaluation of the child with <b>headaches</b> {{is similar to the}} basic approach in adults, described in Chapter 1. A complete his-tory is essential. Information from parents and other family mem-bers or caregivers, especially for younger children, is vital. In some adolescents, it is helpful to obtain the history from the child without family members present and then from family members. A psychosocial history is also important. For recurring or chronic <b>headaches,</b> what is the impact of the <b>headaches</b> on the child’s life? Has school been missed, has homework gone undone, or have other activities been curtailed? Because of the frequent familial nature of migraine, family history is also important. When you ask the parents about their own <b>headaches,</b> often you will diag-nose their migraines for the first time. A general physical and neurological examination is also necessary. General indications for diagnostic testing are discussed in Chapter 1 : Table 1 - 8 focus-es on indications in children and Table 1 - 9 gives general indica-tions for neuroimaging. This chapter covers the following topics: migraine, episodic tension-type <b>headaches,</b> chronic nonprogressive <b>headaches,</b> acute <b>headaches,</b> and chronic progressive <b>headaches.</b> Cluster <b>headaches,</b> the subject of Chapter 7, are not separately dis-cussed because the onset usually occurs after 20 years of age and these <b>headaches</b> are rare in children. Some other causes of secondary <b>headaches</b> in children and adolescents, such as post-traumatic, ophthalmological causes, and pseudotumor cerebri, are also reviewed in other chapters.

5|$|The CSF {{sample is}} also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid.

40|$|Tension-type <b>headaches</b> are {{extremely}} common {{and are in}} some cases characterized by severe socio-economic burden and reduced quality of life. Currently {{there is a great}} room for improving research in regarding most aspects of tension-type <b>headaches.</b> The connection of physical and psychological factors has been identified but the magnitude of each factor in the pathogenesis of tension-type <b>headaches</b> still remains unclear. Despite the establishment of multi-factorial relationship in the pathogenesis of tension-type <b>headaches</b> and many theories applied, no clear etiology has been found. Current theories suggest that peripheral pathomechanisms associated with myofasciae is the most important factor for infrequent tension-type <b>headaches</b> and central processes such as spinal and supra-spinal sensitization are more involved in chronic cases of tension-type <b>headaches.</b> There are several treatment modalities that are available for patients with tension-type <b>headaches.</b> The recommended drug therapies in the case of acute tension <b>headaches</b> include simple analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In chronic cases, pain killers should be avoided and replaced with prophylactic therapy. MSc/MAáltalános orvosango...|$|R

5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} <b>headache</b> disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>headache,</b> about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth.

25|$|Tension-type <b>headaches</b> {{can usually}} be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), {{acetaminophen}} or aspirin. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type <b>headaches</b> unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type <b>headaches,</b> amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type <b>headaches</b> have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type <b>headaches.</b>|$|R

The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in <b>headache</b> following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of <b>headache</b> when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
