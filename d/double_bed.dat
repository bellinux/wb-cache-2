25|$|Lincoln met Joshua Fry Speed in Springfield, Illinois, in 1837, when Lincoln was a {{successful}} attorney and member of Illinois' House of Representatives. They lived together for four years, during which time they occupied the same bed during the night (some sources specify a large <b>double</b> <b>bed)</b> and developed a friendship that would last until their deaths. According to some sources, William Herndon and a fourth man also slept in the same room.|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one <b>double</b> <b>bed,</b> meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Puyi {{married his}} fourth wife, a 15-year-old student named Li Yuqin, {{who was a}} Han Chinese from Changchun, Jilin. She was {{designated}} as Puyi's Concubine Fu (福貴人). In February 1943, school principal Kobayashi and teacher Fujii of the Nan-Ling Girls Academy took ten girl students to a photography studio for portraits. Three weeks later, the school teacher and the principal visited Li Yuqin's home and told her Puyi ordered {{her to go to}} the Manchukuo palace to study. She was first taken directly to Yasunori Yoshioka who thoroughly questioned her. Yoshioka then drove her back to her parents and told them Puyi ordered her to study at the palace. Money was promised to the parents. She was subjected to a medical examination and then taken to Puyi's sister Yunhe and instructed in palace protocol. Two years later when Manchukuo collapsed, Li Yuqin shared a train with Empress Wanrong, who was experiencing opium withdrawal symptoms at the time. They were both arrested by the Soviets and sent to a prison in Changchun. Li Yuqin was released in 1946 and sent back home. She worked in a textile factory while she studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 1955 she began visiting Puyi in prison. After applying to the Chinese authorities for a divorce, the government responded on her next prison visit by showing her to a room with a <b>double</b> <b>bed</b> and ordered her to reconcile with Puyi, and she said the couple obeyed the order. She divorced Puyi in May 1957. She later married a technician, and had two sons. During the Cultural Revolution she became a target for attack by the Red Guards because she used to be Puyi's concubine. She died of liver problems in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Butlin's {{retirement}} {{was forced}} by circumstance. His accountant informed Butlin {{that the total}} rate of income tax and surtax that Butlin was due {{to pay for the}} coming year was 115% of his income. Butlin took the decision to move from his London home to become a permanent resident in Blair Adam House, St. John, on the island of Jersey, in the Channel Islands. This move was financially beneficial since Jersey had a fixed 20% rate of income tax. He remained a resident of Jersey until his death on 12 June 1980, aged 80. [...] He is buried in the parish of St John and his grave is shaped to represent a <b>double</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} contributed {{to a sense of}} normality as their presence provided conventional social, family, and gender relations. [...] The internees believed the children's presence made them less selfish, as it forced them to think of the latter's welfare. The women organised Christmas and birthday celebrations. Other diversions such as musicals, plays, recitals, and variety shows were also staged. Although the camp lacked books and educational supplies, the teachers and educational administrators amongst the internees were able to provide lessons for the children at the primary and secondary levels. Additionally, extensive educational opportunities were available for the adults: language courses for Chinese, Malay, and French, and also lectures on photography, yachting, journalism, and poultry-keeping. In addition to the personal diaries kept by internees, many of them now held by the Imperial War Museum, a record of life in the camp was created using a <b>double</b> <b>bed</b> sheet. The Day Joyce Sheet was embroidered and appliquéd with 1100 names, signs and figures including a diary in code.|$|E
500|$|Completing {{the ground}} floor was a smaller lounge, and a large garage. The main {{staircase}} to the upper floors was situated in the entrance hall. The house had six bedrooms, with five on the first floor. The giant master bedroom featured a huge <b>double</b> <b>bed,</b> white carpets and an en-suite bathroom complete with sunken bathtub, shower, Jacuzzi and 'his and hers' wash basins. Lennon wanted the guest bedrooms to contain works of art by students of the Liverpool Art College. In particular, two drawings by former Beatles' bassist Stuart Sutcliffe were hung, for what Lennon described as [...] "sentimental reasons". The first floor also had a study. On the top floor was the attic, which Lennon claimed as his own, painting the ceiling one bright colour, then changing to another when the paint ran out, and installing most of his musical equipment there. Outside the house, to the right as you looked down from the sunroom, lay the swimming pool. In 1967, Lennon suggested a mirrored bottom for the pool; being advised {{that this would be}} not only impractical and expensive, but potentially dangerous to swimmers, he settled for a large eye mosaic set in the side. The mosaic was based on the Eye of Knowledge, which was part of the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.|$|E

500|$|Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool, {{which allowed}} Julia {{to stay at}} home at Blomfield Road, to look after Baird, Jackie, a cat named [...] "Elvis", and the 11-year-old Lennon, who had started to visit and {{occasionally}} stayed overnight. Baird would give up her bed to Lennon, and share Jackie's <b>double</b> <b>bed.</b> Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, such as collecting golf balls on the local course, on top of the five shillings that Lennon's Aunt Mimi gave him. During Lennon's visits, he would climb trees with Baird and Jackie, test Baird's spelling, and once gave Baird half-a-crown to leave him alone when he wanted to kiss his first girlfriend. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, To Me You Are So Wonderful, [...] "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". [...] "My Son John"—sung by David Whitfield—was released in 1956. Although Mimi sent Lennon to his Aunt's croft in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, for his holidays, he later persuaded Mimi to let him take short holidays in North Wales with the Dykins family. Julia took Baird and Jackie to Rosebury Street, Liverpool, to watch Lennon play with The Quarrymen {{on the back of a}} flatbed coal truck on 22 June 1957. Baird was allowed to sit on the back, but as the music was too loud she asked to be taken off. The Quarrymen played twice that day as part of a celebration to mark the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool's charter by King John. Lennon and McCartney would later rehearse in the bathroom of Blomfield Road because they said the acoustics [...] "sounded like a recording studio".|$|E
