5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and <b>how</b> <b>there</b> is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E
25|$|In ontological hermeneutics, {{a horizon}} {{is used to}} {{identify}} an individual's past experiences, personal beliefs and opinions, cultural background, intentionality, and overall life direction. In simpler terms, to refer to an individual's horizon is to refer to an individual's future goals, as informed by their past experiences and personal belief system. Since goals, beliefs, and experiences are plural, there can be horizons within a larger horizon, similar to <b>how</b> <b>there</b> can be multiple thoughts within a core belief in CBT, or <b>how</b> <b>there</b> can be multiple experiences of high school within the overall experience of high school. However, there is never one masterful, overarching horizon that governs all the others.|$|E

500|$|Another theme found {{throughout}} {{the book is the}} hardship of life in the wild. Reviews have note how the story does not cover up the hardships of Clan life. School Library Journal commented on how the story describes the hardships and difficulties of a feral cat's life in detail and <b>how</b> <b>there</b> is no sugarcoating of the violence. Fantasy Book Review also wrote [...] "Erin Hunter does not spare the reader from the grim realities of living in the wild". Kirkus Reviews noted that doing so shows how the Clans are on the brink of survival.|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} enthusiastic {{approval from}} the Dahl Estate, Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct in May 2003. Burton compared the project's languishing development to Batman (1989), which he directed, in <b>how</b> <b>there</b> had been varied creative efforts with both films. He said, [...] "Scott Frank's version was the best, probably the clearest, and the most interesting, but they had abandoned that." [...] Liccy Dahl commented that Burton {{was the first and}} only director the estate was happy with. He had previously produced another of the author's adaptations with James and the Giant Peach (1996), and, like Roald and Liccy, disliked the 1971 film because it strayed from the book's storyline.|$|E

But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Men" [...] {{is a song}} by Barbadian {{recording}} artist Rihanna from her fifth studio album, Loud (2010). Written by Melvin Hough II, Rivelino Wouter, Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas and Onika Maraj, and produced by Mel & Mus, the song was sent to urban radio on December 7, 2010, as the album's third single in the United States, and was re-sent to urban radio on January 25, 2011. A hip hop song, it features rap vocals by Nicki Minaj and instrumentation consisting of sirens and bass. The song's lyrics revolve around <b>how</b> <b>there</b> is an endless supply of men available in the world. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics; some praised the chemistry between Rihanna and Minaj, while others commented that it bore strong resemblances to Beyoncé's song [...] "Diva" [...] with regard to its composition, and were critical of the notion.|$|E

500|$|For the cutscenes, the {{localization}} team {{took into}} account that the animation {{had been done to}} the Japanese lines, so they made sure that the English script matched the already set lip flaps and timing. Because the Japanese voice acting was not yet recorded when Hsu worked on the English dub script, she used her imagination to guess what the Japanese voice acting would be like based on the script; this was made easier due to her familiarity with [...] "standard anime conventions" [...] from frequently watching anime. For some dialogue, she wrote alternative lines, as the footage had not yet been finished, and the script could be interpreted in different ways: in one scene, where Phoenix speaks on the phone, Hsu had him follow the line [...] "It's for this very reason I returned" [...] with either [...] "Time to bring it to an end" [...] or [...] "To put an end to it all"; she used the former because of <b>how</b> <b>there</b> was a dramatic pause between the two lines.|$|E
500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and <b>how</b> <b>there</b> were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the Gin Tama manga has generally been positive. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network found the manga to be a [...] "one-of-a-kind comedy" [...] praising the characters' personalities and gags. On the other hand, the artwork was criticized for being [...] "hard to follow" [...] when there are fast scenes. Jokes regarding clichés from other shōnen series were also positively received by About.com writer Deb Aoki, who, like Santos, found the artwork to be [...] "the only thing that distracts from the otherwise considerable pleasures of this loveable, goofy manga". However, characters' designs were praised for its variations including the ones from the aliens appearing in the series by Katherine Dacey from Pop Culture Shock who remarked that [...] "These characters add visual interest and life to every panel, keeping the reader invested when the stories stall." [...] Other negative comments regarding the manga have the few number of aliens appearing in the series {{as well as how}} some chapters are focused in fights such as Hijikata's fight against Gintoki. Michael Aronson from Manga Life concluded his review of the manga by saying that [...] "The potential is there, but the execution is struggling" [...] as still he liked the comedy from the story. Comics Village's Alex Hoffman mentioned that Gin Tama [...] "can't truly be compared to those comics because of one thing: the jokes." [...] He found the context from the series hilarious and like <b>how</b> <b>there</b> are new jokes in every chapter. Like other reviewers, Hoffman also disliked Sorachi's artwork, but still found the manga to be [...] "a great comedy, or a great read." [...] Comic Book Bin writer Leroy Douresseaux found that the large number of characters with different appearances in the series allow the reader to remain entertained with the series as [...] "at least every few pages or so present some unusual and interesting visual." ...|$|E
