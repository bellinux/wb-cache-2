5|$|Shatner had {{presented}} his idea to studio head Frank Mancuso while filming The Voyage Home. Mancuso liked Shatner's idea {{and agreed to}} hire a writer to draft a film treatment. Shatner wanted novelist Eric Van Lustbader, but negotiations between Lustbader and Paramount failed over the author's requested $1million salary. Shatner <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> story himself {{and gave it to}} Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} capture of Jerusalem, the British War Office had been very worried about Allenby's {{extended}} advance and warned of a possible retirement back to Gaza and Beersheba if the war on the Western Front <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> transfer {{of large numbers of}} troops from the Levant. This attitude changed immediately after Jerusalem was captured. The War Office then wanted to know how Allenby might exploit his success {{with the addition of a}} division from Mesopotamia.|$|E

Medler grew up near Saginaw, Michigan but {{spent most of his}} life at Walpole Island.

5|$|Ray's regular {{film editor}} was Dulal Datta, but the {{director}} usually <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from Pather Panchali). At {{the beginning of}} his career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.|$|E
5000|$|The theory propounded was {{summarized}} by Stephen Berry, a chemist; [...] "describing the following causal chain: {{the properties of}} <b>the</b> chemical elements <b>dictate</b> <b>the</b> types of monomers that can be formed in prebiotic syntheses, which then <b>dictate</b> <b>the</b> properties of the occurring polymers, which finally <b>dictate</b> <b>the</b> properties of the first eobionts and all succeeding cells."

5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E
5|$|Although Michigan {{was able}} to score first, it was Michigan State that <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> pace of the game. After Michigan's 34-yard field goal, the only scoring in the first quarter, Michigan State responded with a 61-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Edwin Baker, which were the first points of the second quarter. Michigan took the lead {{a few minutes later}} with a 12-yard touchdown reception by Martell Webb, but the Spartans responded with a 41-yard rushing touchdown by Le'Veon Bell, and later added to their lead with a 38-yard field goal by Dan Conroy just before halftime. State built on their lead in the third quarter with 2 touchdowns: first a 41-yard reception by Mark Dell, then an 8-yard run by Larry Caper. Michigan's only points of the second half came on a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Denard Robinson. Michigan State sealed their win with a 28-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air Cadet League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area Cadet Instructor Cadre officer, regional cadet advisor, area cadet officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) of the community (to include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|Bullet for My Valentine, often {{abbreviated}} as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh {{heavy metal}} band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band {{is composed of}} Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> name change, which {{was followed by a}} change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the Red Army had {{advanced}} to the Potsdamerplatz, and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. Afterwards Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his {{last will and testament}}. He signed these documents at 04:00 and then retired to bed (some sources say Hitler <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all sources agree on the timing of the signing).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was born}} in Austria—then part of Austria-Hungary—and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was {{decorated}} during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. While in jail he <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"). Released in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as {{being part of a}} Jewish conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham speaks of the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined {{to be part of the}} Book of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day Mack Brown {{announced}} his acceptance of the Texas head coaching position, seven North Carolina football players allegedly assaulted a North Carolina student, severely injuring him. All seven were charged with offenses ranging from misdemeanor assault to simple assault. Among the players charged were defensive leader and All-American linebacker Kivuusama Mays and two other starters on North Carolina's defense. At the time, UNC policy <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> immediate suspension of any player charged with a felony, and punishment for lesser charges to be decided on a case-by-case basis. After investigating the incident, North Carolina school officials cleared six of the seven accused players {{to participate in the}} Gator Bowl with judicial charges still pending. The seventh accused player, backup defensive tackle Ricco McCain, was suspended indefinitely from the team while legal action proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Raspe, {{probably}} {{for fear of}} a libel suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and <b>dictated</b> <b>the</b> entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed {{that it was a}} competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, Karl Reinhard.|$|E
