5|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation funded a <b>hookworm</b> {{eradication}} campaign through the International Health Division. This campaign used {{a combination of}} politics and science, along with collaboration between healthcare workers and government officials to accomplish its goals.|$|E
5|$|On Gates' advice, Rockefeller {{became one}} of the first great benefactors of medical science. In 1901, he founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. It changed its name to Rockefeller University in 1965, after {{expanding}} its mission to include graduate education. It claims a connection to 23 Nobel laureates. He founded the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1909, an organization that eventually eradicated the <b>hookworm</b> disease, which had long plagued rural areas of the American South. His General Education Board made a dramatic impact by funding the recommendations of the Flexner Report of 1910. The study had been undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} 1911 that Standard Oil must be {{dismantled}} for violation of federal anti-trust laws. It was broken up into 34 separate entities that included companies {{that would become}} ExxonMobil, Chevron and others. Some of them still have {{the highest level of}} revenue in the world. Individual pieces of the company were worth more than the whole and, as shares of these doubled and tripled in value in their early years, Rockefeller became the country's first billionaire with a fortune worth nearly 2% of the national economy. His peak net worth was estimated at $336 billion (in 2007 USD, inflation-adjusted) in 1913. Rockefeller spent the last 40 years of his life in retirement at his estate in Westchester County, New York. His fortune was mainly used to create the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy through the creation of foundations that had a major effect on medicine, education and scientific research. His foundations pioneered the development of medical research and were instrumental in the near-eradication of <b>hookworm</b> and yellow fever. in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} conducted has shown favourable results using <b>hookworms</b> to treat coeliac disease. Though research points to anti-allergenic properties associated with hook worm infections, the FDA does not currently recognize <b>hookworms</b> as a treatment.|$|R
40|$|Human <b>hookworms</b> are {{parasitic}} nematodes infecting about 700 million individuals, {{largely in}} tropical {{regions of the}} world [1]. In endemic areas, most infected people carry a mixed worm burden, including Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworms), Trichuris trichuria (whipworms), and Ancylostoma duodenale and/or Necator americanus (both <b>hookworms).</b> Of these soil-transmitted helminths, <b>hookworms</b> are the most pathogenic because of their propensity to feed on blood, resulting in anaemia, particularly in those with low iron reserves such as children and women of reproductive age...|$|R

5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic <b>hookworm,</b> which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a <b>hookworm</b> known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hookworm</b> {{infection}} {{is generally considered}} to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, <b>hookworm</b> {{infection is}} an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is “silent and insidious.” There are general symptoms that an individual may experience soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with N. americanus. Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the “silent and insidious” symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity <b>hookworm</b> infections. Major morbidity associated with <b>hookworm</b> infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of <b>hookworm</b> infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic <b>hookworm</b> infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with <b>hookworm</b> during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} public health {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} children who are infected with <b>hookworm.</b> This focus on children {{is largely due to}} the large body of evidence that has demonstrated strong associations between <b>hookworm</b> infection and impaired learning, increased absences from school, and decreased future economic productivity.|$|E

When considering disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), neglected tropical diseases, including <b>hookworm</b> infection, rank among diarrheal diseases, ischemic heart disease, malaria, and tuberculosis {{as one of the}} most important health problems of the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation {{started a}} program to {{eradicate}} <b>hookworm</b> in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated {{that there was a}} crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the <b>hookworm</b> program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The <b>Hookworm</b> Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the <b>hookworm</b> campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's <b>hookworm</b> campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.|$|E
