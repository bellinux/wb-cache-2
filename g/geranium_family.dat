40|$|Hardy geraniums {{are among}} the mostfashionable garden {{perennials}} today. Their popularity {{is due in part}} to the many new and improved cultivars that have been introduced in recent years. Garden writers time and again extol the merits of hardy gerani-ums—their versatility, landscape adaptability and superior ornamental traits. Hardy gerani-ums have come a long way from the days when they were consigned to the wildflower garden. Geranium is in the <b>geranium</b> <b>family</b> (Geraniaceae) with approximately 300 species widely distributed in temperate regions of the world. Hardy geranium is a general term that is used to distinguish Geranium from its tender cousin Pelargonium, the colorful floral or bedding geranium. Cranesbill, anothe...|$|E

The results proved that all tested extracts showed activity against large white butterfly. Geranium pratense L. and Geranium senquineum L. showed better activity than other Geranium plants. Water extracts from these species protected cabbage plants against laying eggs, while applied on eggs caused their mortality. Alcohol and water extracts from G. pratense L. and water extracts from G. senquineum L. increased an amount of food put on mass gain of caterpillars...|$|E

It is native to the Caucasus region of northern Europe. It has palmate leaves and pale pink flowers striped violet. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{and gene}} mapping studies reveal that {{chloroplast}} DNA from geranium (Pelargonium hortorum) has sustained {{a number of}} extensive duplications and inversions, resulting in a genome arrangement radically unlike that of other plants. At 217 kilobases in size, the circular chromosome is about 50 % larger than the typical land plant chloroplast genome and {{is by far the}} largest described to date, to our knowledge. Most of this extra size can be accounted for by a 76 -kilobase inverted duplication, three times larger than the normal chloroplast DNA inverted repeat. This tripling has occurred primarily by spreading of the inverted repeat into regions that are single copy in all other chloroplast genomes. Consequently, 10 protein genes that are present only once in all other land plants are duplicated in geranium. At least six inversions, occurring in both the inverted repeat and large single-copy region, must be postulated to account for all of the gene order differences that distinguish the geranium genome from other chloroplast genomes. We report the existence in <b>geranium</b> of two <b>families</b> of short dispersed repeats and hypothesize that recombination between repeats may be the major cause of inversions in geranium chloroplast DNA...|$|R
