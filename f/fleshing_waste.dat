The compounding of the HDPE with coconut <b>flesh</b> <b>waste</b> was performed via a twin screw extruder which blends the materials with dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and chemical blowing agent (ADC). Five formulations with varying amount of coconut <b>flesh</b> <b>waste</b> were extruded at setting temperatures of 170 °C at the melting zone whereas temperature of 190 °C {{was set at}} the end of the die zone. This research studies the effect of different filler loading, the incorporation of DCP as crosslinking agent and ADC as the blowing agent on morphology (cell structure) of the foam samples. From the optical micrographs of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), it was obvious that closed-cell foams were developed. Plus, from the SEM images obtained it can also be concluded that as the filler loading increased, distorted and irregular cell geometry was formed. Density determination by Mettler Toledo Density Meter revealed that density increment was achieved by all foam samples as the filler content increased. From the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) result, it was noticeable that the percent of crystallinity decreases with increased in filler loading and the melting temperature of the biocomposites were not much affected by the incorporation of coconut waste.

(2008) {{recorded}} SEM to {{know the}} changes in surface morphology (texture) in the control and final vermicomposted mixtures of a solid waste (animal fleshing) produced from leather industry. The study observed that the aggregates of biomass was firmly bounded in the control animal fleshing mixture, whereas the lignin and the protein matrix was broken down by worms in the final feed mixtures of animal <b>fleshing</b> <b>waste.</b> The numerous surface changes in the post-vermicomposted mixtures of animal fleshing confirmed the compost maturity and degradation of waste by earthworms. Zhao et al. (2010) recorded SEM during the vermicomposting of domestic wastewater sludge. The study reported that the initial sludge had a fluffy structure with maximum rod-shaped cells, whereas the fresh casts produced in the vermifilter exhibited a porous and fragmented appearance. Using SEM analysis of vermicomposted sewage sludge and cow dung, humic acid-like fraction has been observed by Li et al. (2011). In the initial raw samples, humic acid like-fraction was characterized by flakes and fragments. However, in the final vermiproducts, humic acid-like fraction were close-grained, lumpy and possesses water permeability and ventilation for soil application.|$|E

The results revealed that the weight loss at two different temperatures in feed mixtures of summer and spring season were 5 – 10 % higher than that of winter season. The authors confirmed that the spring and summer season composting gave higher decomposition and maturity of organic wastes than the winter season. Ravindran et al.

TG analysis of initial feed mixtures showed maximum mass loss where as lower loss of mass was observed in the final feed mixtures of vermicomposting as these mixtures attained stability. This minimum mass loss {{may be due to the}} decomposition of organic waste by worm E. eugeniae. The TG curves in the temperature range of 200 – 500  °C of all feed mixtures showed mineralization and thermal degradation of aromatic structures.|$|E

30|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{technique is}} widely used for determining the maturity in vermicompost material. Gieguzynska et al. (1998) and Sellami et al. (2008) suggested three important regions where exact absorbance could be measured in the UV-vis spectra: (1) the absorption at 280  nm indicates {{the beginning of the}} transformation of lignin and aliphatic compounds, (2) the absorption at 472  nm indicates the beginning of organic macromolecules depolymerisation and humification, and (3) the absorption at 664  nm is an indication of a highly humified material {{with a high degree of}} aromatic compounds and oxygen content in the stabilization phase. Ravindran et al. (2013) performed UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of humification during vermicomposting of fermented animal <b>fleshing</b> <b>waste.</b> The absorbance ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 4 / 6 and Q 2 / 4) in all treatments decreased and reached minimum at the end. The humification index decreased in treated mixtures with earthworms compared to that in the treated mixtures without earthworm. Low humification index in the final vermicompost indicates a high level of organic material humification. Lim and Wu (2015) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to determine the degree of humification during vermicomposting of palm oil industry effluent. The UV-vis spectra of the final vermicompost showed wider shoulder as compared to initial waste mixtures, reflecting the maturity of the final vermicompost. The results indicated that both the humification index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) were lower in the final vermicompost as compared to initial wastes. The decreases in humification index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) indicates decomposition and degradation of organic compounds by earthworms. Hussain et al. (2016 b) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of humification during vermicomposting of toxic parthenium weed. The results reveal that the humification index (Q 4 / 6) values of initial parthenium weed (7.29) were reduced (1.89) after vermicomposting. The reduction in the humification index of final vermicomposted parthenium weed indicates weed’s transformation into a strongly humified and matured material. Hussain et al. (2016 c) also confirmed the high level of humification during the vermicomposting of toxic and allelopathic ipomoea weed. The findings indicated that the humification index (Q 4 / 6) values of toxic weed reduced from 7.74 to 1.90 in the final vermicompost. The fall of humification index achieved after vermicomposting of ipomoea weed indicates high level of humification by earthworms. The earthworm along with microorganisms accelerates the decomposition and stabilization of organic material and turns it into stable humus.|$|E

These experiments include the following treatments (doses) : AVG and GA 3 0 mg L- 1 (water sprayed); 60 mg L- 1, 120 mg L- 1, 180 mg L- 1 of AVG and 60 mg L- 1, 120 mg. L- 1, 180 mg. L- 1 of GA 3. For both clones the characteristics evaluated was break between spray and harvest, fruit fall before harvest, peduncle size, peduncle basal diameter, peduncle top diameter, cashew total mass, peduncle mass, nut mass and peduncle flesh firmness. The fourth and fifth experiments had same treatments and experimental set of the second and third. However the evaluated variables, for both clones, was: SS, AT, SS/AT relation, AS and VC. In the first experiment it was observed that the GA 3 120 mg L- 1 dose could be a alternative for the early dwarf cashew clone CCP 76, because it improved the commercial quality attributes of the peduncles. In the experiments two and three GA 3 increased the break between the spraying and the harvest, the size and firmness of clones peduncles studied. In the two last experiments the GA 3 increased the SS/AT relation of the peduncles of CCP 76 and BRS 189 early dwarf cashew clones. Therefore, besides it detain the maturation time, the growth regulators also improved some quality attributes of the peduncles, what is well wished due to the fact that the improvement of such attributes is predominantly made by genetic improvement, and this process, in the current conditions, takes a lot of time to be concluded. Um dos vÃrios problemas que preocupam os cajucultores, especialmente os que pretendem atuar no comÃrcio de caju in natura, Ã a conservaÃÃo pÃs-colheita demasiadamente pequena dos pedÃnculos, atribuÃda Ã rÃpida perda de firmeza dos mesmos, afetando negativamente a venda desse pseudofruto. O uso de reguladores de crescimento pode ser uma alternativa para melhorar a qualidade do pedÃnculo (manter a firmeza da polpa), evitar o desperdÃcio (diminuir a queda prÃ-colheita), aumentar o tempo de colheita (abreviar a sazonalidade), desse modo, reduzindo custo de produÃÃo na cajucultura. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da aplicaÃÃo de AVG e GA 3 em prÃ-colheita, sobre a qualidade e produÃÃo dos pseudofrutos dos clones de cajueiro-anÃo-precoce CCP 76 e BRS 189, cultivados na regiÃo Nordeste do Brasil. Para tanto, foram realizados cinco experimentos, sendo as repetiÃÃes as datas de colheita, para cada tratamento. O primeiro foi realizado em blocos casualizados, com duas plantas por parcela e 10 frutos por planta, com os seguintes tratamentos (dosagens) para o clone CCP 76 : 0 mg L- 1 de AVG e GA 3 (pulverizaÃÃo com Ãgua); 40 mg L- 1 de AVG; 80 mg L- 1 de AVG; 120 mg L- 1 de AVG; 40 mg L- 1 de GA 3; 80 mg. L- 1 de GA 3; e 120 mg. L- 1 de GA 3. As caracterÃsticas analisadas foram: potencial hidrogeniÃnico (pH), sÃlidos solÃveis (SS), acidez titulÃvel (AT), relaÃÃo sÃlidos solÃveis/acidez titulÃvel (SS/AT), aÃÃcares solÃveis (AS), vitamina C (VC), carotenoides totais (CT), antocianinas totais (ANT) e polifenois extraÃveis (PE). O segundo e terceiro experimentos foram realizados em blocos casualizados, com duas plantas por parcela, 15 frutos por planta e dois clones de cajueiro (CCP 76 e BRS 189). Esses experimentos abrangeram os seguintes tratamentos (dosagens) : 0 mg L- 1 de AVG e GA 3 (pulverizaÃÃo com Ãgua); 60 mg L- 1 de AVG; 120 mg L- 1 de AVG; 180 mg L- 1 de AVG; 60 mg L- 1 de GA 3; 120 mg. L- 1 de GA 3; e 180 mg. L- 1 de GA 3. As caracterÃsticas analisadas, para ambos os clones, foram: intervalo entre a aplicaÃÃo e colheita, queda de frutos em prÃ-colheita, comprimento do pedÃnculo, diÃmetro basal do pedÃnculo, diÃmetro apical do pedÃnculo, massa total do caju, massa do pedÃnculo, massa da castanha e firmeza da polpa do pedÃnculo. O quarto e quinto experimentos tiveram os mesmos tratamentos e delineamento experimental do segundo e terceiro. Contudo as variÃveis analisadas, para ambos os clones, foram: SS, AT, relaÃÃo SS/AT, AS e VC. No primeiro experimento verifica-se que a dosagem de 120 mg L- 1 de GA 3 pode ser uma alternativa ao clone de cajueiro-anÃo-precoce CCP 76, pois melhora os atributos de qualidade comercial dos pedÃnculos. Nos experimentos dois e trÃs o GA 3 aumentou o intervalo entre a aplicaÃÃo e colheita, tamanho e a firmeza dos pedÃnculos dos clones estudados. Nos dois Ãltimos experimentos o GA 3 aumentou a relaÃÃo SS/AT dos pedÃnculos dos clones de cajueiro-anÃo-precoce CCP 76 e BRS 189. Portanto, alÃm de terem retardado o tempo de maturaÃÃo, os reguladores de crescimento tambÃm aprimoram alguns atributos de qualidade dos pedÃnculos, o que Ã bastante desejÃvel devido ao fato de que a melhoria de tais atributos Ã feita predominantemente via melhoramento genÃtico, e este processo, nas atuais condiÃÃes, leva muito tempo atÃ ser concluÃdo...|$|R
