500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E

'Mother,' he said, 'there are two new {{animals in}} the woods to-day, {{and the one that}} you said couldn't swim, swims, and the one that you said couldn't curl up, curls; and they've gone shares in their prickles, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> because <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are scaly all over, instead of one being smooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling round and round in circles, and I don't feel comfy.' ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The Climb" [...] was not {{intentionally}} {{written for}} the 2009 musical film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Co-writer Jessi Alexander conceived the song's melody while driving {{to the home of}} songwriting partner Jon Mabe. Once she arrived, she and Mabe developed a song about overcoming life's obstacles inspired by their personal struggles in the music industry. Alexander referred to the process as a form of [...] "therapy" [...] and recalled, [...] "I was just driving to work one day. It's just a typical day, nothing really special about that day. And I just had this melody in my head. And I couldn't get to my co-writer Jon Mabe or my guitar fast enough because I just wanted to play what I was hearing. And, you know, we just kinda put it down pretty fast and didn't really think anything about it. The lyrics kinda started to come, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, being kinda underdogs in the business. My co-writer was a songplugger, just turned songwriter, and I'd had record deals and ups and downs in the music business. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, we just came from a place of, you know, 'it's not a race'." [...] The song they created was titled [...] "It's the Climb" [...] and was written in third person. Alexander described the original song as [...] "more spiritual" [...] than the version that was released, and said it contained lines about prayer. However, she claimed she knew it was pop and suitable for The Walt Disney Company.|$|R

I did have a lot of fun with that. Being so cruel to people, it's {{similarly}} painful to Nora the first season where I was suffering from so much heartbreak and loss and pain. It's a different kind of pain where you are literally the Devil. You just sort of lose your soul and detach. But that's also really fun so there's no complaining about going through that kind of pain because it's what gets me out of the bed in the morning, to play parts like that. I even got to sing and dance! I couldn't believe my luck! I felt very very lucky and in love with the part and I got to do so many different things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Merkulova began rhythmic {{gymnastics}} {{because her}} mother {{wanted her to be}} a dancer, and her father wanted her to do sports—rhythmic gymnastics was the compromise. She is often compared to Alina Kabaeva in looks and in style. Merkulova said, [...] "Alina is my greatest idol since childhood. But I have never tried to imitate her. People say that my smile is similar to hers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that for <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, to smile during the performance is quite natural, because we have a great pleasure during the performance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other players, former players, officials, media {{commentators}} {{and fans}} also praised the behaviour of both players. Roger Federer {{said of the}} match, [...] "Its so impressive to see. I mean, I was watching this. I dont know if I was crying or laughing. It was too much". Federer also added, [...] "This is absolutely amazing. ... This is beyond anything". Novak Djokovic extolled both players, saying, [...] "You {{have to give them}} credit, both of them. Whoever wins today, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are winners".|$|E
5000|$|Responding to Tenet, Suskind {{challenged}} {{his credibility}} as a source on the issue, stating that [...] "George is the last man {{you want to call}} on something like this". Suskind stated, [...] "Tenet has talked often to reporters, even folks in Congress, that he doesnt remember anything, you know. Hes got a memory issue, obviously. And the people just shrug. Is it convenient? Is it something else? In any event, you know, I think Tenet is, you know, with the White House because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are a bit in the same leaky rowboat on this one."

5000|$|Buffy's second death did {{not result}} in another slayer being called because of Faith—a new slayer would not be called until her death; however, Buffy's second resurrection for some reason caused an {{imbalance}} in the Slayer line. Following her first death, Mayor Wilkins says that he does not want Buffy killed, because that will cause a new Slayer to be called, and, when she is discussing why she has been revived a second time with Giles, Buffy states, [...] "It was my time, Giles. Someone would've taken my place." [...] Following her second death, Buffy herself, addressing a group of Potential Slayers, says: [...] "My death could make you the next Slayer." [...] However, the shooting script for the final episode on the show originally included a much longer speech by Buffy to the potential Slayers, including the line [...] "It's true none of you has the power Faith and I have. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us would have to die for a new Slayer to be called, and we can't even be sure that girl is in this room.

40|$|After {{listing the}} five key {{elements}} of ecological restoration, ecology, economics, social values, cultural values, and politics, I celebrate {{the fact that in}} Brazil there is legislation on how to perform ecological restoration of degraded tropical forests, as well as an ongoing dialogue among legislators and scientists about this legislation, and also a lively debate among scientists as the best way forward, referring to articles by Brancalion et al. (2010) and Durigan et al. (2010) in this issue of Revista Árvore. Legislators elsewhere, especially megadiversity countries, should take note. I do not take sides in the debate; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> groups <b>of</b> authors make very good points. Instead I call on the scientists and legislators concerned with restoration to ponder five strategic tools: A. Start with clear concepts. B. Decide {{where you want to go}} and why. C. Negotiate who should benefit & how, and who should pay, how, & why. D. Work out how an honest cost-benefit analysis of restoration would look, regardless of the biome in which you are working. Finally, figure out how to make the restoration immediately attractive for private landowners. Otherwise, they will not cooperate as fully as they could or should, and restoration efforts will not achieve its full potential...|$|R

5000|$|Juror B37 told Cooper {{that she}} {{believed}} [...] "It pretty much happened the way George said it happened." [...] She believed the defense's argument that Martin had thrown the first punch in the confrontation {{and that it was}} Zimmerman's calls for help that were heard on the 911 call recordings, and she said that Zimmerman, fearing he was at risk of bodily harm or even loss of his life, had had a right to protect himself. In response to Cooper's questioning, she said that former lead police investigator Chris Serino's testimony that he had believed Zimmerman was telling the truth had made a strong impression on her (although Judge Nelson had instructed the jury that they should disregard Serino's comment and not consider it in rendering a verdict). Juror B37 also said that she did not believe Zimmerman had made any assumptions about Martin on the basis of Martin's skin color: [...] "I think all of us thought race did not play a role.... We never had that discussion." [...] The juror said she believed that ultimately both Martin and Zimmerman were partly to blame for the outcome. [...] "It's a tragedy this happened. But it happened.... And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them could have walked away.

5000|$|The {{history of}} The Effigies {{develops}} in three discernible periods, each {{marked by a}} different lead guitarist. The Effigies' original lineup consisted of John Kezdy (vocals), Earl [...] "Oil" [...] Letiecq (guitar), Paul Zamost (bass) and Steve Economou (drums). By 1984 Letiecq’s distractions had estranged him from the group, and {{in the words of}} Zamost, “we had problems with our guitar player. We had to switch guitar players....” Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar made inquiries about joining the band. Robert O’Connor replaced Letiecq as lead guitarist and this second lineup released two LPs, Fly on a Wire, and Ink. These albums were engineered and co-produced with the band by Iain Burgess, and were distinguished from the recordings of the first lineup by their sublimated aggression and comparatively muted rhythms. They also hinted at another growing division in the band. As Burgess put it, [...] "they got a lot of heat for the change in musical direction to some degree on the latter two albums that I worked on, Ink and Fly on a Wire. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> which have some really f*****g good songs on them, and some are, well, in my opinion, just not all that marvelous. I think John (Kezdy) would say the same thing. I’m sure he likes all the songs, but some of it we could have done better." [...] It was at this stage the band began getting tagged with the ill-fitting post-punk and post-hardcore labels.|$|E

I rather guess, the intellect of the Nineteenth Century, so full of miracle to Heavyside and others, is itself a mechanical or beaver intellect rather than a high or eminently human one. A dim and mean though authentic kind of intellect, this; venerable only in defect of better. This kind will avail but little in the higher enterprises of human intellect, especially in that highest enterprise of guiding men Heavenward, which, after all, is the one real [...] "governing" [...] of them on this God's-Earth:--an enterprise not to be achieved by beaver intellect, but by other higher and highest kinds. This is deficit first. And then secondly, Governments have, really to a fatal and extraordinary extent, neglected in late ages to supply themselves with what intellect was going; having, as was too natural in the dim time, taken up a notion that human intellect, or even beaver intellect, was not necessary to them at all, but that a little of the vulpine sort (if attainable), supported by routine, red-tape traditions, and tolerable parliamentary eloquence on occasion, would very well suffice. A most false and impious notion; leading to fatal lethargy on the part of Governments, while Nature and Fact were preparing strange phenomena in contradiction to it.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that it is a {{condition}} sine qua non of the success of Berkeley’s anisceptic project that the concept of certainty (i. e. of infallibility, required in philosophy of his time and, according to Berkeley, plainly gained only by his immaterialist solution) have to be fully analysable in terms of his own philosophy, otherwise the very concept should be dismissed by him owing to its meaninglessness. I maintain that his philosophy makes two general ways of the analysis in question possible. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> however, that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them seem to have unexpected implications, especially in that it makes our empirical knowledge flowing from immediate perception become not absolutely certain. The alternative: meaninglessness of the term “certain” or uncertainty of that knowledge is what I call “a dilemma” here.

[...] She clarifies this by saying {{it is meant to}} [...] "represent war in general and not a specific historical event". Salcedo is quoted saying [...] "seeing these 1,550 wooden chairs piled high between two buildings in central Istanbul, I’m reminded of mass graves. Of anonymous victims. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> chaos and absence, two effects of wartime violence."

So I’m not narrating a particular story. I’m just addressing experiences.” In 2007, four years after Salcedo’s installation in Istanbul, another artist, Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei, used chairs to create a memory effect in his piece Fairytale. He installed the set of 1001 Ming and Qing dynasty chairs at Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, one chair for each of the 1001 Chinese travelers displaced. His piece focused on Chinese displacement, a similar topic to Salcedo.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} culture is {{everywhere}} invoked and virtually nowhere explained. Culture can mean so many things: collective identity, nation, race, corporate policy, civilization, arts and letters, lifestyle, massproduced popular artifacts, ritual. Law, at first glance, appears easier to grasp if considered {{in opposition to}} culture - as the articulated rules and rights set forth in constitutions, statutes, judicial opinions, the formality of dispute resolution, and the foundation of social order. In most conceptions of culture, law is occasionally a component, but it is most often peripheral or irrelevant. Most visions of law include culture, if they include it at all, as the unavoidable social context of an otherwise legal question - the element of irrationality or the basis of policy conflicts. When law and culture are thought of together, they are conceptualized as distinct realms of action and only marginally related to one another. For example, {{we tend to think}} of playing baseball or going to a baseball game as cultural acts with no significant legal implications. We also assume that a lawsuit challenging baseball 2 ̆ 7 s exemption from antitrust laws is a legal act with few cultural implications. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these assumptions are profoundly wrong, and that our understandings of the game and the lawsuit are impoverished when we fail to account for the ways in which the game is a product of law and the lawsuit a product of culture - how the meaning of each is bound up in the other, and in the complex entanglement of law and culture. If we are to make headway in understanding legal studies as cultural studies and legal practice as cultural practice, then a contingent clarification of the vague concept of culture is an important threshold question. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to understand law not in relationship to culture, as if they were two discrete realms of action and discourse, but to make sense of law as culture and culture as law, and to begin to think about how to talk about and interpret law in cultural terms. This Essay participates in an increasingly lively discussion within law and sociolegal studies about what we ought to mean by culture and what culture can mean for law. These questions have gained urgency of late thanks to recent efforts to investigate the relationship of culture to law, and vice versa, and to make a place in legal studies for a cultural analysis of law. The engine of this investigation has been the popularity and usefulness of the interdisciplinary methods of cultural studies, which have been particularly keen to invade those disciplines, like law, which have traditionally insisted on their own formal integrity. Yet cultural studies suffers from the same definitional distress as culture itself: No one is exactly sure what it means to others and everyone is loath to offer their own working definitions...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|R
6000|$|We enter a small public-house by the {{roadside}} to get a draught of beer. In the kitchen, we behold the landlord and a tall man who is a customer. Both stare {{as a matter of}} course; the tall man especially, after taking one look at our knapsacks, fixes his eyes firmly on us and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying a word--he is evidently prepared for the worst we can do. We get into conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative fellow, who desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection. We ask him, what he thinks we are?--"Well," [...] says the landlord, pointing to my friend's knapsack, which has a square ruler strapped to it, for architectural drawing--"well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you are <b>both</b> <b>of</b> you mappers--mappers who come here to make new roads--you may be coming to make a railroad, I dare say--we've had mappers in the country before this--I know a mapper myself--here's both your good healths!" [...] We drink the landlord's good health in return, and disclaim the honour of being [...] "mappers;" [...] we walk through the country (we tell him) for pleasure alone, and take any roads we can get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord would like to know, if that is the case, why we carry those weights at our backs?--Because we want to take our luggage about with us. Couldn't we pay to ride?--Yes, we could. And yet we like walking better?--Yes we do. This last answer utterly confounds the tall customer, who has been hitherto listening intently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much for his credulity--he pays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word. The landlord appears to be convinced, but it is only in appearance.
