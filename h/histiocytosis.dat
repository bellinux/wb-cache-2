Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell <b>histiocytosis</b> and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
