They {{do not intend to}} predict actual humus dynamics, which are strongly dependent on land-use history and environmental site conditions. Therefore, the validation of <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> methods is a methodical challenge. This paper presents results from the validation of a new method for humus balancing with different approaches. The first validation approach is relating <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> saldi to humus content development in long-term field experiments. The second approach is relating <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> saldi differences between field experiment treatments under similar site conditions to differences in humus dynamics indicators. In both validations the model performed satisfactory. Compared to standard <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> methods applied in organic farming, the new method proved comparable quality in the validation.

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of biogas production in organic farming on soil fertility due to changes in crop rotations {{and the removal of}} carbon from these systems are, at present, unclear. Data from a long-term field trial in Bavaria, Germany were used to evaluate the effects of different crop rotations and fertilization with biogas digestate on maize yields and <b>humus</b> <b>balances.</b> Digestate fertilization led to higher maize yields compared with an unfertilized control.

We evaluate the coefficients for organic farming systems that are comprised in the actual draft revision of the German standard method for <b>humus</b> <b>balancing</b> by VDLUFA. Specific coefficients for organic farming are supported by the N balance in the soil-plant system under organic management, and the coefficients under survey relate to plausible yield levels. The evaluation of the balances without and with application of farming-system specific coefficients in four organic long-term field experiments in Germany showed overall weak correlations of all balances with the test criteria soil C change, winter wheat yield level, and N balance, but balancing with specific coefficients yielded slightly better results than unspecific balancing...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{problems}} caused by soil degradation, it becomes ever more important to estimate the influence of different management systems on soil organic matter (SOM). In the past, a number of indicators characterizing SOM have been elaborated, which, however, do not allow to draw conclusions on separate management measures or even future development tendencies. A promising approach might be <b>humus</b> <b>balancing,</b> which quantifies and evaluates the humus supply of soils {{on the basis of}} crop rotation and fertilization. Comparative studies on adjacent arable sites under both organic and conventional management in different climatic regions of Germany have revealed that the indicator soil organic carbon (SOC) depends mainly on the site conditions, whereas indicators characterizing active SOM like hot water soluble C (Chws), C in microbial biomass (Cmic) and the enzyme activities of β-glucosidase and catalase are stronger related to management methods. It became evident that <b>humus</b> <b>balancing</b> is a good indicator of the active SOM pool and thus also a qualified tool for demonstrating management effects...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{a revised}} version of the German {{standard}} method for <b>humus</b> <b>balancing</b> according to VDLUFA has been published. In contrast to the preceeding version, the method now shall be applicable not only in conventional, but also organic farming systems. In this contribution, we try to define {{the scope of the}} three levels of organic matter demand parameters for crops applied in the method, as an applicable definition is missing in the VDLUFA method description. We do so by calculating crop uptake of mineralized humus-N from the balance parameters, and by linking N uptake to yield levels of crops. Further, we calculate <b>humus</b> <b>balances</b> for farming system treatments in the Organic Arable Farming Experiment Gladbacherhof (Villmar,Germany) and test the ability of the VDLUFA method to differentiate between treatments with regard to their effect on humus levels in relation to each other. We confirm that the method in principle is applicable in organic farming systems, even though the specific scope of the parameter levels should be defined more explicitly. Further, the parametrization of crops (and fertilizers?) should be evaluated in detail, especially with regard to cereals and perennial legumes...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} to what extend data collected in a short term field experiment can be used in the validation of a <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> model. The „hudycrop“ short term field experiment comprised different cropping systems with a uniform previous crop (spring barley), followed by winter wheat, potatoes, red clover (3 cuts/harvested or mulched), all without additional fertilizer application. The sampling design of the experiment was small scaled, assessing biomass as well as soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) changes (0 - 30 cm soil depth) in miniplots (each 1 m²). Soil organic matter (SOM) changes were calculated with consideration to bulk density. Parallel to this, SOM change, based on SOC and STN inputs and outputs, was modelled with the <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> model HU-MOD- 2. All confirmed STN changes are in the line with expectations. Further, an overall positive correlation between predicted SOM changes and measured data does occur. Still, estimated STN changes are stronger than those observed. It is concluded that the experimental design provides the possibility to assess STN changes under single arable crops. In addition the model approach is confirmed in principle, but further calibration is necessary.

40|$|The {{research}} project {{focused on a}} status-quo analysis of long-term field experiments for organic farming in Germany, Austria and the German speaking part of Switzerland. The study comprised long-term field experiments with an expected minimum duration of five years. The status-quo analysis categorized the long-term field experiments into four main research fields: a) system comparison, b) production engineering, c) fertilisation and d) soil fertility and further key aspects. All in all, 47 long-term field experiments were identified. The four main research fields chosen were investigated in 20, 24, 27 and 46 long-term field experiments, respectively. The system comparison of the main research fields identified the major research into “conventional versus organic farming” and “organic farming: ‘stocking ratio’ versus stockless” with eight resp. twelve experiments. In production engineering research focused on “soil cultivation” with 14 experiments.

40|$|Since 2003, a {{long-term}} field {{monitoring of the}} development of Organic Farming has been performed at the bio-farm “Rutzendorf“ in the Marchfeld region east of Vienna. The overall project focus includes three topics: (1) effects of organic farming on soil and plant characteristics depending on three organic fertilization systems (variant 1 : green manure: mulching lucerne; variant 2 : green manure plus communal compost; variant 3 : farmyard manure: harvesting and removal of lucerne crop and cereal straw) (2) effects of hedges on micro climate, water capacity of the soils and crop performances, (3) analyses and cultivation of existing biotopes and establishment of new biotope structures, effects of biotopes and organic farming on the biodiversity of the farm. In the current phase of the project (MUBIL II, 2006 to March 2009), first effects of the conversion have been confirmed and new developments have occurred. (1) Soil monitoring in the period 2003 – 2008 has shown that the concentrations of plant available, CAL-extractable P and K pools remained in the range of “sufficient availability”. An investigation on five additional sites has shown that also for sites with long term organic farming (12 – 18 years) a sufficient or even high availability of P and K can be expected. This assumption is supported by the fact that in all studied soils a very large pool of organically bound phosphorous (which becomes plant available due to microbial degradation) has been detected. Measurements of the soil water balance showed that biologically farmed fields had higher soil water contents than conventional fields, especially in dry years. A significant impact of the kind of fertilization was not observed. Lucerne in the crop rotation had a positive influence on soil physical parameters like bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, aggregate stability and the N mineralization potential. The densities and diversities of the soil fauna (oribatid and gamasid mites and springtails) were very low {{at the onset of the}} study in 2003. Except for the conventional site, the abundance and species richness of Collembola and Gamasida considerably increased in all organic land use types after an initial lag phase. Generally, the conversion to organic farming had a positive effect on Collembola and Gamasida; however, there was no discernible difference between three manure treatments. It is not yet clear if the resulting large numbers will sustain in the following years. Compared to the conventional managed field the number of weed species on the permanent plots is clearly higher but no continuous increase over the investigated years was detected. Under lucerne and under field pea the highest species numbers were found. Due to a decrease in numbers during the following years of the crop rotation, no problems for the practice are assumed. The different fertilizers have neither shown an effect on the emergence of weeds nor on the number of seeds. The yield of winter wheat following lucerne was significantly lower in variant 3 because of the removal of lucerne biomass in this system in contrast to the systems with lucerne mulching. No significantly positive effect of a fertilisation with communal compost and farmyard manure on crop yield has been detected. However, interesting results can be found by analysis of all fertilised trials of the last years. Overall, the fertilisation with farmyard manure (system 3) reached tendentiously the highest crop yields. The communal compost fertilisation did not show so constant results because of the lower nitrogen effect of the compost in contrast to the farmyard manure. The yield development of the three organic fertilization systems was confirmed by the results of nutrient and <b>humus</b> <b>balances</b> calculated with the agro software REPRO. The nutritional value of wheat from organic farms has been examined. Based on these results, it is recommended to conduct regular feed analysis, implying crude protein analysis at least, if home-grown grains are fed to livestock on organic farms. Variant 1 achieved the highest average gross margin during the six years period. The assumed costs for the organic manure in variant 2 and 3 could not be covered by higher revenues. The main influence on the level of the gross margin was, among the climatic conditions, the fluctuating prices of the cash crops during the sample period. (2) Field studies have shown a total sphere of influence of hedgerows in relation to their orientation, permeability and height of about the 15 to 20 fold of the height. Furthermore, available water resulting from precipitation, reduced evapotranspiration due to wind breaks or dislocation of snow has a high impact on (soil) water balance and hence on agriculture at this relatively dry location in Rutzendorf. The impact of the hedgerow lead to reduced water losses and higher soil water contents within a distance of 3 times the barrier height. These positive effects were higher in years with low precipitation amounts. Furthermore a positive effect of a hedge on crop yield in the adjacent field was shown. Yield increases ranged from 9. 5 to 23. 7 percent depending on the cultivated crop, the temperature and the amount of rain in the period of growth. (3) Hedges and tree rows on the farm proved to be species-poor and the structure is more and more degenerating. Therefore cultivation measures have been identified to improve the multi-functionality of landscape elements as well as biodiversity. These measures have been mapped in a preservation concept for the biotope structures. Along hedges and between fields 6 m broad “eco-stripes” were established. An increase in species diversity was achieved by sowing authochthonal wild flowers in one part of the stripes. In the other part of the stripes, which was left to natural succession, low diversity was recorded. A total of 139 species of wild bees was recorded in the project area Rutzendorf. The results show high diversity and rare species in five year old “eco-stripes” in the east. The species richness of two year old “eco-stripes” was also high, but only euryeicous species were found. Carabids and hoover flies were accumulated in and alongside the eco-stripes due to their rich blossom supply. By single-plant countings of pea aphids and their antagonists in three different distances of a flowering strip, lower aphid densities were recorded close to the eco-stripe. These could not be attributed to higher beneficial efficacy there. The spatial distribution of arthropod group numbers emphasizes the significance of hedges and eco-stripes for arthropod biodiversity. In 2006 - 2008, the territories of breeding birds in the research area Rutzendorf were censused using the mapping method. The impoverished breeding bird community was dominated by skylark and pheasant. Diversity and abundance of breeding birds have clearly increased since the beginning of the project in 2003...|$|R

Applying a dynamic <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> model that was parametrized based on data from agrostatistical reports we yielded comparable balances for the two farming systems. The reason was mainly a considerably lower stocking on organic farms, and the low N supply. However: a superior cropland structure brought the balance to the same level as with conventional agriculture despite of these factors. Due to shortcomings in model parametrization caused by the available data base, results may not be over-interpreted.

40|$|Since 2002, {{the federal}} {{research}} programme for organic agriculture has supported research projects on soil fertility. Research projects {{at the beginning}} studied specific subject areas such as comparison of various mulch materials, nutrient mobilisation (especially phosphorus), <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> and soil erosion. This addressed gaps especially in methods in organic practice, where data acquired from conventional agriculture are not applicable. From 2008, the research on soil fertility significantly increased {{and there was a}} special focus on interdisciplinary systems approaches. The joint research project on the management of soil fertility in organic farming, for example, examined a number of factors that interact in this field, such as tillage and soil compaction, fertilisers, green manures and cover crops, weed and disease pressure, crop species and yield levels, energy consumption and the use of machinery, but also cost-benefit analyses of promoting soil fertility and recommendations for farmers. Other projects addressing the need to increase soil fertility investigated the influence of agronomic management measures on soil quality, and of various aspects of reduced tillage; these projects continue the idea of the systems approach. In 2011 a status quo analysis of long-term field experiments in German-speaking countries was conducted, which included comparisons of systems employed to study the long-term impact of management measures on soil fertility, and to identify further research needs. Important results from individual projects on soil fertility are presented below. Based on new data, recommendations are given on the use of different mulching materials and effects on soil moisture and nutrient content. Also results relevant for practitioners were derived from the revision of the method for estimating soil erosion, and concrete suggestions for new methods were made.

40|$|Diversity in {{the quality}} of organic manure {{produced}} on farms in West Africa: what impact on recommendations for the use of manure?. The maintenance of <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> in cultivated soils is a guarantee of the sustainability of production systems. In West Africa, the advice regarding application of organic manure to fields remains unique and independent of the quality of organic manures available on farms. Some studies show that West African farms produce a diversity of organic manure. Should the advice for organic manure application be reformulated to reflect this diversity of farm-produced organic manure? We propose to analyze the diversity of organic manure produced on certain farms and estimate the optimal amount of organic fertilizer that should be applied to the fields to ensure the renewal of organic matter. The analysis distinguishes a great heterogeneity of farm-produced organic manure. Farm-produced manure with a high amendment value provides a reference for the quality of the manure, but this is also the case for farm-produced manure with an average quality and for farm-produced composts with a high or average amendment value. Depending {{on the quality of the}} manure, with these types of organic fertilizer, it would be necessary to apply between 2. 4 and 5. 1 t·ha- 1 per year on sandy soils and 2. 1 to 4. 4 t·ha- 1 per year for clay. Depending on the quality of the compost, it would be necessary to apply between 4. 1 and 5. 4 t·ha- 1 per year for sandy soils and between 3. 5 and 4. 6 t·ha- 1 per year for clay. Taking into account the heterogeneity of the quality of farm-produced organic manure, we can adapt the current technical advice to ensure a renewal of soil organic matter. However, the quantities of organic manure needed are beyond the current capacity of farms. It would be necessary to increase the amount of organic manure produced on farms, to improve its quality and to integrate other modes of soil fertility management at farm level...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the role of livestock in smallholder mixed farming systems, and to determine variations in livestock inventory in relation to changes in socio-economic status and rural population density in the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia. Livestock feed balance, household food adequacy level, and soil <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> of annually cropped plots were identified as proxy indicators of sustainability. The long-term dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system within the evolving livelihood system was also examined. The study showed that farmers and experts differed in their views regarding livestock production objectives, constraints and development measures. Farmers in different well-being categories varied in their livestock inventories, showing differences in their production strategies and needs. Only poor farmers had enough feed to meet maintenance requirement of their livestock while others were largely deficit. Feed balance results failed to portray field reality, as knowledge about tropical feeds and the adaptive potentials of indigenous breeds is limited, undermining the potential use of feed balance as an indicator of sustainability of smallholder mixed farms. Both household energy adequacy levels and the per cent contribution of livestock to total household energy supply varied significantly with well-being categories. Households in medium and well-to-do categories were high in household energy adequacy levels whereas poor households could not meet their energy demands. Also, the estimated soil humus balances of annually cropped plots of poor households were negative whereas those of other farmers were positive, and values increased with higher livestock holding. The variations across districts and across well-being categories were highly significant. Livestock inventory declined with rural population density and increased with socio-economic status, and variations were significant. But the number of livestock per unit area of cultivated land increased significantly with rural population density. The number and overall transport performance of dondeys increased significantly with socio-economic status, indicating the growing importance of non-agricultural activities and signalling a change in livelihood systems and the functions of livestock. The trend and dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system was also studied, using system dynamics modelling. Complementary and competitive relations among sub-system components were depicted, the critical role of livestock in the livelihood system illustrated, and a conceptual model framework containing key elements and flows developed. As the role of livestock in the livelihood systems remains central, the focus of technology choice and promotion has to shift from crop or livestock to crop and livestock production system. The thesis that as land resources dwindle mixed farming systems will have to specialize or would face involution, does not seem to hold for the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia, at least in the foreseeable future. Agricultural development initiatives must therefore consider the crucial role of livestock in smallholder mixed farming systems even when farm sizes decline...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS) This {{scheme is}} a {{temporary}} funding source (2002 – 2007 / 2008) especially to support the whole organic farming sector (incl. research) in Germany. In the summer of 2001, the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture commissioned a project team comprised of representatives from associations and science and headed by the Federal Agricultural Research Centre to develop {{a proposal for a}} package of measures to foster organic farming in Germany. A hearing of representatives from trade and industry, associations, consultancy, science and administration laid the foundation for the team's work. Based on this work, the Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture Renate Künast decided to incorporate the proposed measures into the Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS) to translate them into practice. This scheme supplements existing support measures with the aim of improving the basic conditions necessary for expanding organic farming. At the same time, it strives to increase supply and demand on a balanced, sustainable basis. These measures tackle all levels of organic farming, from the production to the consumption of organically produced food. Plans include training and information measures. Emphasis is also being placed on research promotion, the development of new technologies and steps to translate research findings into practice. Currently the FOFS is the main pool of the BMVEL for organic research funding. Subject area Plants / Crop Husbandry Projects on crop husbandry are generally over-represented within the German Federal Organic Farming Scheme. The structure of the German research system in organic agriculture is responsible for this: research capacities for crop production are much larger than in other areas, such as animal husbandry and food research. The main cause for this imbalance {{can be seen in the}} fact that organic farming developed as an alternative, especially to conventional plant production. The main themes within the research area of plants / crop production 1) Plant protection and plant breeding Under the given economic conditions, there is a need for the plant production in Germany to rationalise the measures for soil cultivation up to crop harvest. The growing demand for products of consistent and high quality with a constant availability can only be fulfilled by organic farmers, if their stock is healthy and if they can achieve high yields. Hence, questions concerning plant health and safety are of main importance. This was reflected by the fact that from a total of about 180 projects, 50 were dedicated to organic plant protection. The use of chemical pesticides as applied in conventional farming is forbidden in organic agriculture. Conventional pesticides treat plants symptom-oriented, while organic agriculture works system-oriented. This systemic view includes soil cultivation, crop rotation, the use of disease-resistant varieties and the specific application of biological pesticides, up to the appropriate living conditions for beneficial insects. The projects of the Federal Scheme try to meet these challenges. Therefore, several projects were initiated in the field of plant breeding. These dealt with breeding of resistant crops, such as wheat and fruits. Furthermore, one project addresses the issue, to what extent organic wheat varieties need a special and modified licensing procedure, which is to be established deviant from conventional testing parameters. Plant protection in organic agriculture is far more complex than in conventional agriculture. Thus, its needs to be system-oriented (see above). Nevertheless, it is important that single measures need to be effective. This means that also biological plant protection preparations have to be reliable in their effect. If this is not the case, then they are unable to fulfil their duty in context of soil cultivation, crop rotation and selection of crop variety. Many projects of the Federal Organic Farming Scheme are devoted to the research of active ingredients, their formulations in different concentrations, their compositions, etc. Highly qualified scientists work in such projects. Based on their research topic, the scientists have to analyse and solve relatively isolated research questions. The research results that were presented in October 2003 and November 2004, showed that this can constitute a danger: The clarification of chemical interrelations should not lead to the systematic approach of organic plant protection to get lost. Plant protection in organic farming should not be a simple substitution of conventional methods. The results of single research questions should be re-included into the overall context of the biological cultivation system and also include existing practical experiences. The example of plant protection makes it quite clear, how important and equally difficult it is to fill the requirement of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research with life. A special problem within organic plant protection is the intensive use of the heavy metal copper. At present, there is no alternative available. Nevertheless, there are several projects in viticulture and potato cultivation that deal with the following aspects: which kind of formulation will reduce the copper concentration in the applied medium, what kind of cropping measures will help avoid the use of copper and which active substance can replace copper in the long-term. 2) Plant strengthening preparations The organic pesticides available on the German market are subject to great dynamism. A large amount of preparations, as well as small manufacturers that are sometimes unable to keep up on the market, are responsible for this. Furthermore, there is a category in Germany called “plant strengthening preparations”, which are subject to a simplified licensing procedure. This category does not exist in all European countries. Therefore, it is difficult for the farmers to choose the appropriate preparation for their crops and their cultivation. In order to improve this situation a project was started, which provides a list containing all relevant information about plant strengthening preparations and other inputs available on the market, their components, their effect as defined by the manufacturer, as well as independent research results. This input list is continuously updated. Thus the farmer and the advisor have a transparent overview of all currently available preparations and their usability. Furthermore, the development of improved mechanised repelling methods against thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop) and dock varieties (Rumex spp.), as well as the use of developed prototypes, was subject of projects within the Federal Scheme. 3) Plant nutrition Organic crop production refrains from using supplemental mineral fertiliser, as its availability for the plant is quite predictable. The management within a closed cycle and the use of organic fertilisers is the basis for plant nutrition in organic agriculture. Due to increasing specialisation, organic farming has to deal with a growing number of farms operating with low or without any animals. Therefore, fertiliser from animal husbandry is hardly available to these farms. They have to focus on organic fertilisers of plant origin, and on the design of a sustainable crop rotation. These issues are taken up by the Federal Scheme: e. g. reasons for a depression in harvest and other cultivation problems on farms operating without animal husbandry are being investigated. Furthermore, the effect of fertilisation from leguminous plants in field vegetables or faba bean meal for different crops are studied. For the prediction of available minerals of the organic material, as well as the soil nutrients available in the long-term, importance is placed on the balance of soil humus. The methods used in conventional agriculture cannot simply be applied here. Systematic research on <b>humus</b> <b>balance</b> has not been done. In order to remove this deficit and to supply the organic farmers, as well as the advisors with a balancing method, which is quite accurate and still practical, a broad project was recently started. ...|$|E
