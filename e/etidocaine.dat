50|$|The {{safety and}} {{effectiveness}} of IVRA is well established in clinical literature.Cardiotoxic LA like bupivacaine and <b>etidocaine</b> are contraindicated. It is often preferred for shorter procedures (for up to 2 hours) on the distal limb, especially on the forearm, except when the patient was advised against tourniquet use(like in sickle cell anaemia-risk of massive hemolysis due to low oxygen tension or hemolytic crisis due to slow blood flow) A systematic review of IVRA-related complications found 64 cases reported between 1964 and 2005, which compares favorably against other techniques. The type of anesthetic agent, improper equipment, and technical error are prominent factors in most instances of morbidity related to IVRA. Modern practice now includes various safeguards for improving safety.|$|E
50|$|Protocols vary {{depending}} on local standard procedures and the extremity being operated on. A vast majority of practitioners begin by exsanguinating the limb as Bier did with an elastic bandage(Esmarch bandage), squeezing blood proximally toward the heart, then pneumatic tourniquets are then applied to the limb and inflated 30mmHg above arterial pressure to occlude all blood vessels and then the elastic bandage is removed. The local anesthetic, typically lidocaine(DOC) or prilocaine without adrenaline, is slowly injected as distally as possible into the exsanguinated limb. The veins are filled with the anesthetic and sets in after approximately 6-8 minutes, after which the surgery may begin. Analgesic effect remains for upto 2 hours.The wait time is important for avoiding toxic levels of anesthetics in the systemic bloodstream {{which can lead to}} hypotension convulsions and even death in extreme cases so, cardiotoxic LA like bupivacaine and <b>etidocaine</b> are strictly contraindicated.|$|E
40|$|When {{changes in}} {{isometric}} tension of helical strips of dog saphenous veins were recorded, <b>etidocaine</b> caused a dose dependent {{depression of the}} contractile responses to nerve stimulation, norepinephrine and K+. The response to nerve stimulation was significantly more depressed than that to exogenous norepinephrine. Similar results were obtained with lidocaine. In preparations incubated in solutions containing 3 H norepinephrine and mounted for superfusion and isometric tension recording, <b>etidocaine</b> depressed the contractions and diminished the release of 3 H norepinephrine evoked by nerve stimulation. Thus, {{in addition to an}} inhibitory effect on the responses of smooth muscle cells, amide linked local anesthetic agents such as <b>etidocaine</b> depress adrenergic neurotransmission in the blood vessel wall, which helps explain their vasodilator properties in the intact organism. In unstimulated preparations and during contractions caused by K+, <b>etidocaine</b> increased the efflux of 3 H norepinephrine and deaminated metabolites. After incubation with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline, <b>etidocaine</b> augmented markedly the efflux of 3 H norepinephrine. During responses to tyramine, it augmented the release of 3 H norepinephrine more than the efflux of deaminated compounds. This suggests that <b>etidocaine</b> augments the leakage of norepinephrine out of the storage vesicles, making more catecholamines available for intraneuronal deamination. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of long-acting local anesthetics for anesthesia during periodontal surgery and for analgesia during the immediate postoperative period was evaluated. The rationale for using long-acting local anesthetics such as <b>etidocaine</b> and bupivacaine {{is that they}} can provide surgical anesthesia and, because of their long duration, prevent discomfort that may occur for 4 - 6 hours postoperatively. Two clinical trials were performed. The first enrolled patients requiring bilateral periodontal surgery. Using a matched pair design and double-blind randomized study conditions, 2 % lidocaine 1 / 100, 000 epinephrine was compared with 1. 5 % <b>etidocaine</b> 1 / 200, 000 epinephrine for periodontal surgery. The time until complete recovery and the time until pain onset were found to be longer for the <b>etidocaine</b> surgeries. Postoperative pain appeared more severe, and the need for oral analgesics was greater for the lidocaine surgeries. Surgeons' rating of surgical bleeding was significantly greater for the <b>etidocaine</b> procedures. When matched bilateral surgeries were not available, a second double-blind randomized parallel trial was performed that compared 1. 5 % <b>etidocaine</b> 1 / 200, 000 epinephrine to 0. 5 % bupivacaine 1 / 200, 000 epinephrine.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has been used to study a local anesthetic, phospholipids and their interactions with drugs and alcohols. The first part of this dissertation is focused on the studies of the solution structure of the local anesthetics, <b>etidocaine</b> and <b>etidocaine</b> hydrochloride. The second part of this dissertation is focused on the NMR studies of phospholipids and their interactions with alcohols or drugs. 1 H and C NMR chemical shift assignments for <b>etidocaine</b> and <b>etidocaine</b> hydrochloride were obtained by using homonuclear and heteronuclear (C/ 1 H) chemical shift correlation 2 D NMR experiments. NMR studies of <b>etidocaine</b> hydrochloride at different temperatures and in different solvents gave information about proton exchange in this drug. The preferred conformations of <b>etidocaine</b> and <b>etidocaine</b> hydrochloride were determined by energy minimization calculations. Two conformations were found for each diastereomer. The differences between the conformations are predominantly in the central portion of the molecule. The lower energy conformer gave the best agreement with the results from 2 D NOE experiments. The NMR studies of phospholipids and their interactions with drugs are {{in the second part of}} this dissertation. 1 H and C assignments of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOL) and dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine (DEL) were determined by 2 D NMR methods. The coupling constants of these phospholipids were obtained from 1 H homonuclear J-resolved experiments. The interactions between sonicated phospholipid vesicles and drugs or alcohols were studied by 1 H spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) measurements and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments. The results indicate that the drugs which we used are located very close to the headgroups of lipids in both the inner and outer bilayer of the lipid vesicle. The effect of the drug is to loosen the structure of the vesicle, thereby increasing the motional freedom of the headgroup protons. The T 1 measurements of DOL with <b>etidocaine</b> hydrochloride at pH = 7. 5 show that the free base form of the local anesthetic is able to penetrate more deeply into the nonpolar region of the lipid bilayers as the pH of the solution is raised...|$|E

The efficacy of the sensory blockade, measured by the incidence of discomfort during the surgical procedure and the require-ments for supplementary nnnigi-nia or general anaesthesia, was greater in the bupivacaine groups compared with the <b>etidocaine</b> group. Measurement of plasma bupivacaine concentrations in 34 of the patients revealed significantly increased umbilical venous concentrations at the time of birth in those who received 0. 75 % bupivacaine (P < 0. 05). There was no advantage in the use of bupivacaine in concentrations exceeding 0. 5 %. <b>Etidocaine</b> 1. 5 % may be of some value in situations where minimal delay in establishing adequate extradural blockade for surgery is desirable, but in view of its comparatively poor analgesic effects, routine use is not recommended.

Because of their amphiphilic molecular structure, both drugs intercalate between the lipid molecules, increasing {{the surface area}} and imparting a positive electric charge onto the membrane. The ultraviolet (UV) binding isotherms were therefore analyzed {{in terms of a}} model which specifically took into account the bilayer expansion as well as the charge-induced concentration variations near the membrane surface. By formulating a quantitative expression for the change in surface area upon drug intercalation and combining it with the Gouy-Chapman theory, the binding of charged dibucaine and <b>etidocaine</b> to the lipid membrane was best described by a partition equilibrium, with surface partition coefficients of 660 +/- 80 M- 1 and 11 +/- 2 M- 1 for dibucaine and <b>etidocaine,</b> respectively (pH 5. 5, 0. 1 M NaCl/ 50 mM buffer). Deuterium magnetic resonance demonstrated further that the binding of drug changed the head-group conformation of the lipid molecules.

40|$|Plasma {{concentrations}} of local anaesthetic agents have been measured after 40 interscalene brachial plexus blocks in 39 patients, using lignocaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine and <b>etidocaine.</b> Lignocaine produced greater concentrations than prilocaine; and bupivacaine greater concentrations than <b>etidocaine.</b> The addition of adrenaline resulted in much lower {{concentrations in the}} case of all four agents. The interscalene approach to the brachial plexus offers the anaesthetist the possibility of producing regional anaesthesia of the upper limb without some of the disadvantages of the traditional methods. Both supraclavicular and axillary approaches may be com-plicated by arterial puncture, and the supraclavicular approach by pneumothorax. Unless very large volumes of local anaesthetic are used for the axillary route, anaesthesia of the shoulder is not obtained and this route is unreliable for blocking the musculo-cutaneous nerve (De Jong, 1961). These problems may be avoided by the use of the interscalene technique. It is also claimed to be the easiest of the three methods (Winnie, 1970). However, poor technique may lead to subarachnoid, extradural or vertebral artery injection; spread of solution to the upper cervical nerves may produce phrenic nerve block. Winnie (1970) did not encounter any of these complications in "many hundreds of cases " but he did note slowness of onset of analgesia in the distri-bution of the ulnar nerve. The interscalene approach has many potential advantages, but large volumes of solution are needed. Winnie (1970) suggested 0. 5 ml of solution for every inch of height in adults and Ward (1974) used 30 - 35 ml of prilocaine 1. 5 % with 1 : 400 000 adrenaline. The use of such volumes may exceed the limit of toxicity for some drugs.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} test the {{requirement}} of Na channel inactivation for the action of local anesthetics, we investigated the inhibitory effects of quaternary and tertiary amine anesthetics on normally inactivating and noninactivating Na currents in squid axons under voltage clamp. Either the enzymatic mixture pronase, or chloramine-T (CT), a noncleaving, oxidizing reagent, was used to abolish Na channel inactivation. We found that both the local anesthetics QX- 314 and <b>etidocaine,</b> when perfused internally at 1 mM, elicited a "tonic" (resting) block of Na currents, a "time-dependent " block that increased during single depolarizations, and a "use-dependent " (phasic) block that accumulated {{as a result of}} repetitive depolarizations. All three effects occurred in both control and CT-treated axons. As in previous reports, little time-dependent or phasic block by QX- 314 appeared in pronase-treated axons, although tonic block remained.

40|$|Effects of {{some local}} anesthetics were studied in patch clamp {{experiments}} on enzymatically demyelinated peripheral amphibian nerve fibers. Micromolar concentrations of external bupivacaine depolarized the excised membrane considerably. The flicker K+ channel {{was found to}} be the most sensitive ion channel to local anesthetics in this preparation. Half-maximum inhibiting concentrations (IC 50) for extracellular application of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, <b>etidocaine,</b> mepivacaine, lidocaine, and QX- 314 were 0. 21, 4. 2, 8. 6, 56, 220, and > 10, 000 microM, respectively. The corresponding concentration-effect curves could be fitted under the assumption of a 1 : 1 reaction. Application from the axoplasmic side resulted in clearly lower potencies with IC 50 values of 2. 1, 6. 6, 16, 300, 1, 200, and 1, 250 microM, respectively. The log(IC 50) -values of the local anesthetics linearly depended on the logarithm of their octanol:buffer distribution coefficients with two regression lines for the piperidine derivatives and the standard amino-amides indicating an inherently higher potency of the cyclic piperidine series. Amide-linked local anesthetics did not impair the amplitude of the single-channel current but prolonged the time of the channel to be in the closed state derived as time constants tau c from closed-time histograms. With <b>etidocaine</b> and lidocaine tau c was 133 and 7. 2 ms, and proved to be independent of concentration. With the most potent bupivacaine time constants of wash in and wash out were 1. 8 and 5. 2 s for 600 nM bupivacaine. After lowering the extracellular pH from 7. 4 to 6. 6, externally applied bupivacaine showed a reduced potency, whereas at higher pH of 8. 2 the block was slightly enhanced. Intracellular pH of 6. 4, 7. 2, 8. 0 had almost no effect on internal bupivacaine block. It is concluded that local anesthetics block the flicker K+ channel by impeding its gating but not its conductance. The slow blocker bupivacaine and the fast blocker lidocaine compete for the same receptor. Lipophilic interactions are of importance for blockade but besides a hydrophobic pathway, there exists also a hydrophilic pathway to the binding site which could only be reached from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Under physiological conditions, blockade of the flicker K+ channel which is more sensitive to bupivacaine than the Na+ channel might lead via membrane depolarization and the resulting sodium channel inactivation to a pronounced block of conduction in thin fibers...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} how epidural anesthesia changes intrathoracic gas volume, high epidural anesthesia {{was administered to}} five pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs lying supine, and the total intrathoracic volume at end-expiration was measured with a high-speed three-dimensional x-ray scanner. The amount of gas in the lungs at end-expiration [the functional residual capacity (FRC) ] was measured with a nitrogen washout technique, and the intrathoracic tissue volume, including the intrathoracic blood volume, was calculated as the difference between intrathoracic volume at end-expiration and FRC. High epidural anesthesia with the local anesthetic <b>etidocaine</b> to a T- 1 myotomal level significantly (P < 0. 05) increased intrathoracic volume at end-expiration [76 +/- 35 mL (M +/- SD) ] by significantly increasing both intrathoracic tissue volume (33 +/- 15 mL) and FRC (43 +/- 26 mL). Increases in intrathoracic tissue volume were probably caused by increases in intrathoracic blood volume. We conclude that increases in FRC caused by epidural anesthesia in anesthetized dogs lying supine may be minimized by a concurrent increase in intrathoracic blood volume. These results suggest that measurements of thoracic gas volume alone may be insufficient to describe chest wall responses to epidural anesthesia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of sodium currents by local anesthetics and other blocking compounds was studied in perfused, voltage-clamped segments of squid giant axon. When applied internally, {{each of the}} eight compounds studied results in accumulating "use-depnedent" block of sodium currents upon repetitive pulsing. Recovery from block occurs over a time scale of many seconds. In axons treated with pronase to completely eliminate sodium inactivation, six of the compounds induce a time- and voltage-dependent decline of sodium currents after activation during a maintained depolarization. Four of the time-dependent blocking compounds [...] procaine, 9 -aminoacridine, N-methylstrychnine, and QX 572 [...] also induce altered sodium tail currents by hindering closure of the activation gating mechanism.

40|$|Lower {{abdominal}} surgery, {{vascular surgery}} and orthopaedic procedures {{on the lower}} limbs require good motor blockade. With certain local anaes-thetics, however, {{the correlation between the}} intensity of motor blockade and the quality of sensory blockade seems to be unsatisfactory. During extradural anaesthesia 0. 5 % amethocaine and 1 % <b>etidocaine</b> produce more profound motor paralysis than 0. 5 % bupivacaine (Bromage, 1969; Bromage, Datta and Danford, 1974; Engberg, HolmdahlandEdstrom, 1974). Glucose-free 0. 5 % bupivacaine provides a longer duration of motor blockade than 0. 5 % bupivacaine containing glucose following subarachnoid administration (Bengtsson, Edstrom and Lofstrom, 1983; Kriiger et al., 1983; Axelsson, Edstrom and Widman, 1984). In these investigations the motor blockade in the lower extremities was estimated according to the scale proposed by Bromage (1965). A new method of quantitating muscle strength (Axelsson et al., 1984) can be used to measure the isometric muscle strength in the lower extremities in non-anaesthetized patients, and in patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia. The aims of this investigation were: (1) to test this method clinically, and to compare the degrees of sensory and motor blockade provided by the subarachnoid injection of 0. 5 % bupivacaine 4 ml with and without glucose; and (2) to compare the objectively recorded changes in muscle strength with the results using a modified Bromage scale, and with sensory blockade as assessed by pin-prick...|$|E

Patients received a mean volume of 16. 5  (SD 4) ml (range 9 - 22 ml) of a mixture of <b>etidocaine,</b> bupivacaine, and hyaluronidase. Ocular compression duration was at least 20  minutes and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with a Tonopen after injection, compression, and before trephination. Degree of akinesia, pain scoring, complications, and surgical conditions were studied.  RESULTS—Before trephination, IOP was 5. 73  mm Hg below the preinjection value and was never above 21  mm Hg. Akinesia was complete in 80 % of cases and 94 % of patients found that surgery was painless. Two patients (2 %) were very agitated during surgery.

Helical strips were incubated with 3 H-noradrenaline and mounted for superfusion and measurement of the efflux of labelled transmitter and its metabolites; in certain experiments the tissue content of 3 H-noradrenaline and its metabolites was also determined. The MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline, and the non-specific inhibitor pargyline, but not the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl decreased the appearance of deaminated and O-methylated deaminated metabolites under basal conditions and during electrical stimulation. The MAO-A and the non-specific MAO inhibitor did not decrease the efflux of VMA to the same extent as that of the other deaminated metabolites. During superfusion with <b>etidocaine,</b> an agent causing increased leakage of stored transmitter, clorgyline abolished the appearance of DOPEG. Addition of semicarbazide in preparations treated with pargyline did not affect the efflux of deaminated and O-methylated deaminated metabolites. From the measurement of tissue VMA, it appeared that the efflux of VMA poorly reflects quick changes in the rate of its formation but that formation is abolished by pretreatment with pargyline. These experiments indicate that in the canine saphenous vein: (1) DOPEG is formed mainly in intraneuronal sites, while DOMA, MOPEG and VMA are formed extraneuronally; (2) VMA is retained in the tissue after its formation; and (3) the only subtype of MAO involved in the metabolism of 3 H-noradrenaline released from adrenergic nerve endings can be classified as MAO-A. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose, An {{in vitro}} study {{was carried out}} to {{determine}} the iontophoretic permeability of local anesthetics through human epidermis. The relationship between physicochemical structure and the permeability of these solutes was then examined using an ionic mobility-pore model developed to define quantitative relationships. Methods. The iontophoretic permeability of both ester-type anesthetics (procaine, butacaine, tetracaine) and amide-type anesthetics (prilocaine, mepivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, <b>etidocaine,</b> cinchocaine) were determined through excised human epidermis over 2 hrs using a constant d. c. current and Ag/AgCl electrodes. Individual ion mobilities were determined from conductivity measurements in aqueous solutions. Multiple stepwise regression was applied to interrelate the iontophoretic permeability of the solutes with their physical properties to examine {{the appropriateness of the}} ionic mobility-pore model and to determine the best predictor of iontophoretic permeability of the local anesthetics. Results. The logarithm of the iontophoretic permeability coefficient (log PCj,iont) for local anesthetics was directly related to the log ionic mobility and MW for the free volume form of the model when other conditions are held constant. Multiple linear regressions confirmed that log PCj,iont was best defined by ionic mobility (and its determinants: conductivity, pK(a) and MW) and MW. Conclusions. Our results suggest that of the properties studied, the best predictors of iontophoretic transport of local anesthetics are ionic mobility (or pK(a)) and molecular size. These predictions are consistent with the ionic mobility pore model determined by the mobility of ions in the aqueous solution, the total current, epidermal permselectivity and other factors as defined by the model...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} uncharged species of lidocaine (LDC) and <b>etidocaine</b> (EDC) on the acyl chain moiety of egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Changes in membrane organization caused by both anesthetics were detected through the use of EPR spin labels (5, 7 and 12 doxyl stearic acid methyl ester) or fluorescence probes (4, 6, 10, 16 pyrene-fatty acids). The disturbance caused by the LA was greater when the probes were inserted in more external positions of the acyl chain and decreased towards the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The results indicate a preferential insertion of LDC at the polar interface of the bilayer and {{in the first half of}} the acyl chain, for EDC. Additionally, 2 H NMR spectra of multilamellar liposomes composed by acyl chain-perdeutero DMPC and EPC (1 : 4 mol%) allowed the determination of the segmental order (S-mol) and dynamics (T- 1) of the acyl chain region. In accordance to the fluorescence and EPR results, changes in molecular orientation and dynamics are more prominent if the LA preferential location is more superficial, as for LDC while EDC seems to organize the acyl chain region between carbons 2 - 8, which is indicative of its positioning. We propose that the preferential location of LDC and EDC inside the bilayers creates a ""transient site"", which is related to the anesthetic potency since it could modulate the access of these molecules to their binding site(s) in the voltage-gated sodium channel.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{features that}} determine the state-dependent interaction of local anaesthetics with voltage-operated sodium channels {{are still a}} matter of debate. We have studied the blockade of sodium channels by 2, 6 -dimethylphenol, a phenol derivative which resembles the aromatic tail of lidocaine, <b>etidocaine,</b> and bupivacaine. The effects of 2, 6 -dimethylphenol were studied on heterologously (HEK 293) expressed rat neuronal (rat brain IIA) and human skeletal muscle (hSkM 1) sodium channels using whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments. 2, 6 -Dimethylphenol was effective in blocking whole-cell sodium inward currents. Its potency was comparable to the potency of lidocaine previously obtained with similar protocols by others. The IC 50 at − 70 mV holding potential was 150 and 187 μM for the skeletal muscle and the neuronal isoform, respectively. In both isoforms, the blocking potency increased with the fraction of inactivated channels at depolarized holding potentials. However, the block achieved at − 70 mV with respect to − 150 mV holding potential was significantly higher only in the skeletal muscle isoform. The estimated dissociation constant Kd from the inactivated state was 25 μM and 28 μM in the skeletal muscle and the neuronal isoform, respectively. The kinetics of drug equilibration between resting and inactivated channel states were about 10 fold faster compared with lidocaine. Our {{results show that the}} blockade induced by 2, 6 -dimethylphenol retains voltage-dependency, a typical feature of lidocaine-like local anaesthetics. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ‘aromatic tail' determines the state-dependent interaction of local anaesthetics with the sodium channel...|$|E
40|$|Members of the voltage-gated-like {{ion channel}} {{superfamily}} have a conserved pore structure. Transmembrane helices {{that line the}} pore (M 2 or S 6) are thought to gate it at the cytoplasmic end by bending at a hinge glycine residue. Proline residues favor bending of α-helices, and substitution of proline for this glycine (G 219) dramatically stabilizes the open state of a bacterial Na+ channel NaChBac. Here we have probed S 6 pore-lining residues of NaChBac by proline mutagenesis. Five of 15 proline-substitution mutants yielded depolarization-activated Na+ channels, but only G 219 P channels have strongly negatively shifted voltage dependence of activation, demonstrating specificity for bending at G 219 for depolarization-activated gating. Remarkably, three proline-substitution mutations on the same face of S 6 as G 219 yielded channels that activated upon hyperpolarization and inactivated very slowly. Studies of L 226 P showed that hyperpolarization to - 147 mV gives half-maximal activation, 123 mV more negative than WT. Analysis of combination mutations and studies of block by the local anesthetic <b>etidocaine</b> favored the conclusion that hyperpolarization-activated gating results from opening of the cytoplasmic gate formed by S 6 helices. Substitution of multiple amino acids for L 226 indicated that hyperpolarization-activated gating was correlated with a high propensity for bending, whereas depolarization-activated gating was favored by a low propensity for bending. Our results further define the dominant role of bending of S 6 in determining not only the voltage dependence but also the polarity of voltage-dependent gating. Native hyperpolarization-activated gating of hyperpolarization- and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in animals and KAT channels in plants may involve bending at analogous S 6 amino acid residues...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{requirement}} of Na channel inactivation for the action of local anesthetics, we investigated the inhibitory effects of quaternary and tertiary amine anesthetics on normally inactivating and noninactivating Na currents in squid axons under voltage clamp. Either the enzymatic mixture pronase, or chloramine-T (CT), a noncleaving, oxidizing reagent, was used to abolish Na channel inactivation. We found that both the local anesthetics QX- 314 and <b>etidocaine,</b> when perfused internally at 1 mM, elicited a "tonic" (resting) block of Na currents, a "time-dependent" block that increased during single depolarizations, and a "use-dependent" (phasic) block that accumulated {{as a result of}} repetitive depolarizations. All three effects occurred in both control and CT-treated axons. As in previous reports, little time-dependent or phasic block by QX- 314 appeared in pronase-treated axons, although tonic block remained. Time-dependent block was greatest and fastest at large depolarizations (Em greater than + 60 mV) for both the control and CT-treated axons. The recovery kinetics from phasic block were the same in control and CT-modified axons. The voltage dependence of the steady state phasic block in CT-treated axons differed from that in the controls; an 8 - 10 % reduction of the maximum phasic block and a steepening and shift of the voltage dependence in the hyperpolarizing direction resulted from CT treatment. The results show that these anesthetics can bind rapidly to open Na channels in a voltage-dependent manner, with no requirement for fast inactivation. We propose that the rapid phasic blocking reactions in nerve are consequences primarily of channel activation, mediated by binding of anesthetics to open channels, and that the voltage dependence of phasic block arises directly from that of channel activation...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated Na+ {{channels}} are the molecular targets of local anesthetics, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, and some anticonvulsants. These chemically diverse drugs inhibit Na+ channels with complex voltage- and frequency-dependent properties that reflect preferential drug binding {{to open and}} inactivated channel states. The site-directed mutations F 1764 A and Y 1771 A in transmembrane segment IVS 6 of type IIA Na+ channel alpha subunits dramatically reduce the affinity of inactivated channels for the local anesthetic <b>etidocaine.</b> In this study, we show that these mutations also greatly reduce the sensitivity of Na+ channels to state-dependent block by the class Ib antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine and the anticonvulsant phenytoin and, to a lesser extent, reduce the sensitivity to block by the class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmic drugs quinidine and flecainide. For lidocaine and phenytoin, which bind preferentially to inactivated Na+ channels, the mutation F 1764 A reduced the affinity for binding to the inactivated state 24. 5 -fold and 8. 3 -fold, respectively, while Y 1771 A had smaller effects. For quinidine and flecainide, which bind preferentially to the open Na+ channels, the mutations F 1764 A and Y 1771 A reduced the affinity for binding to the open state 2 - to 3 -fold. Thus, F 1764 and Y 1771 are common molecular determinants of state-dependent binding of diverse drugs including lidocaine, phenytoin, flecainide, and quinidine, suggesting that these drugs interact with a common receptor site. However, the different magnitude {{of the effects of}} these mutations on binding of the individual drugs indicates that they interact in an overlapping, but nonidentical, manner with a common receptor site. These results further define the contributions of F 1764 and Y 1771 to a complex drug receptor site in the pore of Na+ channels...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} peribulbar anaesthesia was assessed {{using a combination of}} lidocaine, bupivacaine and clonidine during eye surgery. Methods: We prospectively studied 100 vitreo-retinal surgical procedures performed by several surgeons. The exclusion criteria included age below 30 years and, axial length of the orbit above 28 mm. Peribulbar was performed using Hamilton&#x 2032;s technique. A mixed anaesthetic solution of equal quantity of lidocaine 2 &#x 0025; and bupivacaine 0. 5 &#x 0025; with clonidine (1 mg/kg) was injected. Patients received a mean volume of 14. 5 ml &#x 00 B 1; 3. 5 of the mixture. Akinesia and analgesia were assessed 15 minutes later by the surgeon. Whenever required, supplemental lidocaine 2 &#x 0025; (3 ml) by sub- Tenon infiltration was added by the surgeon. Supplemental injections were given only to patients who failed to develop analgesia. Results: The mean age of patients (male 52 &#x 0025;, female 48 &#x 0025;) was 66 years &#x 00 B 1; 10 (mean &#x 00 B 1; SD, range 44 - 90). The 100 surgical procedures were made up of vitrectomy &#x 00 B 1; gas &#x 00 B 1; silicone oil (22 / 100), vitrectomy and lensectomy (6 / 100), vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane &#x 00 B 1; laser coagulation &#x 00 B 1; gas &#x 00 B 1; silicone oil (35 / 100), scleral buckling or encircling &#x 00 B 1; gas (36 / 100), and cryosurgery &#x 00 B 1; gas (1 / 100). Analgesia was adequate throughout surgery without any supplementation in 85 &#x 0025; of cases and with a sub-Tenon infiltration in 99 &#x 0025;. Akinesia was complete in 84 &#x 0025;, mild in 12 &#x 0025; and absent in 4 &#x 0025; of cases. The sub-Tenon injection was performed in 15 &#x 0025; of cases. Three patients (3 &#x 0025;) were agitated during surgery. No neurologic or cardiac complication was seen. In one patient, the systolic blood pressure decreased from 170 to 110 mmHg, 30 minutes after the institution of the peribulbar block. Conclusion: Our results show that peribulbar anaesthesia in the proposed mixture offers excellent analgesia in 85 &#x 0025; of patients, and in 99 &#x 0025; of the patients when supplemented by a subtenon injection. The current mixture of lidocaine, bupivacaine and clonidine is an excellent alternative to the previously used mixture <b>etidocaine,</b> bupivacaine and hyaluronidase for vitreoretinal surgery. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to prove the {{efficacy and}} safety of these results...|$|E
