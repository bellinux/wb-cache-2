5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sons</b> will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> ("Отцы и дети"), Turgenev's {{most famous}} and {{enduring}} novel, appeared in 1862. Its leading character, Eugene Bazarov, considered the 'first Bolshevik' in Russian literature, was in turn heralded and reviled as either a glorification or a parody of the 'new men' of the 1860s. The novel examined {{the conflict between the}} older generation, reluctant to accept reforms, and the nihilistic youth. In the central character, Bazarov, Turgenev drew a classical portrait of the mid-nineteenth-century nihilist. <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> was set during the six-year period of social ferment, from Russia's defeat in the Crimean War to the Emancipation of the Serfs. Hostile reaction to <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> ("Отцы и дети") prompted Turgenev's decision to leave Russia. As a consequence he also lost the majority of his readers. Many radical critics at the time (with the notable exception of Dimitri Pisarev) did not take <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> seriously; and, after the relative critical failure of his masterpiece, Turgenev was disillusioned and started to write less.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> {{might be}} {{regarded}} as the first wholly modern novel in Russian literature (Gogol's Dead Souls, another main contender, was referred to by the author as a poem or epic in prose as in the style of Dante's Divine Comedy, and was at any rate never completed). The novel introduces a dual character study, as seen with the gradual breakdown of Bazarov's and Arkady's nihilistic opposition to emotional display, {{especially in the case of}} Bazarov's love for Madame Odintsova.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, Turgenev {{was unsure}} of the genre of Rudin, {{publishing}} it with a subtitle of ‘novella’. In 1860, it was published together with two other novels, but in the three editions of Turgenev’s Works that followed it was grouped with short stories. In the final, 1880, edition it was again placed {{at the head of}} the novels. The theme of the superfluous man in love was further explored in Turgenev’s subsequent novels, culminating in <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons.</b>|$|E

25|$|Yeshivish is {{primarily}} a male spoken dialect. <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sons,</b> particularly of teenage years and above, might speak Yeshivish, while mothers and daughters generally do not, or they speak a milder variety of it. This can be explained {{as much of the}} Yeshivish lexicon is learned in Yeshivot where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature. Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations. There is a higher incidence of Yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study, or belong to a community that promotes its study.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1980s Istanbul, Master Mahmut and his {{apprentice}} use ancient {{methods to}} dig new wells; {{this is the}} tale of their back-breaking struggle, {{but it is also}} an exploration—through stories and images—of ideas about <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sons,</b> authoritarianism and individuality, state and freedom, reading and seeing. This short, compelling novel is at once a realist text investigating a murder which took place thirty years ago near Istanbul, and a fictional inquiry into the literary foundations of civilizations, comparing two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex (a story of patricide) and Ferdowsi’s tale of Rostam and Sohrab (a story of filicide).|$|E
25|$|Roberts married Nora Henrietta Bews on 17 May 1859; {{they had}} six {{children}} of whom three, {{a son and}} two daughters, survived infancy.

25|$|Following the {{thoughts}} of the influential critic Vissarion Belinsky, Turgenev abandoned Romantic idealism for a more realistic style. Belinsky defended sociological realism in literature; Turgenev portrayed him in Yakov Pasinkov (1855). During the period of 1853-62 Turgenev wrote some of his finest stories {{as well as the}} first four of his novels: Rudin ("Рудин") (1856), A Nest of the Gentry ("Дворянское гнездо") (1859), On the Eve ("Накануне") (1860) and <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons</b> ("Отцы и дети") (1862). Some themes involved in these works include the beauty of early love, failure to reach one's dreams, and frustrated love. Great influences on these works are derived from his love of Pauline and his experiences with his mother, who controlled over 500 serfs with the same strict demeanor in which she raised him.|$|E

25|$|Although the war {{had ended}} in a victory for Japan, Japanese public opinion {{was shocked by the}} very {{restrained}} peace terms which were negotiated at the war's end. Widespread discontent spread through the populace upon the announcement of the treaty terms. Riots erupted in major cities in Japan. Two specific requirements, expected after such a costly victory, were especially lacking: territorial gains and monetary reparations to Japan. The peace accord led to feelings of distrust, as the Japanese had intended to retain all of Sakhalin Island, but were forced to settle for half of it after being pressured by the United States, with President Roosevelt opting to support Nicholas II's stance on not ceding territory or paying reparations. The Japanese had wanted reparations to help families recover from lost <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sons</b> as well as heavy taxation from the government. Without them, they were at a loss.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s a {{movement}} known as Nihilism developed in Russia. A term originally coined by Ivan Turgenev in his 1862 novel <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sons,</b> Nihilists favoured {{the destruction of}} human institutions and laws, {{based on the assumption}} that such institutions and laws are artificial and corrupt. At its core, Russian nihilism was characterized by the belief that the world lacks comprehensible meaning, objective truth, or value. For some time many Russian liberals had been dissatisfied by what they regarded as the empty discussions of the intelligentsia. The Nihilists questioned all old values and shocked the Russian establishment. They moved beyond being purely philosophical to becoming major political forces after becoming involved in the cause of reform. Their path was facilitated by the previous actions of the Decembrists, who revolted in 1825, and the financial and political hardship caused by the Crimean War, which caused large numbers of Russian people to lose faith in political institutions.|$|E
25|$|The year 1634 is {{typically}} interpreted as denoting {{the divide between}} the mediaeval and early modern administration of Bethlem. It {{marked the end of}} the day-to-day management by an old-style keeper-physician and its replacement by a three-tiered medical regime composed of a non-resident physician, a visiting surgeon and an apothecary, a model adopted from the royal hospitals. The medical staff were elected by the Court of Governors and, in a bid to prevent profiteering at the expense of patients that had reached its apogee in Crooke's era, they were all eventually salaried with limited responsibility for the financial affairs of the hospital. Personal connections, interests and occasionally royal favour were pivotal factors in the appointment of physicians, but by the measure of the times appointees were well qualified as almost all were Oxbridge graduates and a significant number were either candidates or fellows of the College of Physicians. Although the posts were strongly contested, nepotistic appointment practices played a significant role. The election of James Monro as physician in 1728 marked the beginning of an 125-year Monro family dynasty extending through four generations of <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sons.</b> Family influence was also significant in the appointment of surgeons but absent in that of apothecaries.|$|E
