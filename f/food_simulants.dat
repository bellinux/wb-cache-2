The total migration was determined gravimetrically in the ethanol and acetic acid <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> at different time and temperature conditions, while migrants were detected by laser diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Swelling, thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were applied to characterize the degradation of polymer films at the migration conditions.

Fast and reliable analytical procedures were developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} the studied AOs in <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> For aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> solid phase extraction followed by GC–MS analysis was performed. Fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were directly analysed by GC–MS and HPLC-UV for isooctane and ethanol 950 mL/L, respectively. The release of AOs from the films was dependent on the type of food stimulant and AO incorporated. In particular, high levels of migration were obtained for both AOs into isooctane, showing thymol higher migration. The release kinetics of AOs from PP films showed a Fichian behaviour with diffusion coefficients ranging from 1 to 2 × 10 − 14 m 2 /s; except for the diffusion into isooctane where 4 - 6 higher values were obtained. The antioxidant activity of migration extracts was confirmed by the DPPH method, showing thymol a higher antioxidant capacity especially into isooctane with a 42. 2 % of inhibition. The obtained results suggest that carvacrol and thymol show a potential use as AOs for active packaging for extending the shelf-life of food products.

40|$|International audienceThe release {{study of}} natural antioxidants, i. e., {{ascorbyl}} palmitate and α-tocopherol, and synthetic phenolic antioxidants including butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) from polylactic acid (PLA) film into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were accomplished. PLA antioxidant films {{were placed in}} contact with 95, 50, and 10  % ethanol at 40 and 20  °C. Released antioxidants were regularly measured by high-performance liquid chromatography system for 60  days. Ascorbyl palmitate was completely degraded during film preparation {{and is not a}} suitable antioxidant for PLA antioxidant-active packaging. The diffusion coefficient (D) and partition coefficient (K) of antioxidants were calculated based on obtained data. Diffusion of the antioxidants from PLA to the simulants showed a Fick's behavior with the diffusion coefficient (D) value between 10 − 9 and 10 − 11  cm 2  s− 1 with 0 ― 100  % of release. Faster and higher release of antioxidants occurred at 40  °C according to Arrhenius law. At 40  °C, TBHQ in 95  % ethanol decomposed to 2 -tert-butyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and other quinone derivatives, and α-tocopherol in 50  % ethanol decomposed to some unknown neoformed compounds. Antioxidants molecular weight, Log P, simulant polarity, and temperature were the most influencing factors on antioxidants release rate from PLA films in contact with <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> The D and K coefficients of studied antioxidants from PLA in three <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> and two temperatures can be used to create PLA antioxidant-active packaging to continually control the oxidation reactions in diverse foodstuffs to ensure higher food qualities. The PLA antioxidant-active packaging approach also permits to reduce the amounts of directly added antioxidants in foods to provide safer foods...|$|E
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{substances}} migrating from plastics into foodstuffs with high fat contents are usually higher than into aqueous foodstuffs. In most cases {{this is due}} to the higher solubility of the migrating organic compunds in fat compared to water and not due to an increase in the diffusion coefficient due to interactions between the fat and plastic as is often assumed. Ethanol and aqueous ethanol mixtures can be good fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> because they interact very little with many plastics, migrants are readily soluble in them and because they are easy to work with analytically. The utilizeable limits of aqueous ethanol and other low molecular weight solvents as <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> are developed from the physical chemical background of partition coefficients and diffusion. The use of ethanol simulants is supported by experimental results for polyolefins and rigid polyvinyl chloride. Other low molecular weight solvents for other classes of polymers are suggested. The UNIFAC activity coeffic ient estimation method is applied to alternative fatty food simulants/polymer systems and estimations for sorption and partition coefficients are compared with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} migration into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated at three different levels in low density polyethylene (LDPE) films was carried out under severe test conditions. It was shown that within the analytical sensitivity of the applied ICP-MS method no measurable migration of titanium was found at detection limits to 0. 09 – 0. 11 μg kg− 1 for the <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> 95 % ethanol and iso-octane and 0. 24 μg kg− 1 for 3 % acetic acid. In addition a migration model generally applicable for nanoparticles was established based on an existing migration model for conventional polymer additives to explore into the migration range below the experimentally accessible detection limits. The modeling results indicate that measurable migration may only occur for NPs up to approximately 3. 5 nm in diameter but not for larger ones. Overall, the conclusion was drawn that due to the usual size, shape and aggregation of NPs in plastics nanocomposites nanomaterials are immobilized in food contact plastics. Exposure of the consumer to nanomaterials via migration from food contact plastics cannot be expected...|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane based {{polymers}} {{are used}} as adhesives in agglomerated cork stoppers. These cork stoppers improve wine quality when comparing to screw caps or foam. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still wines, semi-sparkle and gaseous wines, beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used {{in the production of}} polyurethane based adhesive due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric MDI (fm-MDI) can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages. Therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC with the advantage of decreasing time and solvent consumption. Although optimization is necessary because column and solvent conditions are not the same in both systems. Agglomerated cork stoppers glued with MDI based polyurethane were produced and put in contact with <b>food</b> <b>simulant,</b> ethanol:water 50 : 50, with different times after production. Samples were taken, from each contact time after production, after 15, 60, 120, 360 min, 1 day and 1 month contact period. The same proceeding was also performed using dichloromethane as extraction solvent with agglomerated cork stoppers with two days after production. The samples in contact with <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> (EtOH:H 2 O) was dried with rotary evaporator, dissolved in the appropriated solvent and fm-MDI determined with the analytical method that was optimized. Secondly key parameters of the migration process are expected to be calculated according to a mathematical model based on the second Fick’s equation. Regarding that MDI reacts rapidly very low concentrations of fm-MDI are expected...|$|R
40|$|Volatile {{compounds}} {{generated from}} {{two types of}} polymeric laminated films, irradiated by gamma radiation at 8, 10 and 15 kGy, were investigated. Activated carbon {{was used as a}} dry <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> to trace the migrating compounds by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS). The resulting data showed that the Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) /Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) /Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) film was more resistant to gamma radiation as compared to Biaxial Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) /Cast Polypropylene (CPP) film. Toxic radiolysis products migrated through both laminated films at 8 and 15 kGy gamma irradiation. The toxic products originating from additives formulated in adhesive and in direct food contact layers may be considered as high risk against the safety of dry foodstuffs such as spices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Diffusion {{coefficient}} is {{an important}} quantity that affects any migration process on food or nutritional systems. Special care {{has to be done}} to migration of undesirable substances from packaging into foods, if the diffusion is the only process involved in mass transfer. The Fick´s equation resolution permits to describe the kinetic of migration from polymer packaging into <b>food</b> or <b>simulant,</b> once it was given the correct contour and initial conditions. Another important quantity is the partition coefficient, which quantifies the relation between the final or equilibrium concentrations in polymer and that in the <b>food</b> or <b>simulant.</b> Here it is proposed a simple procedure, based on numerical resolution of the Fick´s equation, where the diffusion coefficient could indirectly be measured, if the kinetic of migration had been measured and the partition coefficient is known...|$|R
