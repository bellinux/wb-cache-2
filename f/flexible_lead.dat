40|$|The Bump on <b>Flexible</b> <b>Lead</b> (BoFL) is a chip-to {{substrate}} interconnect technology {{which uses}} flexible structures {{to accommodate the}} CTE mismatch between the chip and PCB substrate and consequently should be reliable without under fill. To achieve a high flexibility, the lead-free bump is located on a <b>flexible</b> <b>lead.</b> The <b>flexible</b> <b>lead</b> consists of a copper redistribution layer(RDL) embedded in a polyimide-bridge which is located over an air gap. Since the stress due to CTEmismatch is then accommodated within the <b>flexible</b> <b>lead,</b> the risk of solder fatigue decreases. The new failure risks are mainly related to fatigue of the copperRDL. Therefore a design study of the <b>flexible</b> <b>lead</b> by finite element analysis (FEA) was performed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In most {{electronic}} packaging applications {{it is not}} {{a single}} high stress event that breaks a component solder joint; rather it is repeated or prolonged load applications that result in fatigue or creep failure of the solder. The principal strain in solder joints is caused by differential expansion between the part and its mounting environment due to changes in temperature (thermal cycles) and/or due to temperature gradients between the part and the board. The function of strain relief elements [...] such as the <b>flexible</b> metal <b>leads</b> of the electronic components [...] is to lower the differential-expansion induced loads (stresses) on the solder joints to levels well below the solder yield strength, thus significantly reducing the generation of plastic strain. By reducing the developed strain, <b>flexible</b> <b>leads</b> greatly enhance solder joint reliability. Figure 1 - 1 illustrates a variety of <b>flexible</b> <b>leads</b> commo...|$|R

The influence of the thickness of ruthenium dioxide RuO 2 and PZT layers was investigated for Pb(Zr 0. 57 Ti 0. 43) O 3. The modification of Zr/Ti ratio from 40 / 60 to 60 / 40 was done for 3 [*]μm thick PZT thin films onto aluminium (Al) and Al/RuO 2 substrates.

Very large tip deflections of about 1 [*]mm under low voltage (∼ 8 [*]V) were measured for every cantilevers at the resonance frequency (∼ 180 [*]Hz).

40|$|Abstract Custom diamond {{electrodes}} for in vivo, passive electrical nerve recording {{were developed}} and implanted in an intact, freely behaving Aplysia californica. A diamond electrode may have advantages for electrical recording {{because of its}} chemical stability, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and reduced biological fouling relative to traditional nerve-recording electrode materials. For example, thin stainless steel electrodes used for chronic extracellular recording in Aplysia typically last {{on the order of}} seven days in vivo. We have developed a first-generation diamond electrode with a <b>flexible</b> <b>lead</b> to withstand the complicated movements of Aplysia and to enable direct comparison with implanted stainless steel electrodes. Boron-doped polycrystalline diamond was grown onto tungsten wire substrates by hot filament chemical vapor deposition. The wires were pre-shaped into a hook (for nerve recording) or a loop (for a ground wire) and masked for selective growth on only 2 – 3 mm of the wire. After diamond growth, the uncoated portion of the wire substrates was removed and the intact diamond-coated hook or loop attached to a stainless steel electrical lead with conductive epoxy. After epoxy curing, these electrodes were insulated and implanted in the animal. The diamond and stainless steel electrodes were attached extracellularly to buccal nerve 2, a primary nerve for the feeding behavior of A. californica. The two electrodes were implanted adjacent to each other so that the recordings would be nearly synchronous. In vivo recordings were successfully obtained on a diamond hook electrode during a feeding behavior for up to 9 days after the implantation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new <b>flexible</b> <b>lead</b> zirconate titanate (PZT) /polymer composite material {{that can be}} screen-printed onto fabrics and flexible substrates, and investigates the clamping effect of these substrates on the characterization of the piezoelectric material. Experimental {{results showed that the}} optimum blend of PZT/polymer binder with a weight ratio of 12 : 1 provides a dielectric constant of 146. The measured value of the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 was found to depend on the substrate used. Measured d 33 clp values of 70, 40, 36 pC N− 1 were obtained from the optimum formulation printed on Polyester–cotton with an interface layer, Kapton and alumina substrates, respectively. The variation in the measured d 33 clp values occurs because of the effect of the mechanical boundary conditions of the substrate. The piezoelectric film is mechanically bonded {{to the surface of the}} substrate and this constrains the film in the plane of the substrate (the 1 -direction). This constraint means that the perpendicular forces (applied in the 3 -direction) used to measure d 33 introduce a strain in the 1 -direction that produces a charge of the opposite polarity to that induced by the d 33 effect. This is due to the negative sign of the d 31 coefficient and has the effect of reducing the measured d 33 value. Theoretical and experimental investigations confirm a reduction of 13 %, 50 % and 55 % in the estimated freestanding d 33 fs values (80 pC N− 1) on Polyester–cotton, Kapton and alumina substrates, respectively. These results demonstrate the effect of the boundary conditions of the substrate/PZT interface on the piezoelectric response of the PZT/polymer film and in particular the reduced effect of fabric substrates due to their lowered stiffness...|$|E
