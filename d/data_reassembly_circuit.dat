40|$|Abstract: Most {{popular and}} widely used packet switch {{architecture}} is the crossbar. Its attractive characteristics are simplicity, non-blocking {{and support for}} simultaneous multiple packet transmission across the switch. The special version of crossbar switch is Combined Input Crossbar Queue (CICQ) switch. It overcomes the limitations of un-buffered crossbar by employing buffers at each crosspoint in addition to buffering at each input port. Adoption of Crosspoint Buffer (CB) simplifies the scheduling complexity and adapts the distributed nature of scheduling. As a result, matching operation is not needed. Moreover, it supports variable length packets transmission without segmentation. Native switching of variable length packet transmission results in unfairness. To overcome this unfairness, Fixed Length Block Transfer mechanism has been proposed. It has the following drawbacks: (a) Fragmented packets are reassembled at the Crosspoint Buffer (CB). Hence, minimum buffer requirement at each crosspoint is twice the maximum size of the block. When number of ports are more, existence of such a switch is infeasible, due to the restricted memory available in switch core. (b) <b>Reassembly</b> <b>circuit</b> at each crosspoint adds {{the cost of the}} switch. (c) Packet is eligible to transfer from CB to output only when the entire packet arrives at the CB, which increases the latency of the fragmented packet in the switch. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents Variable Length Block Transfer mechanism. It does not require internal speedup, segmentation and <b>reassembly</b> <b>circuits.</b> Using simulation it is shown that proposed mechanism is superior to Fixed Length Block Transfer mechanism in terms of delay and throughput...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} widely used {{architectures}} for packet switches is the crossbar. A special version of a it is the buffered crossbar, where small buffers are associated with the crosspoints. The advantages of this organization, when compared to the unbuffered architecture, is that it needs much simpler and slower scheduling circuits, while it can shape the switched traffic according to a given set of Quality of Service (QoS) criteria in a more efficient way. Furthermore, by supporting variable length packets throughout a buffered crossbar: a) {{there is no need for}} segmentation and <b>reassembly</b> <b>circuits,</b> b) no internal speedup is necessary, and c) synchronization between the input and output clock domains is simplified. In this paper we present an architecture, a hardware implementation analysis, and a performance evaluation of such a buffered crossbar. The proposed organization is simple, yet powerful and can be easily implemented using today’s technologies. Our evaluation shows that it outperforms most of the existing packet switch architectures, while its hardware cost is kept to a minimum. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of connectionless data {{is necessary for}} the compatibility of emerging wide area ATM networks with existing computer networks. This paper investigates the design and performance of a virtual connectionless network overlayed on top of cell-based connectionoriented ATM networks. The virtual connectionless network is made possible by utilizing connectionless servers. Two packet forwarding techniques used by connectionless servers are examined. Forwarding connectionless packets in a cell-by-cell manner (streaming mode) is shown to result in lower packet loss and end-to-end delay than packet-by-packet forwarding of connectionless <b>data</b> (<b>reassembly</b> mode). A design and implementation are presented for a streaming mode connectionless server capable of a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps. 3 This research is supported by grants from the University of California MICRO program, Nippon Steel Information and Communication Systems Inc.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in parallel computing over large scale clusters is fast and scalable process startup, which typically {{can be divided into}} two phases: process initiation and connection setup. In this paper, we characterize the startup of MPI programs in InfiniBand clusters and identify two startup scalability issues: serialized process initiation in the initiation phase and high communication overhead in the connection setup phase. To reduce the connection setup time, we have developed one approach with <b>data</b> <b>reassembly</b> to reduce <b>data</b> volume, and another with a bootstrap channel to parallelize the communication. Furthermore, a process management framework, Multi-Purpose Daemons (MPD) system is exploited to speed up process initiation. Our experimental results show that job startup time has been improved by more than 4 times for 128 -process jobs, and the improvement can be more than two orders of magnitude for 2048 process jobs as suggested by our analytical models. ...|$|R

The startup of a parallel job typically can be divided into two phases: process initiation and connection setup. Both of these phases can become performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we characterize the startup of MPI programs in InfiniBand clusters and identify two startup scalability issues: serialized process initiation in the initiation phase and high communication overhead in the connection setup phase. We propose different approaches to reduce communication overhead and provide fast process initiation. Specifically, to reduce the connection setup time, we have developed one approach with <b>data</b> <b>reassembly</b> to reduce <b>data</b> volume and another with a bootstrap channel to parallelize the communication.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a Bluetooth channel state {{dependent}} <b>data</b> segmentation and <b>reassembly</b> (CSD-SAR) scheme and a queue state dependent priority (QSD-PR) scheduling policy. The CSD-SAR maintains a receiving frequency table to predict channel conditions and selects the best packet type and packet size to transmit data. In addition, the QSD-PR also uses the receiving frequency table to avoid bad frequencies {{and gives a}} selected master-slave pair, which has more queued data to send between each other and has a higher priority to eliminate the wastage of slots. The conventional scheduling policy, Round Robin (RR), yields poor performance with the time division duplex (TDD) based MAC protocol and results in slot wastage and may not ensure fairness. Simulation results show that OUT proposed scheme achieves better link utilization and higher throughput with bounded delay compared to the RR scheme in error-free and error-prone environments. Our scheme can also eliminate interference to other wireless networks that share the same spectrum, such as WLANs, by avoiding selecting channels occupied by other network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the programmable protocol processor (PRO 3) architecture, which {{is capable of}} supporting advanced security services over high-speed networks. Security services include such things as a firewall, packet and flow classification, connection-state handling (i. e., stateful inspection), higher-layer protocol <b>data</b> unit (PDU) <b>reassembly</b> (i. e., application-level firewalls), and packet encryption and decryption. The PRO 3, which is integrated with a high-speed line card, attempts to accelerate {{the performance of the}} firewall by implementing key functionality in hardware and by optimizing the balance between hardware and software functions. In this way, significant performance enhancements can be achieved, such as making transport control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) data transactions secure, and protecting and separating virtual private networks (VPNs) from the external public network. The PRO 3 incorporates an innovative scheme—a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) -based pipelined module with line-rate throughput—that makes it possible to process high- and low-level streaming operations efficiently. Using microcode profiling and simulation, we give performance results for a stateful-inspection firewall application with network address translation (NAT) support. © 2003 Lucent Technologies Inc...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} the production of malformed virus-like-particles (VLP) in recombinant host systems. Here we computationally investigate {{the case of a}} large triple-layered rotavirus VLP (RLP). In vitro assembly, disassembly and <b>reassembly</b> <b>data</b> provides strong evidence of microscopic reversibility of RLP assembly. Light scattering experimental data also evidences a slow and reversible assembly untypical of kinetic traps, thus further strengthening the fidelity of a thermodynamically controlled assembly. In silico analysis further reveals that under favourable conditions particles distribution is dominated by structural subunits and completely built icosahedra, while other intermediates are present only at residual concentrations. Except for harshly unfavourable conditions, assembly yield is maximised when proteins are provided in the same VLP protein mass composition. The assembly yield decreases abruptly due to thermodynamic equilibrium when the VLP protein mass composition is not obeyed. The latter effect is more pronounced the higher the Gibbs free energy of subunit association is and the more complex the particle is. Overall this study shows that the correct formation of complex multi-layered VLPs is restricted to a narrow range of association energies and protein concentrations, thus the choice of the host system is critical for successful assembly. Likewise, the dynamic control of intracellular protei...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter fertilization, ribosomal RNA {{synthesis}} is silenced {{during a}} period which depends on the species. <b>Data</b> concerning the <b>reassembly</b> of a functional nucleolus remain scarce. We have examined by immunocytochemistry, Western blots, and BrUTP microinjection the dynamics of major nucleolar proteins during the first cycles of mouse embryogenesis, in relation to rDNA transcription sites and coilin, a marker of Cajal bodies. We show that: (1) the reinitiation of rDNA transcription occurs at the two-cell stage, 44 – 45 h after hCG injection (hphCG), at {{the surface of the}} nucleolar precursor bodies (NPBs), where the RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription complex is recruited 4 – 5 h before; (2) the NPBs are not equal in their ability to support recruitment of pol I and rDNA transcription; (3) maternally inherited fibrillarin undergoes a dynamic redistribution during the second cell stage, together with coilin, leading to the assembly of the Cajal body around 40 hphCG; and (4) the pol I complex is first recruited to the Cajal body before reaching its rDNA template. We also find that fibrillarin and B 23 are both directly assembled around NPBs prior to ongoing pre-rRNA synthesis. Altogether, our results reveal a role of the Cajal bodies in the building of a functional nucleolus...|$|R
