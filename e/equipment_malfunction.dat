5|$|When {{fin whale}} sounds were first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction,</b> geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|E

25|$|The cost {{of adding}} {{fluoridation}} {{to the water}} of 44 Florida communities has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee.

The estimated cost rises to $2.12 per person in areas with a population below 10,000.

25|$|The Revolution was a heel {{stable of}} younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never {{gave them the}} chance to be stars, pushing older, more {{established}} wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match. In October 1999 on Nitro in Kansas City, Missouri, Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to Owen Hart, who had recently died due to an <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction.</b> Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, Harley Race.|$|E

500|$|The {{incidence}} of {{central nervous system}} toxicity among divers has decreased since the Second World War, as protocols have developed to limit exposure and partial pressure of oxygen inspired. In 1947, Donald recommended limiting the depth allowed for breathing pure oxygen to , which equates to an oxygen partial pressure of [...] Over time this limit has been reduced, until today a limit of [...] during a recreational dive and [...] during shallow decompression stops is generally recommended. Oxygen toxicity {{has now become a}} rare occurrence other than when caused by <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction</b> and human error. Historically, the U.S. Navy has refined its Navy Diving Manual Tables to reduce oxygen toxicity incidents. Between 1995 and 1999, reports showed 405 surface-supported dives using the helium–oxygen tables; of these, oxygen toxicity symptoms were observed on 6 dives (1.5%). As a result, the U.S. Navy in 2000 modified the schedules and conducted field tests of 150 dives, none of which produced symptoms of oxygen toxicity. Revised tables were published in 2001.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his 47 wins, Luongo recorded a 2.29 GAA (which was at that time, a personal best) and a team-record [...]921 save percentage (surpassing Dan Cloutier's [...]914 save percentage in 2003–04; later broken by Cory Schneider's [...]929 save percentage in 2010–11). He won three team awards – the Cyclone Taylor Trophy as MVP, the Molson Cup as the player with the most three-star selections, and the Most Exciting Player Award. Leading the Canucks to a Northwest Division title and {{what was then a}} franchise record of 105 points, the team was seeded third in the Western Conference. The 2007 playoffs marked Luongo's first NHL post-season appearance. Facing the Dallas Stars in the opening round, he almost set an NHL record for most saves in a playoff game in his post-season debut. He stopped 72 shots, en route to a 5–4 quadruple overtime victory, one save shy of Kelly Hrudey's 73-save mark set in 1987. Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games. They were, however, defeated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Anaheim Ducks. Luongo put forth a losing 56-save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks. After the game ended in regulation at a 1–1 tie, he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction.</b> However, after the series ended, it was revealed that Luongo, instead, had an untimely case of diarrhea. The Canucks lost the game 2–1 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee, believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. With Luongo not paying attention, Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the series-winning goal.|$|E

Due to past mechanical problems, the bombardier was briefed to open the bomb bay doors at the Initial Point (IP). Although the bomber's bombing navigation radar {{was still in the}} navigation mode, the bomb dropped unexpectedly when the bay doors were opened, and the [...] of high explosives in the weapon burst in the air over a non-designated target area.

[...] Following a short-notice decision to deploy, the first batch of six aircraft were readied to deploy in under 72hours, including the adoption of desert camouflage, and additional equipment, and departed from Lossiemouth for the Middle Eastern theatre early on 26 January 1991. [...] In theatre, it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carried a single laser designator pod, and acted as backup to {{the other in the}} event of an <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction.</b> [...] The first combat mission took place on 2 February, operating at a medium altitude of roughly , and successfully attacked the As Suwaira Road Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{made his}} next start on August 16 at the Brighton Beach {{racetrack}} in New York City, {{known as a}} gambling hotbed. Dan Patch was the heavy favorite to win the race, but his odds to win the first heat drifted up from 3/5 to 5/4, attracting a [...] "mad scramble" [...] from bettors looking {{to cash in on}} the generous odds. The start of the first heat was delayed by over an hour due to an <b>equipment</b> <b>malfunction.</b> When the race finally began, Dan Patch went to the early lead but was then eased back. In the homestretch, he was given [...] "modest" [...] encouragement but failed to close enough ground, finishing fourth. Bettors were incensed, believing McHenry did not drive to win, possibly after having tipped the bookmakers given the way the odds changed before the race. The time for the heat was 2:09, two seconds slower than Dan Patch's best time to date. McHenry stated that he had held back because he had heard that the winner was fast and he wanted to see how things sorted out.
