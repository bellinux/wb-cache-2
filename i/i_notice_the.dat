[...] A competent doctor could not mistake this condition for malaria or some other tropical fever. [...] <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> article doesn't actually say malaria - - -it says [...] "fever." [...] There are dozens.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't dive after Dickens,' said Ollyett to Bat and {{me by the}} window, 'but {{every time}} I get into a row <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> police-court always fills up with his characters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet you waltz capitally. As a rule, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> men {{who like}} square dances are the sticks who can't waltz without {{upsetting}} one. No, I'm not engaged {{for the next}} Lancers. Yes, with pleasure." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> {{twinkle in}} his eyes. He was {{laughing}} at me.|$|R

6000|$|A woman cannot ever {{be sure of}} {{not being}} married till she is buried, Mrs. Doctor, dear, and {{meanwhile}} I will make a batch of cherry pies. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> doctor favors 'em, and I DO like cooking {{for a man who}} appreciates his victuals." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, let him who {{is highly}} cultured {{take up a}} stone to throw at the poor, untaught Zulu, which <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> most dissolute and drunken wretch of a white man is often ready to do, {{generally}} because he covets his land, his labour, or whatever else may be his.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Davies agreed, as if {{eager to}} explain. [...] "I'd {{a call in}} Brandon, and wanted to look up some {{customers}} in the outlying settlements. When I got so far, I thought I'd come on and see how this country's opening up. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> boys are doing pretty well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a ticklish thing, anyhow {{you look}} at it," [...] sighed Dorothy. [...] "I'm sorry now that <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> Record in the Great Book." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> {{man with}} the {{overhanging}} eyebrows give a queer sort of start. Charles's glance was fixed upon me. I hardly knew what to answer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> latest {{piece of}} {{poisoning}} ingenuity in Pritchard's case. When {{he had made}} his medical student boarders sick, by poisoning the family food, he then quietly walked out, took an emetic, and made himself sick. This with a view to ask them, in examination on a possible trial, whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the rest?--A question naturally asked for him and answered in the affirmative. From which I get at the fact.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lavvy and Ma,' said Bella, 'I say of Mr and Mrs Boffin what I {{always have}} said; and I always shall say of them what I always have said. But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to-night. I {{hope you are}} not sorry to see me, Ma dear,' kissing her; 'and I hope you are not sorry to see me, Lavvy,' kissing her too; 'and as <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> lettuce Ma mentioned, on the table, I'll make the salad.' ...|$|E
60|$|I hope Howells {{is enjoying}} his {{journey to the}} Pacific. He wrote me that you and Osgood were going, also, but I doubted it, believing he was in liquor when he wrote it. In my opinion, this {{universal}} applause over his book is going to land that man in a Retreat inside of two months. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> papers say mighty fine things about your book, too. You ought {{to try to get}} into the same establishment with Howells. But applause does not affect me--I am always calm--this is because I am used to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{are a dozen}} {{pairs of}} high boots. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> size of your foot, and {{have no doubt that}} you will find some of these to fit you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I can {{understand}} that stage of it," [...] said the manager. [...] "By-the-way, are you still connected with <b>the</b> Abstract? <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> name on your card." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I a Pongo that I should wish to kill {{messengers}} and eat them?" [...] asked Bausi, with sarcasm, {{a speech}} at which <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> Pongo envoys winced a little.|$|R
60|$|Where I was {{stopping}} I saw {{the first}} palpable frost, on my sunrise walk, October 6; all over the yet-green spread a light blue-gray veil, giving a new show to the entire landscape. I had but little time to notice it, for the sun rose cloudless and mellow-warm, and as I returned along the lane it had turn'd to glittering patches of wet. As I walk <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> bursting pods of wild-cotton, (Indian hemp they call it here,) with flossy-silky contents, and dark red-brown seeds--a startled rabbit--I pull {{a handful of the}} balsamic life-ever-lasting and stuff it down in my trowsers-pocket for scent.|$|E
60|$|I am {{standing}} in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish colour under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to which I can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the objects}} of beauty and {{interest}} now beginning to appear quite plentifully in this secluded spot, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> humming-bird, the dragon-fly with its wings of slate-color'd guaze, and many varieties of beautiful and plain butterflies, idly flapping among the plants and wild posies. The mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves, to a tall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high, now studded with knobs of golden blossoms. The milk-weed, (I see a great gorgeous creature of gamboge and black lighting on one as I write,) is in flower, with its delicate red fringe; and there are profuse clusters of a feathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems. I see lots of these and much else in every direction, as I saunter or sit. For the last half hour a bird has persistently kept up a simple, sweet, melodious song, from the bushes. (I have a positive conviction {{that some of these}} birds sing, and others fly and flirt about here for my special benefit.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'None of {{the ladies}} made the smear,' Penelope answered. 'I left Miss Rachel in bed at twelve last night. And <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> door, {{and there was nothing}} wrong with it then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I turned, and saw my uncle. He was {{disguised}} in {{a costume}} of reddish-brown cloth. [...] "Golf here?" [...] said I, and then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> tricycle. [...] "A vagrom man on wheels!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just look there!" [...] cried Andy, {{pointing}} out. [...] "Before {{it began}} to rain <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> automobiles on yonder road kicking up quite a dust. Now {{just look at the}} water and mud." ...|$|R
6000|$|On the {{following}} day the Government gave a dinner, to which all those who had done good service during the late hostilities were invited, the British Resident being apparently the only Englishman asked. Amongst the other celebrities present <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> name of Buskes. This man, who is an educated Hollander, was the moving spirit of the Potchefstroom atrocities; indeed, so dark is his reputation that the Royal Commission refused to transact business with him, or to admit him into their presence. Mr. Hudson was not so particular. And now comes the most extraordinary part of the episode. At the dinner it was necessary that the health of Her Majesty as Suzerain should be proposed, and with studied insolence this was done last of all the leading political toasts, and immediately after that of the Triumvirate. Notwithstanding this fact, and that the toast was couched by Mr. Joubert, who stated that [...] "he would not attempt to explain what a Suzerain was," [...] in {{what appear to be}} semi-ironical terms, we find that Mr. Hudson [...] "begged to tender his thanks to the Honourable Mr. Joubert for the kind way in which he proposed the toast." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{people are}} {{exceedingly}} kind and considerate, {{and desire to}} be most hospitable besides. But I cannot accept hospitality, and never go out, except at Boston, or I should not be fit for the labour. If Dolby holds out well to the last {{it will be a}} triumph, for he has to see everybody, drink with everybody, sell all the tickets, take all the blame, and go beforehand to all the places on the list. I shall not see him after to-night for ten days or a fortnight, and he will be perpetually on the road during the interval. When he leaves me, Osgood, a partner in Ticknor and Fields' publishing firm, mounts guard over me, and has to go into the hall from the platform door every night, and see how the public are seating themselves. It is very odd to see how hard he finds it to look a couple of thousand people in the face, on which head, by-the-bye, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> papers to take [...] "Mr. Dickens's extraordinary composure" [...] (their great phrase) rather ill, and on the whole to imply that it would be taken as a suitable compliment if I would stagger on to the platform and instantly drop, overpowered by the spectacle before me.|$|E
60|$|In {{the matter}} of pictures, <b>I</b> <b>notice,</b> <b>the</b> {{correlation}} has even gone a step farther. Not only do we usually take in the episodes of a painting from left to right, but the painter definitely and deliberately intends us so to take them in. For wherever two or three distinct episodes in succession are represented on a single plane in the same picture--as happens often in early art--they are invariably represented in the precise order of the words on a written or printed page, beginning at the upper left-hand corner, and ending at the lower right-hand angle. I first noticed this curious extension of the common principle in the mediæval frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa; and I have since verified it by observations on many other pictures elsewhere, both ancient and modern. The Campo Santo, however, forms an exceptionally good museum of such story-telling frescoes by various painters, as almost every picture consists of several successive episodes. The famous Benozzo Gozzoli, for example, of Noah's Vineyard represents on a single plane all the stages in that earliest drama of intoxication, from the first act of gathering the grapes on the top left, to the scandalised lady, the vergognosa di Pisa, who covers {{her face with her}} hands in shocked horror at the patriarch's disgrace in the lower right-hand corner.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} {{distinguish}} now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague {{outline of a}} hunched-up figure. Then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> opening of the place was darkened by two more black heads. My hand tightened on my stick.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can say {{something}} more," [...] he rejoined. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> {{change in her}} at dinner, I told you she meant mischief. There is another change to-day, which suggests to my mind that the mischief is done." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “…as I was {{watching}} many Excel users do their work, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> difficulty they had moving around large spreadsheets. Finding and jumping to different sections was often difficult. I {{had the idea}} that perhaps a richer input device would help.” ...|$|R
60|$|Slowly we {{float over}} the dark water--not a river, as I had at first supposed, but a lake--until {{we reach the}} shores of a little island; a flat, lonely, barren patch of ground. I am carried along a rough pathway made of great flat stones, until we reach the firmer earth, and {{discover}} a human dwelling-place at last. It is a long, low house of one story high; forming (as well as I can see) three sides of a square. The door stands hospitably open. The hall within is bare and cold and dreary. The men open an inner door, and we enter a long corridor, comfortably warmed by a peat fire. On one wall <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> closed oaken doors of rooms; on the other, rows on rows of well-filled book-shelves meet my eye. Advancing {{to the end of}} the first passage, we turn at right angles into a second. Here a door is opened at last: I find myself in a spacious room, completely and tastefully furnished, having two beds in it, and a large fire burning in the grate. The change to this warm and cheerful place of shelter from the chilly and misty solitude of the moor is so luxuriously delightful that I am quite content, for the first few minutes, to stretch myself on a bed, in lazy enjoyment of my new position; without caring to inquire into whose house we have intruded; without even wondering at the strange absence of master, mistress, or member of the family to welcome our arrival under their hospitable roof.|$|E
6000|$|I had the {{pleasure}} one day to meet on the horse-car an advocate {{of one of the}} great reforms of the day. He held a green bag upon his knees, and without any notice passed from a question of crops to a discussion of suffrage for the negro, and so to womanhood suffrage. [...] "Let the women vote," [...] said he,--"let 'em vote if they want to. I don't care. Fact is, I should like to see 'em do it the first time. They're excitable, you know; they're excitable;" [...] and he enforced his analysis of female character by thrusting his elbow sharply into my side. [...] "Now, there's my wife; I'd like to see her vote. Be fun, I tell you. And the girls,--Lord, the girls! Circus wouldn't be anywhere." [...] Enchanted with the picture which he appeared to have conjured up for himself, he laughed with the utmost relish, and then patting the green bag in his lap, which plainly contained a violin, [...] "You see," [...] he went on, [...] "I go out playing for dancing-parties. Work all day at my trade,--I'm a carpenter,--and play in the evening. Take my little old ten dollars a night. And <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> women a good deal; and I tell you they're all excitable, and I sh'd like to see 'em vote. Vote right and vote often,--that's the ticket, eh?" [...] This friend of womanhood suffrage--whose attitude of curiosity and expectation seemed to me representative of that of a great many thinkers on the subject--no doubt was otherwise a reformer, and held that the coming man would not drink wine--if he could find whiskey. At least I should have said so, guessing from the odors he breathed along with his liberal sentiments.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have noticed}} one very amusing {{way in which}} this is done. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> method applied to about six of the wealthiest men in England in a book of {{interviews}} published by an able and well-known journalist. The flatterer contrives to combine strict truth of fact with a vast atmosphere of awe and mystery by the simple operation of dealing almost entirely in negatives. Suppose you are writing a sympathetic study of Mr. Pierpont Morgan. Perhaps {{there is not much}} to say about what he does think, or like, or admire; but you can suggest whole vistas of his taste and philosophy by talking a great deal about what he does not think, or like, or admire. You say of him--"But little attracted to the most recent schools of German philosophy, he stands almost as resolutely aloof from the tendencies of transcendental Pantheism as from the narrower ecstasies of Neo-Catholicism." [...] Or suppose I am called upon to praise the charwoman who has just come into my house, and who certainly deserves it much more. I say--"It {{would be a mistake to}} class Mrs. Higgs among the followers of Loisy; her position is in many ways different; nor is she wholly to be identified with the concrete Hebraism of Harnack." [...] It is a splendid method, as it gives the flatterer an opportunity of talking about something else besides the subject of the flattery, and it gives the subject of the flattery a rich, if somewhat bewildered, mental glow, as of one who has somehow gone through agonies of philosophical choice of which he was previously unaware. It is a splendid method; but I wish it were applied sometimes to charwomen rather than only to millionaires.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} be quite safe with him," [...] said his wife, in her caressing Highland speech. When she shook hands at parting <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> {{hardness}} of the little palm;—and I have always hated an old, black alpaca dress.|$|R
60|$|I teach! I said no more, for <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> {{hand that}} was {{fluttering}} over the keys, and I {{knew that it}} was not I who ought to speak, that it was she who had something to say to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it is no}} matter, lad; it {{was merely}} that <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> discrepancy. It is several days, and you cannot be {{expected}} to remember precisely. One is apt to be inexact {{when there is no}} particular circumstance to impress the count upon the memory." ...|$|R
