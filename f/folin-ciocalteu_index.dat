40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{influence}} of some pre-fermentative treatments on the volatile content, the chromatic parameters, the total polyphenol index and <b>Folin-Ciocâlteu</b> <b>index</b> of experimental wines obtained from Fetească albă grape variety. Five experimental samples were produced: FA V 0 (control sample), FA V 1 (sodium bentonite treatment), FA V 2 (glutathione treatment), FA V 3 (tannin treatment), FA V 4 (oenological coal treatment). The use of pre-fermentative treatments show lower values of <b>Folin-Ciocâlteu</b> <b>index</b> and total polyphenol index, excepting sample treated with tannin. Major color differences {{are found in the}} sample treated with tannin and oenological coal. Gas-chromatographic analysis reveals the presence of common wine esters, such as: hexanoic acid ethyl ester, ethyl caprylate, ethyl lactate, ethyl caprate, ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, that contributes at the accomplishment of the wines from the sensorial point of view. Diethyl malonate, a compound that occurs naturally in grapes has an apple-like odor and it was identified in the control sample and in the samples treated with tannin and oenological coal, being found n greater quantity in the control sample (0. 02 mmol/L) and the sample treated with coal (0. 03 mmol/L). Another ester, methyl oleate that offers a mild-fatty odor wasn't identified in the control sample, but it was detected in the samples treated with clay, tannin and oenological coal. Using the HPLC method it was also analysed the presence of some organic acids in wine samples...|$|E
40|$|In this study, red {{wines from}} {{different}} grape varieties (Merlot, Aglianico and Piedirosso) and containing different alcoholic level (from 13. 67 to 15. 46 % v/v) {{were treated to}} diminish the alcoholic percentage of 2, 3 and 5 % v/v by a polypropylene hollow fibre membrane contactor apparatus. The wines were analysed before and after partial dealcoholisation. Colour indexes and phenolics were analysed by spectrophotometric methods and HPLC. Wine astringency was evaluated by an astringency index based {{on the ability of}} treated wines to precipitate salivary proteins (SPI, Saliva Precipitation Index). For all the levels of dealcoholisation studied, changes in chromatic characteristics, <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>index</b> and vanillin reactive flavans were below the methodological errors of the analyses. A loss of malvidin 3 -monoglucoside was detected after the dealcoholisation process. Decreasing the ethanol content of wines caused an increase in SPI values...|$|E
40|$|Physico-chemical {{traits of}} three {{eggplant}} genotypes ("Tunisina", "Buia" and "L 305 ") were evaluated {{before and after}} two cooking treatments (grilling and boiling). Different genotypes revealed different changes after cooking, with "Tunisina" showing a better retention of phytochemicals with respect to other two genotypes. The main physical phenomena were water loss during grilling, and dry matter loss after boiling. Chlorogenic acid, the main phenolic in eggplant, resulted higher in grilled samples, while delphinidin glycosides resulted more retained in boiled samples. Glycoalkaloids, thiols and biogenic amines were generally stable, while 5 -hydroxy-methyl-furfural was found only in grilled samples. Interestingly, <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>index</b> and free radical scavenging capacity, measured with three different assays, were generally increased after cooking, with a greater formation of antioxidant substances in grilled samples. NMR relaxation experiments clarified the hypothesis about the changes of eggplant compounds in terms of decomposition of larger molecules and production of small ones after cooking...|$|E
40|$|Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) {{is used as}} an herbal {{medicinal}} product, {{with the}} most typical form of application as infusion with boiling water (sage tea). The well-established traditional uses include symptomatic treatment of mild dyspeptic complaints, the treatment of inflammations in the mouth and the throat, and relief of excessive sweating and relief of minor skin inflammations. In this study, sage teas prepared from commercially available products were chemically analysed for polyphenolic content using liquid chromatography, for antioxidant potential using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method, and for the <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> (FC) <b>index.</b> The sage teas showed a high variation for all parameters studied (up to 20 -fold differences for rosmarinic acid). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the antioxidant potential, which varied between 0. 4 and 1. 8 mmol trolox equivalents/ 100 mL, was highly dependent on rosmarinic acid and its derivatives. The FC index also showed a high correlation to these polyphenols, and could therefore {{be used as a}} screening parameter for sage tea quality. The considerable differences in polyphenolic composition and antioxidant capacity between the brands lead to a demand for quality standardisation, especially if these sage teas are to be used for therapeutic purposes. Further research also appears to be necessary to characterise the dose-benefit relationship, as sage may also contain a constituent (thujone) with potentially adverse effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} that utilizes 1 H-NMR spectroscopy {{has been}} developed to simultaneously analyze toxic terpenes (thujone and camphor), major polyphenolic compounds, the total antioxidant capacity (ORAC) and the <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> (FC) <b>index</b> in foods and medicines containing sage. The quantitative determination of rosmarinic acid (limit of detection (LOD) = 10 mg/L) and total thujone (LOD = 0. 35 mg/L) was possible using direct integration of the signals. For other parameters (derivatives of rosmarinic acid, carnosol and flavone glycosides, ORAC and FC index), chemometric regression models obtained separately for alcohol-based tinctures (R 2 = 0. 94 – 0. 98) and aqueous tea infusions (R 2 = 0. 79 – 0. 99) were suitable for screening analysis. The relative standard deviations for authentic samples were below 10 %. The developed methodology was applied {{for the analysis of}} a wide variety of sage products (n = 108). The total thujone content in aqueous tea infusions was found to be in the range of not detectable (nd) to 37. 5 mg/L (average 9. 2 mg/L), while tinctures contained higher levels (range nd— 409 mg/L, average 107 mg/L). The camphor content varied from 2. 1 to 43. 7 mg/L in aqueous infusions and from not detectable to 748 mg/L in tinctures (averages were 14. 1 and 206 mg/L, respectively). Phenolic compounds were also detected in the majority of the investigated products. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy was proven to have the ability to holistically control all important adverse and beneficial compounds in sage products in a single experiment, considerably saving time, resources and costs as NMR replaces four separate methodologies that were previously needed to analyze the same parameters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{being evaluated}} uses voltammetric sensors combined in an electronic tongue {{to observe the}} antioxidant capacity in red wines. These Electronic Tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants. As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a reference electrode (Silver/Silver Chloride electrode). [...] Furthermore, a platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the Graphite-Epoxy Composite (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals were complex and needed an additional extraction stage. [...] It {{was found that the}} ET method could successfully analyze wine’s antioxidant capacity as it agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, <b>Folin-Ciocalteu,</b> and I280 <b>indexes.</b> [...] Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample {{did not have to be}} pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminshed the popularity of traditional methods. [...] Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the astringency of red wines {{by means of a}} SDS-PAGE based-method. The optimization of the in vitro assay, named SPI (Saliva Precipitation Index) that measured the reactivity of salivary proteins towards wine polyphenols, has been performed. Improvements included the choice of saliva:wine ratio, saliva typology (resting or stimulated saliva), and temperature of binding. The LOD (0. 05 g/L of condensed tannin) and LOQ (0. 1 g/L of condensed tannin) for the binding reaction between salivary proteins and tannins added in white wine were also determined. Fifty-seven red wines were analysed by the optimised SPI, the <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>Index,</b> the gelatine index, the content of total tannins and the sensory quantitative evaluation of astringency. A significant correlation between the SPI and the astringency of red wines was found (R 2 = 0. 969), thus indicating that this assay may be useful as estimator of astringency...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – In this study, {{we carried}} out the analyse of some polyphenolic {{fractions}} obtained from a sample of red wine by solid-liquid repartition. The wine selected sample was obtained by mixing noble wine varieties, {{with the purpose of}} realising a great concentration of phenolic compounds. The fractions obtained from this special sample were firstly chemically analysed (total quantity of polyphenols, total quantity of anthocyans, <b>Folin-Ciocâlteu</b> <b>index</b> and permanganate index), and then were correlated with their specific effects on the intensity of oxygen respiratory consumption of the batracian muscle and hepatic cells, carried out by the Warburg micromanometrical method. Different biological effects (values of oxygen cellular consumption) were recorded, according to the type of cells, composition of fractions (polyphenol quantity) and duration of records. The obtained results evidenced a specific influence of the studied fractions on the respiratory and energetic cellular processes, indicating a series of useful pharmacological properties of some wine fractions.

40|$|Treixadura {{wines from}} the 1998 vintage were {{obtained}} from traditional vinification in a winery. After alcoholic fermentation, the wine was subjected to ageing in oak barrels for three months. One part of the wine is placed in barrels of American oak and the other part in French oak (Allier oak). Wine stored simultaneously in a stainless steel tank {{was used as a}} control. Chemical composition and volatile compounds of wines were analysed. There were no appreciable differences in alcohol and tartaric acid among the wines stored under different conditions, but differences were observed in pH, total and volatile acidity, reducing sugars, malic and lactic acids. Ageing in oak barrels resulted in an increase in volatile acidity and <b>Folin–Ciocalteu</b> <b>index,</b> and a decrease of free and total sulphur dioxide. Various monoterpenes, norisoprenoids, hexenols, sulphurs, volatile phenols, acetals and lactones increase their content notably when aged in barrels of both American and French oak. On the other hand, some acetates, ethyl esters and fatty acids were present in higher concentrations in the wine stored in stainless steel tank. Sensory results indicated that the wine aged in French (Allier) oak was better scored than when aged in American oak, as it provided subtle and delicate nuances of wood, which did not mask the fruity aroma of the Treixadura wine but contributed to its aromatic complexity...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a fingerprinting strategy capable to evaluate the “oxidation status” of white wines based on cyclic voltammetry is proposed here. It is known that the levels of specific antioxidants and redox mechanisms may be evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. This electrochemical technique was applied on two sets of samples. One group was composed of normal aged white wines and a second group obtained from a white wine forced aging protocol with different oxygen, SO 2, pH, and temperature regimens. A study of antioxidant additions, namely ascorbic acid, was also made {{in order to establish}} a statistical link between voltammogram fingerprints and chemical antioxidant substances. It was observed that the oxidation curve presented typical features, which enables sample discrimination according to age, oxygen consumption, and antioxidant additions. In fact, it was possible to place the results into four significant orthogonal directions, compressing 99. 8 % of nonrandom features. Attempts were made to make voltammogram fingerprinting a tool for monitoring oxidation management. For this purpose, a supervised multivariate control chart was developed using a control sample as reference. When white wines are plotted onto the chart, it is possible to monitor the oxidation status and to diagnose the effects of oxygen regimes and antioxidant activity. Finally, quantification of substances implicated in the oxidation process as reagents (antioxidants) and products (off-flavors) was tried using a supervised algorithmic the partial least square regression analysis. Good correlations (r > 0. 93) were observed for ascorbic acid, <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>index,</b> total SO 2, methional, and phenylacetaldehyde. These results show that cyclic voltammetry fingerprinting can be used to monitor and diagnose the effects of wine oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the influence of the maceration techniques on the volatile and phenolic compounds content of the wines obtained from an autochthonous aromatic variety from Romania. For this study, a pink biotype of the Busuioacă de Bohotin variety from the Huşi vineyard was used. The wine samples were obtained by applying five types of maceration: Classic maceration (V 1; S 1), Thermo-maceration (V 2; S 2), Microwave maceration (V 3; S 3), Ultrasound maceration (V 4; S 4) and Cryo-maceration (V 5; S 5). The results of the aromatic profile of the wine samples obtained from Busuioacă de Bohotin variety, indicated that the wine samples obtained through cryo-maceration and classic maceration contained a large variety of volatile compounds, namely: alcohols (1 -propanol; 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol, phenethyl alcohol e. g.), esters (ethyl octanoate; ethyl caprylate; ethyl lactate; ethyl benzoate; ethyl palmitate e. g.) terpenoid compounds (α-terpineol, linalool, hotrienol, citronellol, nerol, geraniol) and so an. Among alcohols, phenethyl alcohol, which is responsible for floral aroma of roses and is typical for the Busuioacă de Bohotin wine, was found in large quantities in wine samples V 1 (4. 3 [*]mmol/L) and S 5 (5. 53 [*]mmol/L). Terpene compounds and their oxides were identified with elevated levels for linalool (cis- and trans-) and also nerol- as well as linalool-oxide. Analysing the phenolic compounds, it was observed that the total polyphenol index and <b>Folin-Ciocâlteu</b> <b>index</b> expressed higher values for the wine samples V 1 and V 3. Concerning the total anthocyanins and tannins content, the wine samples obtained had low amounts of this compounds...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was lo perform a {{specific}} selection of yeasts for red winemaking. Using a phenotypic-based methodology 99 slrains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ablelo easily sporify, low H 2 S-producing, low acetic acid-producing, noi toam producingand exhibiting high fermenlalion power during red winemaking have been selecledfrom a major yeast collection. In a second slep, a Petri plate evaluation of wine colouradsorplion phenolype of yeasls and the result confirmation by microvinificalion trialswere carried out. Strains were split based on Iheir ability to adsorb phenolic grapepigments lo identify a maximum of ten strains, the lowest adsorbing ones. The 99 strains of S. cerevisiae were isolated from Spanish, Portuguese and Sicilian mustsand wines and are included in the Department of "Scienze Agrarie e degli Alimenti"collection. The yeasts were studied in Petri plates for the following biochemicalcharacteristics: spore production on acetate agar at 25 °C for 10 d, H 2 S production onBiGGY agar at 25 °C for 48 h, aceti c acid production on calcium carbonate agar at 25 °C far 7 d, adsorption of grape pigments on grape skin agar al 28 °C far 10 d (Caridiet al., 2002; 2007). The microvinification Irials were performed using Calabrian blackgrapes from Ihe cultivar Gaglioppo; Ihe grapes were destemmed, crushed andsoaked at O°C for 3 days, performing a punch down Iwice per day.

40|$|Se ha estudiado la influencia de los residuos de fungicidas (metrafenona, mezcla boscalid+kresoxim-metil) aplicados en campo bajo condiciones de buenas y críticas prácticas agrícolas (BPA y CPA) y añadidos en bodega antes de la vinificación (ciafozamida, fenhexamida y mepanipirim), en la actividad antioxidante, compuestos fenólicos y su biodisponibilidad en vinos Tempranillo y Graciano (DO Rioja), durante las vendimias 2012, 2013 y 2014. En primer lugar se ha validado la metodología analítica para la determinación de los fungicidas en uva y vino, mediante extracción multirresiduos QuEChERS con acetonitrilo y análisis por HPLC-MS/MS (triple cuadrupolo). Alcanzando un límite de cuantificación de 0, 01 ppm, una linealidad de respuesta (R 2 > 0, 998) y exactitud (70 - 110 %) y precisión con SD 0, 998) and an {{accuracy}} (70 - 110 %) and precision with SD< 20 %. In the wines made from grapes {{treated in the}} field under GAP, the LMR established for grapes were not surpassed. In the Tempranillo varieties under CPA treatments, kresoxim-metyl and metrafenone slightly exceeded the el LMR (1. 48 and 0. 84 versus 1 and 0. 5 ppm, respectively). In the wines fortified in the winery with fenhexamid, mepanipyrim and cyazofamid, the LMR were not exceeded. The presence of fungicide residues in the Tempranillo wines had no significant effect on their antioxidant activity. In the Graciano wines, boscalid+kresoxim-methyl and metrafenone presented significant differences in their antioxidant capacity. Residues of boscalid+kresoxim-methyl, fenhexamid and cyazofamid reduce the total polyphenols (<b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>index)</b> in Tempranillo. In contrast, metrafenone slightly increases it in Graciano. The most notable phenolic fraction in Tempranillo and Graciano is the antocianos (70. 45 and 77. 50 % respectively), followed by the hidroxicinnamic derivatives (18. 31 and 13. 64 %) and flavonols (14. 62 and 9. 95 %). The stilbenes in Graciano wines show slightly higher percentages than in Tempranillo (6. 34 versus 4. 98 %). The in vitro bioavailability of the fungicides in Graciano wine shows a positive matrix effect with respect to Tempranillo. Dialysis percentages range from 6. 1 % for kresoxim-metil in Tempranillo to 36. 6 % for boscalid in Graciano. Mepanipyrim in Tempranillo and boscalid in Graciano present the greatest bioavailability. It is confirmed that the clarification has a slight positive effect on bioavailability. In wines made from grapes treated under CPA, the dialyzation percentages of boscalid and kresoxim-methyl stood between 21 and 31 %, while metrafenone did not present dialyzation. No dialyzation occurred for cyazofamid added to the must. It {{has been shown that}} fungicide residues affect the bioavailability of both the phenolic fraction and the antioxidant activity, but no clear differences were found in the dialyzation of the phenolic fraction for either wine. The stilbenes were the phenolic compounds that showed the highest percentage of dialyzation (50 %). The total polyphenol content after the in vitro digestion of wine fell on average by 10 % with respect to the initial content in Tempranillo treated in the field and by more than 18 % in the case of cyazofamid added prior to vinification. The results were similar for Graciano, except in the treatments with the boscalid and kresoxim-methyl mix, where the bioavailability of the polyphenols increased by up to 25 %. The presence of the fungicides studied affects the bioavailability of the antioxidant activity of the Tempranillo wines, but not that of the Graciano ones. Finally, it has been shown that, in general, for all the pesticides studied the in vitro bioavailability does not exceed 37 % dialyzation with respect to the initial concentration present in the wine, which indicates a clear safety margin in toxicological terms...|$|E
