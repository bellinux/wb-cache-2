60|$|He {{had given}} me my cue. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} and spoke sorrowfully.|$|E
60|$|How could I resist that? <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers. [...] "Don't quit, Nan. You'll {{never forgive}} {{yourself}} if you quit. Take it from me, Whit will pull out of this hole!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at 'im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>my</b> sword, but Checco caught {{hold of my}} arm. I {{recovered}} {{myself at}} once.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>’and</b> in <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at ’im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I could swear to that. And {{now we must}} act together. When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> him, you do the same, and give him no chance to use his sword or pistols." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{leave you}} {{at the door of}} these places. I am too well known to enter. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the {{shoulder}} of too many men, during the year, for me to go into any society without the risk of someone knowing me again." ...|$|E
60|$|He gave such a {{start when}} <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> upon his shoulder, {{that he made}} me start too.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{upon the}} door-knob, I heard steps upon the stairs, {{and looking up}} saw Duncan Woodward descending.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in <b>my</b> pocket and drew out the empty envelope.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm again, {{and this}} time he was less alarmed. [...] "We seem to have a sort of {{invisible}} bodies," [...] said he. [...] "By Jove! there's a boat coming round the headland. It's very much like the old life after all--in a different climate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, darling, I {{remember}} exactly how I kissed you that first time,' said Springrove. 'You were there {{as you are}} now. I unshipped the sculls in this way. Then I turned round and sat beside you--in this way. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side of}} your little neck--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blast you," [...] I said, [...] "this {{is not a}} fantaisie. Do {{you take}} me for a dragon-fly, or what? Now come, let's get this fantaisie {{business}} cleared up. This is what I want"--and here <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a roll of very quiet grey cloth on the counter.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> in <b>my</b> pocket. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it in {{the other}} one, and arter that I stood staring at George Tebb and shaking all over.|$|R
6000|$|I {{took a deep}} breath. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the sides}} of my mouth. [...] "Cavor!" [...] I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin {{shouting}} far away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha-nor do I. If I did I should {{soon find}} my mistake out. If <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{out to take}} anything, <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> is very soon bitten, I can tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{wonderful}} what a change this mere spark of hope wrought in us. In {{a moment we}} were all three groping about on our hands and knees, feeling for the slightest indication of a draught. Presently my ardour received a check. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> something cold. It was dead Foulata's face.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, and I {{guess that}} my voice trembled a trifle as, while reproving {{him for his}} act, I made it plain to him that my {{gratitude}} was no less potent a force than his loyalty to me. Then it was that I outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines, and to take my ship back to New York myself.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} he sat silently, {{his hand on the}} blind. He was so {{different}} from the Hendry I had known, that I felt myself {{in the presence of a}} strange man. His eyes were glazed with staring at the turn of the brae where the doctor must first come into sight. His breathing became heavier, till it was a gasp. Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, and he stared at me.|$|E
60|$|Her ear! The dear little ear which I had kissed so often. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to each little velvet shell to {{make certain}} that this sacrilege had not yet been committed.|$|R
60|$|And then revulsion took me, {{suddenly}} {{and without any}} cause or warning. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>my</b> face to shut out a vision whose true significance I realized as in a flash.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{had reached}} the lodge, where I had left my bicycle, I met Brownster, and when I saw him <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>my</b> pocket. He had {{certainly}} been very attentive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard!" [...] I cried out, rising hastily. [...] "I {{will not}} {{hear you say}} such shameful words!" [...] I was very angry with him indeed, {{for the first time}} in my life, but it only lasted a moment. When I saw his worn young face looking at me as if he were sorry, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulder}} and said, [...] "If you please, my dear Richard, do not speak in such a tone to me. Consider!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hitherto we had met no Bedouins, and I interrogated my {{dragoman}} {{about them}} more than once; but he always {{told me that it}} did not signify; we should meet them, he said, before any danger could arise. [...] "As for danger," [...] said I, [...] "I think more of this than I do of the Arabs," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my revolver. [...] "But as they agreed to be here, here they ought to be. Don't you carry a revolver, Smith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I {{took one}} slow {{step at a}} time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they {{followed}} a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, [...] "There, that's enough--put your head in." [...] I done it, but I judged they would take it off.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> {{under his}} shirt and felt. The skin was {{stretched}} like parchment over the bones, and the sensation produced was {{for all the world}} like running one's hand over a washboard.|$|R
5000|$|Mikhail Gorbachev and {{his wife}} were on the train {{returning}} to Russia following a state visit to East Germany. After they'd been travelling a short while, his wife asked him: [...] "Where are we now, Mikhail dear?" [...] He put his hand out of the window and said: [...] "We're still in Germany, dear." [...] Several hours later, his wife asked him again: [...] "Where are we now?" [...] He put his hand out of the window and replied: [...] "In Poland." [...] Some time later, his wife asked again: [...] "Where are we now?" [...] Gorbachev put his hand out of the window and said: [...] "We're back in Russia." [...] His wife was curious; she asked: [...] "How do you know where we are just by putting your hand out of the window?" [...] He replied: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> out in Germany, the people kissed it. When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> out in Poland, they spat on it. And when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> out in Russia, they stole my watch." ...|$|R
60|$|The boarder was {{standing}} in the middle of the dining-room, into which the stairs led. I could not see him, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> against him as I was feeling my way across the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{supposed}} so, Roland. But when I {{went away}} I {{never thought of}} leaving the keys behind me, and found them days afterwards {{in the pocket of}} my overcoat. Unless they have changed the fastenings, there is nothing to prevent my unlocking the door, going up to my old room, entering it, and opening the safe as usual. There would be no occasion even for a light, for I know the feel of the book so well, with its locked clasp, that I could tell it in the dark if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knelt down}} just within {{the edge of}} woods, whither I had seen the last laggard of the brood vanish like a brown streak, and began {{to look for them}} carefully. After a time I found one. He was {{crouched}} flat on a dead oak leaf, just under my nose, his color hiding him wonderfully. Something glistened in a tangle of dark roots. It was an eye, and presently I could make out a little head there. That was all I could find of the family, though a dozen more were close beside me, under the leaves mostly. As I backed away <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> another before seeing him, and barely saved myself from hurting the little sly-boots, who never stirred a muscle, not even when I took away the leaf that covered him and put it back again softly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked what}} was the matter with her. She complained of faintness and depression, and said she felt sick. I inquired if she had taken {{anything}} in the way of physic or food while I had been asleep. She answered that her husband had come in about an hour since, and, finding her still sleepless, had himself administered the composing draught. Mr. Macallan (sleeping in the next room) joined us while she was speaking. He too had been aroused by the bell. He heard what Mrs. Macallan said to me about the composing draught, and made no remark upon it. It seemed to me that he was alarmed at his wife's faintness. I suggested that she should take a little wine, or brandy and water. She answered that she could swallow nothing so strong as wine or brandy, having a burning pain in her stomach already. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her stomach--quite lightly. She screamed when I touched her.|$|E
6000|$|I, IN {{the sour}} black tomb, trodden to {{absolute}} death <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in the night, one night, and <b>my</b> [...] <b>hand</b> touched {{that which was}} verily not me verily it was not me. Where I had been was a sudden blaze a sudden flaring blaze! So <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> out further, a little further and I felt that which was not I, it verily was not I it was the unknown.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>my</b> pocket. [...] "One pound seventeen," [...] I answered, {{counting}} it. [...] "It {{will pay}} my fare to London--or {{buy me a}} dinner and a second-hand revolver. I haven't quite decided yet." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, a {{memorial}} plaque to Brown was unveiled in the Writers' Museum, in the Royal Mile, Edinburgh. It is engraved with a quotation from his best-known poem, [...] "Hamnavoe":In {{the fire of}} imagesGladly <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> ...|$|R
