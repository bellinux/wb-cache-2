25|$|Prior to the {{acceptance}} of an employment offer, the prospective employee usually {{has the opportunity to}} negotiate the terms of the offer. This primarily focuses on salary, but extends to benefits, work arrangements, and other amenities as well. Negotiating salary can potentially lead the prospective employee to a higher salary. In fact, a 2009 study of employees indicated that those who negotiated salary saw an average increase of $4,913 from their original salary offer. In addition, the employer is able to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>confident</b> that they have hired an employee with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to deal with conflict. Negotiating salary will thus likely yield an overall positive outcome for both sides of the bargaining table.|$|E

500|$|... "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is {{the most}} {{prominent}} representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The track features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing and ragged, gutsy vocals, which, at several points, feature a gravelly element. It results in an uptempo electronic rock number. Lyrically, [...] "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is a merciless message to an ex-boyfriend. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] mixes R and pop music elements while having instrumentation that includes a [...] "clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as a hook". Cyrus' vocals display an undertone of alternative country twang and features belter refrains. The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] discuss Cyrus' relocation from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. The refrains mainly speak of how her favorite songs make her <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>confident.</b> [...] "When I Look at You" [...] is a power ballad that transitions in instrumentation, from piano to electric guitar. Throughout the song, Cyrus keeps a hushed tone, but starts to belt soon {{before the arrival of}} the second verse. Lyrically, it speaks of a dream lover. [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] is a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background. Cyrus' processed vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune; influences derive from new wave music. The song's lyrics talk about not worrying so much about the future and simply focusing on the present and having a good time together. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] is a pop-punk, garage rock song with disco influences and a number of hooks. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] features lyrics that speak of being extremely irritated after encountering predicaments at a club and others smoking cigarettes.

[...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>confident.</b> She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E

30|$|A {{strength}} is delineated in three elements - performance, energy and use-all of {{which must be}} present in order for strengths to underpin and sustain optimal performance.

This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful.

A study by Burgoyne et al. (2010) reports that male students <b>feel</b> significantly <b>more</b> <b>confident</b> about transferable and research-specific skills when contrasted to female students. Additionally, female students appear to be less interested in research and tend to prefer devoting more time to academia (curricular activities) than to research (extra-curricular activities) (Abu-Zaid and Alnajjar 2014; Abu-Zaid and Altinawi 2014; Salgueira et al. 2012). Logically, the more time and efforts spent in conducting scholarly research activities, the higher the probability to produce scientific publications (Abu-Zaid 2014). Moreover, we also believe that this gender-biased disparity concerning the number of student-authored publications by males and females may be {{because of the fact}} that Alfaisal University—College of Medicine began enrolling male students in Fall 2008 and female students in Fall 2011. Therefore, male students have had the advantage of three surplus years to produce publications.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} aspects of participation in a participatory action research project, the Ashgrove Healthy School Environment Project. Participatory action research is a form of research that creates change as an explicit part of the research process and requires the active participation of those by and for whom the research is being conducted. This study arose from concems by this researcher, who is also a co-facilitator of the project, that levels of participation were not as extensive as one might have hoped and that this seemingly low level would have a negative impact on the continuing participation of those already involved. Specifically. this evaluation sought to uncover the reasons that prompted participation, to identify structural barriers to initial involvement and to uncover participants' perceptions of the process, including barriers and opportunities. It also sought to record evidence of any shift in decision making and to draw implications about the findings that could assist the project, the school, other schools and the wider community. This evaluation involved focus group discussions and interviews with participants actively involved in the school project. The purpose was to uncover their views, feelings and perceptions about their participation and the participatory processes in use generally. It also included some examination of school documents and newsletters and as also drawn on the reflections of this 'insider' researcher, based on two years of involvement in facilitating the project. The findings that emerge from this study are heartening. Rather than feeling anxious about the long-term sustainability of the project, this researcher now <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>confident</b> about its achievements, both in terms of the changes that have occurred in the school and about the participatory processes and levels of participation. Whilst the evaluation has identified a number of barriers, both institutional, personal and project related, it has also identified several key factors that serve to promote participation...|$|R
