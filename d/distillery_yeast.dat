Raw <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast</b> sludge was washed with water using water and sludge in the ratio 6 : 1, respectively. Proximate analysis of raw <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast</b> sludge and washed distillery sludge was carried out for crude protein (CP), true protein (TP), ether extract (EE), ash, acid insoluble ash and nitrogen free extract (NFE) determination. Mineral contents and amino acid profile of raw <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast</b> sludge and washed distillery sludge were also determined. After chemical evaluation, four iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous broiler starter and finisher diets were prepared in mash form using 0 (control), 4, 8 and 12 % levels of washed distillery sludge replacing canola meal. One hundred and twenty day-old broiler chicks were randomly distributed into 12 experimental units {{in such a way that}} each diet was offered to three experimental units, each comprising of 10 chicks. It was observed that washing affected the nutrients either by decreasing or increasing their concentration. It decreased the total mineral contents whereas CP, TP, EE and NFE contents increased. Washing also increased amino acid profile. Average feed intake and weight gain were higher in birds fed diet containing 8 % washed distillery sludge and lower in birds fed diet containing 0 % washed distillery sludge. Feed cost per kg live weight gain decreased significantly as the level of washed distillery sludge was increased in the diet. Average heart, liver and pancreas weights decreased with increased level of washed distillery sludge in the diet.

40|$|Abstract: With India’s {{livestock}} population approaching 100 million, {{the demand for}} dry fodder and concentrates {{is more than twice}} the supply and the demand for green fodder is four times the supply mean while 242 MT sugarcane is produced annually with lot of yeast sludge awaiting disposal. Hence, the present investigation was aimed at determining the nutritive content of <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast</b> sludge (DYS) and its use as a value added feed additive. It was fed to white leghorn chicks of one week of age for a period of 45 days at different levels of incorporation (0 %, 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 %). One bird of each treatment died except in the control and the 10 % level. The marginal decline in weight gain was observed with increasing levels of DYS in the diet. At the end of 45 day of experiment, blood was collected from the surviving birds andth biochemically analyzes the Hemoglobin, serum protein, calcium and phosphorus The cost of feed per 100 g live weight gain decreased with the inclusion of DYS in the diet than in the control feed. The results thus indicate that DYS, after washing, can safely be included for growing chick, up to 30 % level with distinct economic advantages.

In contrast to a well-established genome of brewer's and wine yeast strains, the comprehensive evaluation of genomic features of distillery strains is lacking. In the present study, twenty two <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast</b> strains were subjected to electrophoretic karyotyping and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The strains analyzed {{were assigned to the}} Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex and grouped into four species categories: S. bayanus, S. paradoxus, S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii. The genomic diversity was mainly revealed within subtelomeric regions and the losses and/or gains of fragments of chromosomes I, III, VI and IX were the most frequently observed. Statistically significant differences in the gene copy number were documented in six functional gene categories: 1) telomere maintenance via recombination, DNA helicase activity or DNA binding, 2) maltose metabolism process, glucose transmembrane transporter activity; 3) asparagine catabolism, cellular response to nitrogen starvation, localized in cell wall-bounded periplasmic space, 4) siderophore transport, 5) response to copper ion, cadmium ion binding and 6) L-iditol 2 - dehydrogenase activity. The losses of YRF 1 genes (Y' element ATP-dependent helicase) were accompanied by decreased level of Y' sequences and an increase in DNA double and single strand breaks, and oxidative DNA damage in the S. paradoxus group compared to the S. bayanus group.

40|$|That {{microorganisms}} {{grown in}} culture will eventually cease growth and sometimes die {{is known to}} all who have carried on pure culture work. Cessation of growth {{may be due to}} one of three factors: (1) depletion of nutrients, (2) unfavorable environ-mental conditions, or (3) the so-called "staling effect " which is due to the accumulation of products of the organism's own metab-olism. When cessation of certain physiological activities occurs even when environmental conditions are favorable and there is an ample supply of nutrient materials in the medium, it is evident that this cessation is due to the third of the above-mentioned factors. It is a well-known fact that in the commercial produc-tion of alcohol by fermentation there is a certain alcohol concen-tration which cannot be exceeded, regardless of the amount of sugar supplied to the yeast cell. It is obvious that after a certain period the yeast is no longer able to produce alcohol, and, since fermentation always stops about when the same alcohol concen-tration is attained (if the same yeast strain is always used), it is logical to assume that for every strain of yeast there is a maximum alcohol concentration above which the yeast ceases to function. A number of workers have observed that different yeasts will vary in the amount of alcohol they produce (e. g., <b>distillery</b> <b>yeasts</b> and wine yeasts); these differences might possibly be due to differences between the yeasts in their abilities to tolerate alcohol. Of course, during the alcoholic fermentation many substances other than alcohol are formed, but ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide ar...|$|R

MÉTODOS: O autolisado foi obtido pela lavagem e autólise da biomassa. A secagem foi realizada em secador de bandeja na temperatura de 70 ºC. Realizaram-se as seguintes análises: caracterização físico-química (teor lipídico, proteico, fibras totais, fibras solúveis e insolúveis, e cinzas); composição de aminoácidos; análises microbiológicas do produto desidratado; e avaliação sensorial do pão de queijo contendo o autolisado desidratado, através de escala hedônica e teste de atitude. RESULTADOS: O autolisado desidratado apresentou: 1, 2 % de lipídeos; 24, 7 % de proteínas; 51, 3 % de fibras totais, sendo 2, 4 % de fibras solúveis e 48, 9 % de insolúveis; e 6, 2 % de cinzas. As análises microbiológicas mostraram-se dentro do limite recomendado pela Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária. O perfil aminoacídico mostrou deficiência de histidina e metionina+cistina. A análise sensorial do pão de queijo mostrou boa aceitação, tendo apenas cor e aparência recebido notas baixas. A maioria dos participantes disse que "gosta disto e compraria de vez em quando". CONCLUSÃO: Os valores de proteína e aminoácidos encontrados na levedura de cachaça de alambique foram inferiores ao mostrado na {{literatura}} para levedura de cervejaria e destilaria de álcool etílico. A levedura desidratada estava microbiologicamente apta para consumo humano. A baixa aceitabilidade da aparência do pão de queijo provavelmente ocorreu pelo fato de os consumidores não estarem habituados à cor escura do produto. Trabalhos futuros poderão sugerir adição em outros produtos que apresentem aparência mais atrativa. OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} study the properties of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) autolysate obtained from pot still rum, including centesimal composition, amino acid profile and microbiological analysis, and perform a sensory analysis of cheese buns (also known as Brazilian cheese bread or rolls) enriched with dried autolysate. METHODS: Autolysate was obtained by rinsing and autolyzing the biomass and dried on a tray dryer at 70 º. Its composition was then determined (fat, protein, total fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, ash and amino acid contents) followed by microbiological analysis. Finally, cheese buns enriched with dried autolysate were submitted to sensory analysis using the hedonic scale and attitude test. RESULTS: Dried autolysate contained 1. 2 % fats; 24. 7 % proteins; 51. 3 % total fiber, where 2. 4 % was soluble and 48. 9 % was insoluble; and 6. 2 % ash. According to microbiological analysis, the product complied with the microbiological limits established by the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária. Amino acid profile showed that histidine and methionine-cystine levels were low. Sensory analysis indicated good acceptance of the cheese buns. Only their color and appearance received low scores. Most participants reported liking the cheese buns and willingness to buy them on occasion. CONCLUSION: The protein and amino acid levels found in pot still rum were lower than those {{reported in the literature}} for breweries and ethanol <b>distilleries.</b> Dried <b>yeast</b> was microbiologically suitable for human consumption. The low grades given to the appearance of the cheese buns were probably due to their unappealing dark color, as opposed to the usual pale yellow color.

The diets contained one or several of the following ingredients: sucrose, soy meal, rice meal, sugar-cane-alcohol <b>distillery</b> <b>yeast,</b> wheat meal, soy milk powder, and ground lentils. Sucrose, in the form of sugar syrup, was used as a protein-free control. One of the diets, which included soy milk powder as a major protein source, instead of soy meal, resulted in low haemolymph protein levels, {{similar to that of the}} sucrose diet. All of the other protein diets raised the haemolymph protein levels significantly above that of the newly emerged bees (approximately 20 – 28 versus an initial 14 mg/ml haemolymph). The haemolymph protein levels of bees fed with these pollen substitute diets were similar to those of bees fed on bee bread.
