The finite element schemes have the disadvantage in that the vertical step size {{is determined by the}} desired maximum frequency content, which in turn determines the time step required for stability. This time step is usually many times smaller than the time increment associated with the maximum frequency. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of this {{approach}} is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as anisotropy, non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. Cartesian grid) in conjunction with an explicit time <b>integration</b> <b>scheme</b> (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in radio frequency (RF) applications.|$|E

As an alternative, so-called structure preserving time <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> based on the (generalized) energy momentum method have been proposed in [33 – 36] for isothermal nonlinear elasticity. Later, those methods have been extended to isothermal contact [37], elasto-plasticity [38], thermo-elasticity [39 – 41] and thermo-elastic contact [11]. The combination of the cited works to a structure preserving time integration for a fully coupled thermo-elasto-plastic contact problem {{is beyond the scope}} of this paper, but might be a worthwhile topic of future research.|$|R

40|$|Added-mass {{instability}} {{is known}} to be an important issue in the partitioned approach for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solvers. Despite the implementation of the implicit approach, convergence of solution can be difficult to achieve. Relaxation may be applied to improve this implicitness of the partitioned algorithm, but this commonly leads to a significant increase in computational time. This is because the critical relaxation factor that allows stability of the coupling tends to be impractically small. In this study, a mathematical analysis for optimizing numerical performance based on different time <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> that pertain to both the fluid and solid accelerations is presented. The aim is to determine the most efficient configuration for the FSI architecture. Both theoretical and numerical results suggest that the choice of time <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> has a significant influence on the stability of FSI coupling. This concludes that, in addition to material and its geometric properties, the choice of time <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> is important in determining the stability of the numerical computation. A proper selection of the associated parameters can improve performance considerably by influencing the condition of coupling stability...|$|R

5000|$|While the {{equation}} looks simple, {{there are at}} least three concerns when attempting to solve it numerically. The first is the <b>integration</b> <b>scheme.</b> This is typically a Runge-Kutta, although others can be useful as well, such as a leapfrog. The second is the method of determining the velocity vector, [...] at a given position, , and time, t. Normally, it is not known at all positions and times, therefore some method of interpolation is required. If the velocities are gridded in space and time, then bilinear, trilinear or higher-dimensional linear interpolation is appropriate. Bicubic, tricubic, etc., interpolation is used as well, but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead.|$|E

40|$|From the introduction). The {{different}} <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> in {{the world}} vary in various ways. They vary in functional scope, institutional set-up, size of membership and impact. The different factors used to explain this variance also vary, from economic gains over geopolitics to learning processes and creation of new collective identities. If the <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> {{in different parts of}} the world are so different, are they all sui generis? Does it make sense to compare them? Some scholars have argued that they have enough common traits to be comparable. Most often at least <b>integration</b> <b>schemes</b> try to create freer trade, if not free trade, between the participating states. Many also try to create freer movement for services and capital. One possible way to look at this is to say that they constitute international regimes, i. e. establish principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures around which actors’ expectations converge. (2) A good example of an international regime would be the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), now part of the World Trade Organization (WTO). But, as we shall see, one can argue that at least the European Union (EU) has gone beyond being an international regime, instead becoming a multi-level political system or polity. Although much integration theory has been developed to explain the European case, integration theory has also been used to study integration in other parts of the world, including the Americas. In this paper we shall discuss some theories that may be useful in comparing the EU, NAFTA and Mercosur as well as other <b>integration</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R
