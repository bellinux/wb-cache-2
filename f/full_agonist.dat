5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} <b>full</b> <b>agonist,</b> as it competes with the <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E

25|$|Vabicaserin {{has a high}} {{affinity}} for 5-HT2C receptors and low {{affinity for}} 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors. Vabicaserin is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> with approximately 4-fold greater selectivity for 5-HT2C over these related receptors, in terms of binding affinity. Vabicacserin is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> in stimulating the 5-HT2C receptor; it was discovered when a class of tetrahydroquinoline-fused diazepines were being researched as possible potent 5-HT2C receptor agonists.|$|E
50|$|Partial {{agonists}} of benzodiazepine receptors {{have been}} proposed as a possible alternative to <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> of the benzodiazepine site to overcome the problems of tolerance, dependence and withdrawal which limits the role of benzodiazepines {{in the treatment of}} anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. Such adverse effects appear to be less problematic with bretazenil than <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> Bretazenil, also has been found to have less abuse potential than benzodiazepine <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> such as diazepam and alprazolam, long-term use of bretazenil would still be expected to result in dependence and addiction.|$|R

50|$|Compared to THC, {{which is}} a partial agonist at CB1 receptors, JWH-018, and many {{synthetic}} cannabinoids, are <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> THC {{has been shown to}} inhibit GABA receptor neurotransmission in the brain via several pathways. JWH-018 may cause intense anxiety, agitation, and, in rare cases (generally with non-regular JWH users), has been assumed to have been the cause of seizures and convulsions by inhibiting GABA neurotransmission more effectively than THC. Cannabinoid receptor <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> may present serious dangers to the user when used to excess.|$|R
25|$|Although {{buprenorphine}} is {{a partial}} agonist of the MOR, human {{studies have found}} that it acts like a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> with respect to analgesia. Conversely, buprenorphine behaves like a partial agonist of the MOR with respect to respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|While {{clozapine}} is a muscarinic antagonist at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, clozapine is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> at the M4 subset. Because M4 {{is highly}} {{expressed in the}} salivary gland, its M4 agonist activity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the hypersalivation.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), with low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR). After oxycodone binds to the MOR, a G protein-complex is released, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters by the cell by {{reducing the amount of}} cAMP produced, closing calcium channels, and opening potassium channels.|$|E

40|$|Estrogen {{receptor}} is a transcription regulator and can bind structurally distinct ligands {{with full}} agonistic, SERMs, or full antagonistic properties. Crystal {{structures of the}} ER ligand binding domain (LBD) -complexed with <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> or SERMs show that these ligands induce two different orientations of Helix 12 in LBD and generate two different conformations, agonist conformation (A conformation) and AF 2 antagonist conformation (B conformation). To understand how ER ligands interact with LBD structurally and energetically, we docked 3 <b>full</b> <b>agonists,</b> 9 SERMs and 2 full antagonists in both the A and B conformation of ERα LBD and performed a 4 -step molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on all 28 complexes followed by mm-PBSA binding free energy calculation. We found that all <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> prefer the A conformation while all SERMs prefer the B conformation. Analysis of the mm-PBSA energies revealed that calculated total binding free energies (delta PBTOT) and the difference of VDW between complex and the sum of receptor of ligands and ligand (delta VDW) have the order of full agonists>SERMs>full antagonists. However, the PB surface term has the order of <b>full</b> antagonists>SERMs>full <b>agonists.</b> We {{also found that the}} sum of the RMSD of mainchain atoms of Helix 12 and all atoms of ligands in the A conformation is significantly lower for <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> than that of the other ligands. Together, we conclude that the three types of ER ligands interact with the A and B conformations of ERα LBD differently and same type of ligands interact similarly. These findings will be useful in understanding the mechanism of ER antagonism and can be used in ligand type prediction...|$|R
40|$|PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator {{activated}} receptor γ) is a ligand activated {{transcription factor}} {{of the nuclear}} receptor superfamily that controls {{the expression of a}} variety of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, adipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity. While endogenous ligands of PPARγ include fatty acids and eicosanoids, synthetic <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> of the receptor, including members of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class, have been widely prescribed for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Unfortunately, the use of <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> has been hampered by harsh side effects with some removed from the market in many countries. In contrast, partial agonists of PPARγ have been shown to retain favourable insulin sensitizing effects while exhibiting little to no side effects and thus represent a new potential class of therapeutics for the treatment of T 2 DM. Partial agonists have been found to not only display differences in transcriptional and cellular outcomes, but also act through distinct structural and dynamic mechanisms within the ligand binding cavity compared to <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> Alice J.

25|$|DES {{is a very}} potent <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of the {{estrogen}} receptors (ERs). It has approximately 468% and 295% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERα and ERβ, respectively. However, EC50 {{values of}} 0.18nM and 0.06nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, have been reported, suggesting, {{in spite of its}} binding affinity for the two receptors, several-fold preference for activation of the ERβ over the ERα.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{tianeptine}} {{was found}} to be a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> using human proteins. It was also found to act as a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, although tianeptine produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result in tolerance or withdrawal. The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However anecdotal reports from recreational, non-medical tianeptine users suggest that significant withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged high dose usage. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of tianeptine at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{is in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. Zopiclone, {{although}} molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a <b>full</b> <b>agonist,</b> which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties.|$|E

40|$|Morphine {{is a poor}} inducer of μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) internalization, but {{a potent}} inducer of cellular tolerance. Here we show that, in contrast to <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> such as [D-Ala 2 -MePhe 4 -Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), morphine stimulated a selective phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal residue 375 (Ser 375). Ser 375 phosphorylation was sufficient and required for morphine-induced desensitization of MOR. In the presence of <b>full</b> <b>agonists,</b> morphine revealed partial agonistic properties and potently inhibited MOR phosphorylation and internalization. Upon removal of the drug, DAMGO-desensitized receptors were rapidly dephosphorylated. In contrast, morphine-desensitized receptors remained at the plasma membrane in a Ser 375 -phosphorylated state for prolonged periods. Thus, morphine promotes terminal MOR desensitization by inducing a persistent modification of Ser 375...|$|R
25|$|Zaleplon, like zolpidem, zopiclone, or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has no statistical significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, zaleplon {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics will hopefully arise. Much like zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine and also a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} active {{metabolites}} of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, which, contrary to buprenorphine itself, is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly depresses respiration (10-fold more than buprenorphine). This {{can be explained by}} very poor brain penetration of norbuprenorphine due to a high affinity of the compound for P-glycoprotein. In contrast to norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine and its glucuronide metabolites are negligibly transported by P-glycoprotein.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that buspirone dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that the main effects of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. Buspirone also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E
40|$|INT 131 (formerly T 0903131, T 131, AMG 131) is {{a potent}} non-thiazolidinedione (TZD) {{selective}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ÃŽÂ³ modulator (SPPARM) currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of type- 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). This new chemical entity represents a second generation SPPARM approach developed after the first generation PPARÃŽÂ³ <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> to address their inherent limitations. INT 131 was specifically and carefully designed using preclinical models to exhibit a biological profile of strong efficacy with de minimis side effects compared to PPARÃŽÂ³ <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> As a potent PPARÃŽÂ³ modulator, INT 131 binds to PPARÃŽÂ³ with high affinity.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the biochemical mechanisms of agonist {{action at the}} G protein-coupled D- 2 dopamine receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Stimulation of guanosine 5 '-O-(3 -[S- 35]thio) triphosphate ([S- 35]GTPgammaS) binding by <b>full</b> and partial <b>agonists</b> was determined at different concentrations of [S- 35]GTPgammaS (0. 1 and 10 nM) and {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of GDP. At both concentrations of [S- 35]GTPgammaS, increasing GDP decreased the [S- 35]GTPgammaS binding observed with maximally stimulating concentrations of agonist, with partial agonists exhibiting greater sensitivity to the effects of GDP than <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> The relative efficacy of partial agonists was greater at the lower GDP concentrations. Concentration-response experiments were performed for a range of agonists at the two [S- 35]GTPgammaS concentrations and with different concentrations of GDP. At 0. 1 nM [S- 35]GTPgammaS, the potency of both <b>full</b> and partial <b>agonists</b> was dependent on the GDP concentration in the assays. At 10 nM [S- 35]GTPgammaS, the potency of <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> exhibited a greater dependence on the GDP concentration, whereas the potency of partial agonists was virtually independent of GDP. We concluded that at the lower [S- 35]GTPgammaS concentration, the rate-determining step in G protein activation is the binding of [S- 35]GTPgammaS to the G protein. At the higher [S- 35]GTPgammaS concentration, for <b>full</b> <b>agonists,</b> [S- 35]GTPgammaS binding remains the slowest step, whereas for partial agonists, another (GDP-independent) step, probably ternary complex breakdown, becomes rate-determining...|$|R

25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{pharmacological properties}} of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind {{to the same}} sites on GABAA-containing receptors, causing an enhancement {{of the actions of}} GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to α1, α2, α3, and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist.</b> The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.|$|E
25|$|Unlike anandamide, {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> at the CB1 receptor. At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide. These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon has a {{pharmacological}} profile {{similar to}} benzodiazepines, {{characterized by an}} increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> for the benzodiazepine α1 receptor located on the GABAA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α2 and α3 subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar chemical structure nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects via α2 and α3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α5 subsite), as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.|$|E
5000|$|... 8-OH-DPAT is a {{research}} chemical of the aminotetralin chemical class which {{was developed in the}} 1980s and has been widely used to study the function of the 5-HT1A receptor. It {{was one of the first}} major 5-HT1A receptor <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> to be discovered.|$|R
50|$|An agonist is a {{chemical}} capable of binding to a receptor, {{such as a}} neurotransmitter receptor, and initiating the same reaction typically produced by the binding of the endogenous substance. An agonist of a neurotransmitter will thus initiate the same receptor response as the transmitter. In neurons, an agonist drug may activate neurotransmitter receptors either directly or indirectly. Direct-binding agonists can be further characterized as <b>full</b> <b>agonists,</b> partial agonists, inverse agonists.|$|R
50|$|Both mitragynine and 7-HMG are {{selective}} <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> of the μ-opioid receptor; 7-HMG {{appears to}} have higher affinity. The stimulant effects appear be mediated via prevention of activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and postsynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors. Rhynchophylline is a non-competitive NMDA antagonist found in kratom.|$|R
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its affinity for the androgen receptor, DHEA has also been found to bind to and activate the ERα and ERβ estrogen receptors with Ki values of 1.1 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively, and EC50 values of >1 μM and 200 nM, respectively. Though it {{was found to be}} a partial agonist of the ERα with a maximal efficacy of 30–70%, the concentrations required for this degree of activation make it unlikely that the activity of DHEA at this receptor is physiologically meaningful. Remarkably however, DHEA acts as a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> of the ERβ with a maximal response similar to or actually slightly greater than that of estradiol, and its levels in circulation and local tissues in the human body are high enough to activate the receptor to the same degree as that seen with circulating estradiol levels at somewhat higher than their maximal, non-ovulatory concentrations; indeed, when combined with estradiol with both at levels equivalent to those of their physiological concentrations, overall activation of the ERβ was doubled. As such, it has been proposed that DHEA may be an important and potentially major endogenous estrogen in the body.|$|E
25|$|Lorcaserin is a <b>full</b> <b>agonist</b> for 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B receptors {{and partial}} agonist for 5-HT2A receptors (75% of the maximal {{response}} elicited by serotonin). Lorcaserin {{is a potent}} and selective 5-HT2C agonist with rapid oral absorption that shows dose-dependent decrease in food intake and body weight. Lorcaserin affects body weight by producing a negative energy balance through reduced food intake (energy intake) without alterations in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Lorcaserin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptors, with 18-fold selectivity over 5-HT2A receptors and 104-fold over 5-HT2B receptors. The predicted blood concentration to stimulate 2A and 2B receptors is approximately 1400-fold for 2B and 250-fold for 2A, above the blood concentration that is required to stimulate the 2C receptors. This functional selectivity is critical to prevent potential side effects and suggests that the theoretical risk of cardiac valvulopathy is very low. Clinical trials have supported this theory since they have not revealed any side effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure like the former obesity drugs. Lorcaserin is well tolerated in general, but the most frequent adverse effect are headache, nausea and dizziness.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{indicate that}} CB 2 receptor ligands {{have the potential}} to become therapeutically important. To explore this potential, it is necessary to develop compounds with high affinity for the CB 2 receptor. Very recently, we have identified the oxazinoquinoline carboxamides as a novel class of CB 2 receptor <b>full</b> <b>agonists.</b> In this paper we describe the medicinal chemistry of a new series of heteroaryl- 4 -oxopyridine/ 7 oxopyrimidine derivatives. Some of the reported compounds showed high affinity and potency at the CB 2 receptor while showing only modest affinity for the centrally expressed CB 1 cannabinoid receptor. Moreover, we found that the functionality of these ligands is controlled {{by the nature of the}} heteroaryl function condensed with the pyridine ring. In 3, 5 -cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assays, the novel series show dose-dependent effects on the modulation of forskolin-induced cAMP production, revealing different behaviors as <b>full</b> <b>agonists,</b> partial agonists, and inverse agonists...|$|R

40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{understanding of the}} precise mode of action and/or adverse outcome pathway (MoA/AOP) of chemicals has become a key step toward {{the development of a}} new generation of predictive toxicology tools. One of the challenges of this process is to test the feasibility of the molecular modelling approaches to explore key molecular initiating events (MIE) within the integrated strategy of MoA/AOP characterisation. The description of MoAs leading to toxicity and liver damage has been the focus of much interest. Growing evidence underlines liver PPARγ ligand-dependent activation as a key MIE in the elicitation of liver steatosis. Synthetic PPARγ <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> are of special concern, since they may trigger a number of adverse effects not observed with partial agonists. In this study, molecular modelling was performed based on the PPARγ complexes with <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> extracted from the Protein Data Bank. The receptor binding pocket was analysed, and the specific ligand-receptor interactions were identified for the most active ligands. A pharmacophore model was derived, and the most important pharmacophore features were outlined and characterised in relation to their specific role for PPARγ activation. The results are useful for the characterisation of the chemical space of PPARγ <b>full</b> <b>agonists</b> and could facilitate the development of preliminary filtering rules for the effective virtual ligand screening of compounds with PPARγ full agonistic activity...|$|R
