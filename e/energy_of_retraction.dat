40|$|Aims: Histological and histochemical {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pocket <b>of</b> pars tensa of {{tympanic membrane}} in children. Identification of morphological abnormalities {{in comparison with}} a healthy tympanic membrane as it is described in standard textbook. Identification of signs typical for cholesteatoma and support for a <b>retraction</b> theory <b>of</b> cholesteatoma formation. Study design: A prospective study analysing 31 samples <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pockets taken during surgery. Departments: University Hospital, Children’s Medical Centre Methods: Samples <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pockets were processed by a standard process for light microscopy, stained by haematoxylin-eosin. Van Gieson’s stain was used for differential staining of collagen, Verhoeff’s stain for elastic fibre tissues, Alcian blue for acidic polysaccharides and PAS (Periodic Acid Schiff) method for basement membrane polysaccharides. Results: The following findings were observed in the samples <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pockets: hyperkeratosis (100 %), hypervascularisations (100 %), subepithelial fragmented elastic fibres (96 %), myxoid changes (87 %), subepithelial inflammatory infiltration (84 %), rete pegs (71 %), papilomatosis (71 %), intraepithelial inflammatory cellularizations, (48 %), intraepithelial spongiosis (16 %) and parakeratosis (3 %). No basement membrane continuity interruptions were observed. Thickness <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pocket, thickness <b>of</b> epidermis, occurrence of rete pegs and frequency of fragmented elastic fibres was higher in a Grade III stage RP than Grade II stage RP (according to Charachon). Conclusion: Morphological abnormalities in the structure <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pockets in comparison with a healthy tympanic membranewere described. The changes are typical for a structure of cholesteatoma (these changes are common in matrix and perimatrix), supporting <b>retraction</b> theory <b>of</b> its origin. Our observations show that it is inflammation that probably {{plays a key role}} in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pocket. The frequency of some of the changes increases with the stage <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> pocket (II–III according to Charachon).

30|$|Data {{synthesis}} found {{a statistically}} significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> between the two groups with a std mean difference of −[*] 0.38  mm. This difference cannot be considered to be clinically significant. The standard mean difference detected between the two groups was represented by the distance between the tip of the UI and the SV vertical reference line which does not truly reflect the amount <b>of</b> bodily <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the UI but rather represents both bodily and angular changes in the anteroposterior direction. The different mechanics and archwires used by different operators could easily influence these results. This finding was surprising as there was a 2.5 -mm difference in the amount of anchorage loss between the two methods. This might lead to an expectation <b>of</b> more <b>retraction</b> in the en masse/miniscrew group. Another aspect was that the cases included in these studies were either diagnosed with class II division 1 or bi-maxillary proclination. In the bi-maxillary proclination cases, even though extractions were needed, most of the space is used to correct the inclination rather than the position of the UI. Furthermore, the amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the upper arch is limited by the position of the lower anterior teeth. The amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the anterior teeth in the lower arch controls that of the upper regardless of the space available in the upper.|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{efficiency}} and treatment outcome of patients treated with corticotomy-assisted en-masse orthodontic retraction {{as compared with the}} en-masse retraction without corticotomy. Materials and Methods: Forty adult patients with bimaxillary protrusion requiring correction of bidental proclination constituted the sample. The study group consisted of 22 patients (male 11, female 11) willing to undergo surgery to reduce the duration of their orthodontic treatment and 18 patients (male 9, female 9) desirous of undergoing conventional orthodontic treatment without surgical intervention constituted the control group. Comparison <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> and anchor loss between the study and the control group was assessed. Results: Average rate of space closure of 1. 8 mm/month in the maxilla and 1. 57 mm/month in the mandible was observed in the study group compared to 1. 02 mm/month in the maxilla and 0. 87 mm/month in the mandible in the control group. The rate <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> accelerated during the first 2 months <b>of</b> <b>retraction.</b> Molar anchor loss of approximately 0. 6 mm occurred in the study group, and 1. 8 mm occurred in the control group during the 4 months.

40|$|In many {{contexts}} a <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> {{commitment is}} frowned upon. For instance, {{it is not}} appreciated, generally, if one withdraws a promise or denies an earlier statement. Critical discussion, too, can easily be disrupted by retractions, if these occur too frequently and at critical points. But on the other hand, the very goal of critical discussion - resolution of a dispute - involves a <b>retraction,</b> either <b>of</b> doubt, or of some expressed point of view. A person who never retracts, not even under pressure of cogent arguments, would hardly qualify as a reasonable discussant. Also, inconsistencies in one's position, once they have been pointed out, {{must be dealt with}} by some kind <b>of</b> <b>retraction.</b> The problem <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> is to find a suitable model of dialogue that allows retractions where they seem reasonable, or even required, and rules them out (or puts sanctions upon them) whenever they would become disruptive of a well-organized process of dialogue. The present paper tries to point to a solution based on the following principles: (1) Retraction rules determine what retractions are permissible, and (2) if permissible what the consequences <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> are. (3) Retraction rules vary according to the type of dialogue and (4) according to the type of commitment retracted. For instance, assertions and mere concessions need to be distinguished, as well as light-side and dark-side commitments. (5) To account for our contradictory intuitions on the issue <b>of</b> <b>retractions,</b> one may best resort to a complex type of dialogue in which different retraction rules hold for different parts. The paper explains. summarizes, and expands upon the discussion <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> in Commitment in Dialogue by Douglas Walton and the present author (1995) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} amount of {{anchorage}} loss of the maxillary posterior teeth and amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the maxillary anterior teeth between en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 30 female adult patients with Class I maloc-clusion and lip protrusion who needed maximum posterior anchorage. The sample was subdivided into group 1 (n 15, mean age 21. 4 years, en masse retraction) and group 2 (n 15, mean age 24. 6 years, two-step retraction). Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T 1) and after treatment (T 2). Nine skeletal and 10 anchorage variables were measured, and independent t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Although the amount <b>of</b> horizontal <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the maxillary anterior teeth was not different between the two groups, there was mild labial movement of the root apices of the upper incisors in group 2 at T 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in the degree of anchorage loss of the maxillary posterior teeth between the two groups. Bodily and mesial movements of the upper molars occurred in both groups. Approximately 4 mm <b>of</b> the <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the upper incisal edges resulted from 1 mm of anchorage loss in the upper molars in both groups. Conclusion: No significant differences existed in the degree of anchorage loss of the upper posterior teeth and the amount <b>of</b> <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the upper anterior teeth associated with en masse retraction and two-step <b>retraction</b> <b>of</b> the anterior teeth.

40|$|<b>Retraction</b> <b>of</b> the taut, {{trailing}} {{portion of}} a moving chick heart fibroblast in vitro is an abrupt dynamic process.

Time-lapse cinemicrography shows that retraction produces a sudden, massive movement of both surface and cytoplasmic material toward a cluster of focal contacts near {{the main body of the}} cell. The appearance of folds on the upper cell surface at this time and the absence of endocytotic vesicles are consistent with this forward movement. <b>Retraction</b> <b>of</b> the trailing edge, either occurring naturally or produced artificially with a microneedle, consists of an initial fast component followed and overlapped by a slow component.
