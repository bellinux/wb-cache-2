The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the <b>get,</b> <b>if</b> he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do {{what he wants to do}} anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.|$|E

Craig Harris of IGN gave the game an [...] "outstanding" [...] 9 out of 10 stating, [...] "The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to <b>get</b> <b>if</b> you aren't already one of the upteenth billion owners of the previous games, with Crystals slight updates to the design and graphics.

Ed Morrissey, another conservative Christian writer, wrote that bending the word of God to one's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology, {{rather than the other}} way around. Joseph Farah, editor-in-chief of WorldNetDaily, stated: [...] "I've seen some incredibly stupid and misguided initiatives by 'conservatives' in my day, but this one takes the cake" [...] and [...] "There's certainly nothing 'conservative' about rewriting the Bible". Creation Ministries International wrote [...] "Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles." ...|$|E

500|$|Wayne Robins from Newsday {{believed}} that the song exemplified the [...] "kind of random pop we'd <b>get</b> <b>if</b> [...] William Burroughs were the program director of a Top 40 radio station." [...] Burt compared the song and Madonna's delivery of the lyrics with the dialogues spoken by Shakespeare's Juliet, and found similarity in the, [...] "Sweet so would I, Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing" [...] from the play, with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish". Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion, felt that [...] "Cherish" [...] as the opening song of the B-side of Like a Prayer, reaffirmed the sweet and happy romanticism that was missing from the A-side of the album. [...] "As much a child of pop" [...] he says, [...] "as of the church, Madonna is restored by music's healing power, in this case with a mixture of classic sweet soul and L.A. pop moderne." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, felt that the song was typical of Madonna's previous musical endeavors, and would have been more suitable for her third studio album, True Blue, whose songs mainly dealt with romance and relationships. Music critic J. D. Considine, while reviewing the Like a Prayer album for Rolling Stone complimented the song for creating an effective balance, contrasting its lighthearted nature with the trauma of [...] "Oh Father", the next song. Considine also found retro-rock references in the song.|$|E

[...] "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will <b>get.</b> <b>If</b> we didn't play against better standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have come this far. We were the king of the jungle from where we achieved the Test status. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level.

Out of context, Electronic Sound would sound maudlin, even dull. Here, as a key step in the progression of Harrison the solo artist, it sounds audacious in its primitiveness ..." ...|$|E
