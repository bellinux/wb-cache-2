50|$|His major {{innovation}} was {{improving the}} procedure for drilling crude oil. The Attock Oil Company at Rawalpindi (representative of Messers Steel Brothers & Co London) had confronted a peculiar problem, wherein the mud used for drilling operation got hardened upon contact with the saline water, thereby clogging the drill holes. Bhatnagar realised that this problem could be solved by colloidal chemistry. He added an <b>Indian</b> <b>gum,</b> which had the remarkable property of lowering the viscosity of the mud suspension and of increasing {{at the same time}} its stability against the flocculating action of electrolytes. M/s Steel Brothers was so pleased that they offered Bhatnagar a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- for research work on any subject related to petroleum. The company placed the fund through the university and it was used to establish the Department of Petroleum Research under the guidance of Bhatnagar. Investigations carried out under this collaborative scheme included deodourisation of waxes, increasing flame height of kerosene and utilisation of waste products in vegetable oil and mineral oil industries. Acknowledging the commercial success of the research, the company increased the fund, and extended the period from five years to ten years.|$|E

Gum gellan, a microbial heteropolysaccharide, was employed for similar {{purpose in the}} case of gold nanoparticles [6]. Gum ghatti is a naturally occurring water soluble, complex polysaccharide derived as an exudate from the bark of Anogeissus latifolia (Combretaceae family), a native tree of the Indian sub-continent. The name gum ghatti has originated from its transportation through mountain passes or ghats. This native <b>Indian</b> <b>gum</b> is collected from the forests by the tribals and marketed through government organizations such as Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Visakhapatnam, India. The world production of gum ghatti is about 1, 000 – 1, 500 MT/year [7, 8]. This biopolymer is an arabinogalactan type of natural gum and its morphological, structural, physico-chemical, compositional, solution, thermal, rheological, and emulsifying properties have been well documented and studied [9 – 17]. This biopolymer is a high-arabinose, protein rich, acidic heteropolysaccharide, occurring in nature as mixed calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salt [12 – 14, 16]. The primary structure of this gum is composed of sugars such as, l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-xylose, and d-glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 48 : 29 : 10 : 5 : 10 and < 1 % of rhamnose, which is present as non-reducing end-groups. The gum contains alternating 4 -O- substituted and 2 -O-substituted α d-mannopyranose units and chains of 1 → 6 linked β d-galactopyranose units with side chains of l-arabinofuranose residues. Six percent of rhamnose in the polysaccharide is linked to the galactose backbone as α-Rhap-(1 → 4) β-galactopyranose side chain. It has a molecular weight of 8.94 × 107 g/mol [12, 13, 15, 16].|$|E

The objective of the present study is to estimate the total polyphenolic content in aqueous and methanolic extract prepared from the bark of Acacia nilotica plant species. Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex Del commonly known as babul, kikar or <b>Indian</b> <b>gum</b> Arabic tree, has been recognized worldwide as a multipurpose tree. Mostly it occurs as an isolated tree and rarely found in patches to a limited extent in forests and has been widely planted on farms throughout the plains of the Indian subcontinent. The bark, root, gum, leaves and flowers have found use for skin diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, cough, diabetes, eczema, wound healing, burning sensation and as an astringent, demulcent, anti-asthmatic. For present work the bark of well identified A. nilotica (L) plant for the extraction of phytochemicals was done from the village Khargawali (Hoshangabad district). 20 - 20 grams of the fine powdered sample were subjected to soxhlet extraction with 200 ml distilled water and 40 % methanol separately at 70 oC and 50 oC respectively, for 24 hours and concentrated. The percentage yield so obtained was 35 and 32. 5 % respectively. The extracts were then subjected for preliminary phytochemical screening of alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids and glycosides the results of which refers to data given in this article. The total phenolic content of the extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method with suitable modification. When compared with the gallic acid standard curve the aqueous extract of 0. 01 mg/ml dilution contains 0. 323 mg/ml approx of total polyphenol content and that of the methanolic extract of the same concentration shows 0. 422 mg/ml approx concentration of TPC. Thus from the present study it can be concluded that the aqueous and methanolic extracts A. nilotica are rich in TPC, the potential of which could be utilized in many ways after further advance studies and proper data generation for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
