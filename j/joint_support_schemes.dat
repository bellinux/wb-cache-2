40|$|In June 2009, a new EU {{directive}} on {{the promotion}} of renewable energy sources (RES) entered into effect. The directive 2009 / 28 /EC, provides for three cooperation mechanisms that will allow member states to achieve their national RES target in cooperation with other member states: statistical transfer, joint projects, and <b>joint</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> This article analyses {{the pros and cons}} of the three mechanisms and explores design options for their implementation through strategic and economic questions: How to counterbalance the major drawbacks of each mechanism? How to reflect a balance of costs and benefits between the involved member states? The analysis identifies a number of design options that respond to these questions, e. g. long term contracts to ensure sufficient flexibility for statistical transfers, a coordinated, standardised joint project approach to increase transparency in the European market, and a stepwise harmonisation of <b>joint</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> that is based on a cost-effective accounting approach. One conclusion is that the three cooperation mechanisms are closely interlinked. One can consider their relation to be a gradual transition from member state cooperation under fully closed national support systems in case of statistical transfers, to cooperation under fully open national support systems in a joint support scheme.

40|$|In December 2008, the European Council and the European Parliament {{agreed on}} a final {{compromise}} for a new European renewable energy directive. One of the most debated issues prior to this compromise was the design of "target flexibility mechanisms", which should allow member states with low or expensive renewable energy potential to partly fulfil their national renewable energy target in other countries. This article traces back the political discussion {{that has led to}} the evolution of the different flexibility options. It then evaluates the most prominent flexibility mechanisms against a set of qualitative criteria. It concludes that free or restricted certificate trade based on guarantees of origin (GOs) - as proposed earlier by the European Commission - is not a viable option due to some "knockout" criteria, despite other potential advantages. The mechanisms that have replaced GO trade in the final compromise - joint projects, <b>joint</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> and statistical transfer between member states - provide less flexibility, but score better against a number of other important criteria. The crucial question for the coming years is how their utilisation can be facilitated. One first step might be that proactive member states define open design issues for implementing the mechanisms.

40|$|Offshore wind {{projects}} require large investments. Therefore, {{they currently}} need governmental support to become competitive and economically attractive for investors. There {{is a general}} consensus that a feed-in premium scheme would be most adequate to support offshore wind generation in the North Sea. With increasing distance from shore, scarcity of adequate cable routes, and an increasing need to reduce cost, cross-border projects between two or more North Sea states come into discussion. After discussing different <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> we argue that existing nationally oriented instruments have to be amended to become applicable to cross-border projects envisioned in the North Sea. In order to support our arguments quantitatively, we introduce a novel optimization framework that is able {{to account for the}} impact of implementing different types of feed-in premium based wind <b>supporting</b> <b>schemes</b> (generation-based and capacity-based) {{on the development of the}} offshore grid in the North Sea region. For a given level of support for wind development, an optimal plan includes the grid and offshore wind capacities. The transmission capacities are set in such a way that the congestion revenue collected throughout the life time of the project pays off the investment cost of building the grid. At the same time, the remuneration of the offshore wind farms pays off the unsubsidized initial investment cost of building the wind farms, provided that the premium level is selected adequately. Numerical simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and appraise the quality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper will end with an outlook of how such a <b>joint</b> <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> might be implemented...|$|R
40|$|The new Directive 2009 / 28 /EC {{stipulates}} an ambitious, {{legally binding}} {{target of a}} 20 per cent renewable energy share in overall energy consumption in the European Union by 2020. In addition to national <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> Member States may implement measures of cooperation, such as statistical transfers, <b>joint</b> or coordinated <b>support</b> mechanisms, and <b>joint</b> projects. National <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> constitute crucial determinants for the investment decision of renewable electricity producers and can hence no longer be seen in isolation. With the newly adopted Directive {{and the possibility of}} measures for cooperation, the interesting question emerges how this will impact the choice and design of national <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> i. e., if there will be a convergence or divergence in <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design in the race towards the 2020 target. This paper seeks to investigate to what extent we can already observe convergence or divergence in national <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design for meeting the renewable energy targets. The analysis consists of two steps: firstly, based on a case study on the support for wind energy in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom, the historical evolution of support legislation will be examined to find out if any trends in <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design have already materialized.

40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{benefits from}} cooperating among member states on meeting the 2020 RES targets. Today countries are supporting investments in renewable energy by {{many different types}} of support schemes and with different levels of support. The EU has opened for cooperation mechanisms such as <b>joint</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for promoting renewable energy to meet the 2020 targets. The potential coordination benefits, with more efficient localisation and composition of renewable investment, can be achieved by creating new areas/sub-segments of renewable technologies where support costs are shared and credits are transferred between countries. Countries that are not coordinating support for renewable energy might induce inefficient investment in new capacity that would have been more beneficial elsewhere and still have provided the same contribution to meeting the 2020 RES targets. Furthermore, countries might find themselves competing for investment in a market with limited capital available. In both cases, the cost-efficiency of the renewable support policies is reduced compared to a coordinated solution. Barriers for joint support such as network regulation regarding connection of new capacity to the electricity grid and cost sharing rules for electricity transmission expansion are examined and solutions are suggested. The influence of additional renewable capacity on domestic/regional power market prices can be a barrier. The market will be influenced by for example an expansion of the wind capacity resulting in lower prices, which will affect existing conventional producers. This development will be opposed by conventional producers whereas consumers will support such a strategy. A major barrier is the timing of RES targets and the uncertainty regarding future targets. We illustrate the importance of different assumptions on future targets and the implied value of RES credits. The effect on the credit price for 2020 is presented in an exemplary case study of 200 MW wind capacity. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, three joint {{processing}} {{schemes for}} the downlink are characterized and compared within {{a cluster of}} base stations. The motivation {{of this study is}} to analyze the performance of these schemes over the cluster area, as a first step towards designing an adaptive <b>joint</b> processing <b>scheme</b> <b>supporting</b> dynamic usage scenarios. Each one of the analyzed schemes, the centralized, partial and distributed joint processing approaches, requires a different amount of available channel knowledge at the transmitter side, inter-base information exchange and feedback from the users. In addition, these schemes show varying capabilities to serve the users depending on their location in the cluster area. Therefore, in a real scenario, an adaptive joint processing scheme encompassing the three schemes could be used by the cluster of base stations. Simulation results show that, assuming coherent transmission, the centralized joint processing scheme outperforms with 25 % the partial joint processing scheme and with 50 % the distributed joint processing approach in the cell edge when a backhaul-load weighted average sum-rate per cell metric is taken into account...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Union’s {{renewable}} energy policy and its multiple objectives, the Member States of the Union have introduced national <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity. These <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> are not harmonized, {{but they need}} to be carefully designed and comply with various aspects of EU law. This includes state aid concerns. Instead of following the Commission’s Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 - 2020, which today guide the Member States’ <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design to quite a large extent, this thesis proposes an alternative way for Member States to comply with state aid law when <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity are designed. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify whether schemes for the promotion of renewable electricity could potentially, as EU law stands today, be classified as services in the general economic interest (SGEI), and to clarify potential difficulties that a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity would face in relation to material compatibility with EU law if it was classified as an SGEI. The idea of qualifying a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity as an SGEI rests on the thought that the production of renewable energy might be viewed as a service of general or public interest. The objectives of a renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>scheme,</b> and especially the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, could be seen as general or public interest objectives. While producing renewable energy, the energy producers might then be conceived as providing a service in the general interest, and the support that the producer receives under the <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> would be seen as compensation for the service provided. An analysis of the position of SGEI under EU law, and an attempt to give a general definition of SGEI including some limits to this definition is made. Simultaneously, the possibility to fit <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity into the definition is analysed. The possibility to include renewable electricity in the concept of SGEI is thereafter gradually analysed by reviewing environmental SGEIs, the position of public service obligations in the Electricity Directive, and existing Union soft and case law dealing with the possibility to define a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable energy as an SGEI. The study shows that the possibility to introduce a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity as an SGEI finds support in EU law, but the factual possibility to introduce a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable energy as an SGEI is circumscribed by quite a few restrictions and established SGEI characteristics...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an {{overview}} of the European Union (EU) Member States <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES) is provided. In particular, the status of the electricity generation capacity as well as the RES mixture in the Member States is described. Moreover, the different <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> such as, investment support, feed-in tariffs (FiTs), tradable green certificates, and fiscal and financial measures which the Member States have adopted for the promotion of RES technologies are discussed in detail. Some Member States are implementing a single <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for the promotion of RES for power generation (RES-E), e. g., seven Member States use FiTs, or implement a hybrid <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> by combining all or some of the four categories of the RES-E <b>supporting</b> <b>schemes.</b> Although, these <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> have increased the penetration of the RES-E technologies in the Member States, still there is a long way in order to achieve the 2020 target. The reason for this may be that the way these schemes have been used so far, i. e., either as single <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> or in combination of FiTs or tradable green certificates with investment support and fiscal and financial measures, has been ineffective. A more effective combination could be a hybrid scheme consisting of FiTs with tradable green certificates measures, {{as in the case of}} Italy and United Kingdom, that will increase the RES-E penetration and eliminate the possible technical problems which will arise from this increased penetration and have an effect in the stability of the power system...|$|R
