5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up amicably. At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly glad that Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> {{be heard over}} the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{difficulty}} in defining one {{value for the}} real wage, in some cases a real wage {{can be said to}} have unequivocally increased. This is true if: After the change, the worker can now afford any bundle of goods and services that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> afford before the change, and still have money left over. In such a situation, real wage increases no matter how inflation is calculated. Specifically, inflation could be calculated based on any good or service or combination thereof, and real wage has still increased. This of course leaves many scenarios where real wage increasing, decreasing or staying the same depends upon how inflation is calculated. These are the scenarios where the worker can buy some of the bundles that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> afford before and still have money left, {{but at the same time}} he simply cannot afford some of the bundles that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> before. This happens because some prices change more than others, which means relative prices have changed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to 13 tracks, the disc also includes bonus {{features that are}} playable on a computer. These features include demo versions of Becker's piece End of the Beginning recorded while <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>barely</b> play, {{as well as a}} demo of Go Off! from Cacophony and a recording of Becker [...] "noodling" [...] on guitar.|$|R
6000|$|Stunned by the shock, he sank {{at first}} like {{lead to the}} bottom. When he rose again, with his {{returning}} consciousness, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see that Captain Bunker had already hoisted sail, and, {{with the assistance of}} his oars, was rapidly increasing his distance from the shore. With his returning desperation he turned to strike out after him, but groaned as his one arm sank powerless to his side. A few strokes showed him the madness of the attempt; a few more convinced him that <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> return to the shore. A sudden torpor had taken possession of him--he was sinking! ...|$|R
5|$|Taft {{insisted on}} going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health. When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not {{returned}} to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but {{had been unable to}} complete because of his illness. Taft went to Asheville, North Carolina for a rest, {{but by the end of}} January, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak and was suffering from hallucinations. Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.|$|E
5|$|Como {{was born}} in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was the seventh of ten {{children}} and the first American-born child of Pietro Como and Lucia Travaglini, who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump the bellows, and play music he had heard by ear. Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons even if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como {{was a member of}} the Canonsburg Italian Band along with the father of singer Bobby Vinton, bandleader Stan Vinton, who was often a customer at his barber shop.|$|E
25|$|A running gag in {{the early}} storylines was that when Cerebus' fur got wet it gave off a horrible stench, which even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> tolerate.|$|E
5000|$|Horst Buchholz {{was born}} in Berlin, the son of Maria Hasenkamp. He never knew his {{biological}} father, but took the surname of his stepfather Hugo Buchholz, a shoemaker, whom his mother married in 1938. His half-sister Heidi, born in 1941, gave him the nickname [...] "Hotte", which he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. During World War II he was evacuated to Silesia and at the end of the war found himself in a foster home in Czechoslovakia. He returned to Berlin as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>barely</b> finished his schooling before seeking theater work, first appearing on stage in 1949. He soon left his childhood home in East Berlin to work in West Berlin. He established himself in the theater, notably the Schiller Theater, and also on radio.|$|R
500|$|The public {{flocked to}} Adams' exhibitions; often the pool room where <b>he</b> was {{performing}} <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> contain the crowd. When Adams performed in Rochester, New York in 1892, {{the local paper}} reported that [...] "o man in these broad acres can draw the crowd [...] "Yank" [...] Adams does when an exhibition with the ivories is the card. Last night's crowd was banked up, against the walls, twenty deep in someplaces and many witnessed the exhibition from the table tops and window ledges." ...|$|R
50|$|Herla, {{who thought}} he had been away for just three days, is so amazed <b>he</b> <b>barely</b> <b>could</b> stay in the saddle. Some of his men jump down from their horses, only to crumble quickly into dust. Herla warns his {{remaining}} companions not to dismount until the dog alights, but the dog, Map says wryly, has not yet alighted, and Herla and his host have become eternal wanderers.|$|R
25|$|Early pantomimes were {{performed}} as mimes accompanied by music, but as Music hall became popular, Grimaldi introduced the pantomime dame to the theatre and {{was responsible for}} the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk, and he retired from the theatre. By 1828, he was penniless, and Covent Garden held a benefit concert for him.|$|E
25|$|Duncan Pryde, a Hudsons Bay Company trader who {{pioneered the}} {{linguistic}} study of Inuit languages, attacked Mowat's {{claim to have}} picked up the language quickly enough in two months to discuss detailed concepts such as shamanism, {{pointing out that the}} language is complex and required a year or more for Europeans to master the basics. Pryde said that when Mowat visited his post at Baker Lake in 1958, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak a single word in the Inuit language.|$|E
25|$|In April of {{that same}} year, he married Sarah Hall Boardman, widow of fellow missionary George Boardman. They had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Sarah's health began failing and {{physicians}} recommended a return to America. Sarah died en route at St. Helena on September 1, 1845. He continued home, where he was greeted as a celebrity and toured the eastern seaboard raising the profile of and money for missionary activity. Because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak above a whisper, due to pulmonary illness, his public addresses were made by speaking to an assistant, who would then address the audience.|$|E
5000|$|Ignoring Homer, later writers envisaged the Labyrinth as an edifice {{rather than}} a single dancing path to the center and out again, and gave it numberless winding {{passages}} and turns that opened into one another, seeming to have neither beginning nor end. Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, suggests that Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth so cunningly that <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> escape it after he built it. Daedalus built the labyrinth for King Minos, who needed it to imprison his wife's son the Minotaur. The story is told that Poseidon had given a white bull to Minos {{so that he might}} use it as a sacrifice. Instead, Minos kept it for himself; and in revenge, Poseidon, with the help of Aphrodite, made Pasiphaë, King Minos's wife, lust for the bull [...] For Pasiphaë, as Greek mythologers interpreted it, Daedalus also built a wooden cow so she could mate with the bull, for the Greeks imagined the Minoan bull of the sun to be an actual, earthly bull, the slaying of which later required a heroic effort by Theseus.|$|R
60|$|Often of {{an evening}} I would {{accompany}} Hal upon his rounds. By the savage tribe he both served and ruled {{he had come to}} be regarded as medicine man and priest combined. He was both their tyrant and their slave, working for them early and late, yet bullying them unmercifully, enforcing his commands sometimes with vehement tongue, and where that would not suffice with quick fists; the counsellor, helper, ruler, literally of thousands. Of income <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have made <b>barely</b> enough to live upon; but few men could have enjoyed more sense of power; and that I think it was that held him to the neighbourhood.|$|R
60|$|At last, however, he {{did find}} a spot to lie down on, and, {{with a sigh of}} relief, lay back to indulge in repose. Alas! the spot was a myth--he merely dreamed it; the next moment he dropt, like a huge {{over-ripe}} pear, to the ground. Fortunately a bush broke the violence of his fall, and, springing up with a cry of consternation, he rushed towards the tree, expecting each instant to feel the terrible hug of his ursine enemy. The very marrow in his back-bone seemed to shrink, for he fancied that he actually felt the dreaded claws sinking into his flesh. In his haste he missed the branch, and fell violently forward, scratching himself terribly among the bushes. Again he rose, and a cold perspiration broke out upon him as he uttered an involuntary howl of terror, and once more leaped up at the limb of the oak, which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> see. <b>He</b> caught it; despair nerved him, and in another moment he was safe, and panting violently among the branches.|$|R
25|$|Charles did {{not learn}} to speak {{until the age of}} four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as {{virtually}} an infant until he was ten years old. His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak or chew. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged {{to such an extent that}} at times he was not expected to be clean. When his illegitimate half-brother John of Austria the Younger obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair.|$|E
25|$|The unfortunate black {{teenagers}} were: Haywood Patterson (age 18) {{who claimed}} that he had ridden freight trains {{for so long that}} he could light a cigarette {{on the top of a}} moving train; Clarence Norris (age 19), who had left behind ten brothers and sisters in rural Georgia; Charlie Weems (age 19); brothers Andy Wright (age 19) and Roy Wright (age 12), who were leaving home for the first time. The nearly blind Olin Montgomery (age 17), who was hoping to get a job in order to pay for a pair of glasses that he so desperately needed; Ozie Powell (age 16); Willie Roberson (age 16), who suffered from such severe syphilis that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk; and Eugene Williams (age 13); Of these nine boys, only four knew each other prior to their arrest.|$|E
25|$|With {{his wife}} {{he had three}} sons and a {{daughter}} whose filial piety made her devote her entire life to serving her genius father. Though he lived happily, one event embittered Lesage for years. His eldest son had been educated for the bar, but insisted going on stage. Lesage, who had often painted {{the life of the}} actor in the most ridiculous and hateful aspect, was pained by his son's career choice, especially when his son joined the Théâtre Français, against which Lesage had long waged a satirical war. Probably out of deference to his father, the son took the name Montménil, and by the merit of his talents and private character, soon entered the upper society of Paris. Lesage was reconciled with his son many years later and became so devoted to Montménil that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> leave his side.|$|E
50|$|He {{was invited}} to the United States in 1967, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see again several of his artworks in the {{greatest}} galleries of Chicago, and at exhibitions {{of the highest quality}} works. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> sell his paintings made in France at a high price, but he took no delight in works he created there and <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> sell them at half-price. He returned to France after three months. On an occasion of an exhibition in Paris, television showed some of his artworks and commented them as the powerful expression of the artist's feelings and misery saturated with Hungarian temperament.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Jones {{explained}} in Physics Today how he experimented {{with a traditional}} bicycle to see if cancelling the gyroscopic effect of the front wheel would make it unridable. He added a second, counter-rotating front wheel that did not touch the ground. He reported that his particular bicycle would no longer stay up without a rider, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still easily ride it, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even just <b>barely</b> ride it no-handed. It was no longer self-stable, it was still controllable, {{but it was no}} longer easily controllable. Jones also tried increasing trail, by reversing the front fork, and found that self-stability was dramatically increased, but that this made it more difficult to ride - [...] "it was too stable to be steered." [...] Finally, he made a bike with negative trail, by adding forward extensions {{to the ends of the}} fork, and found that it had negligible self-stability and was [...] "indeed very dodgy to ride, though not as impossible as he had hoped." [...] By evaluating which modifications made a bicycle easy to ride, with hands on and off, Jones concluded that gyroscopic effects were less important than trail for bicycle stability.|$|R
5000|$|Fleeman had injured {{himself in}} his {{previous}} boxing match. Nevertheless, the guaranteed prize money for the Clay-Fleeman fight was an offer <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not refuse, particularly after his wife encouraged him {{to go on with}} the fight since they needed the money. Fleeman later explained: I had fought Pete Rademacher before Clay-Fleeman bout. He had fractured my sternum. My doctor said I should not fight. I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> raise my left arm. But I had a guarantee of $3,000. So I went ahead and fought.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Aerts left Mejiro Gym {{to found}} Team Aerts, {{training}} out of Kops Gym in Amsterdam under Henry Hooft and Jan Plas. After six {{months out of}} the ring, he returned against Gary Goodridge at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Nagoya on June 6, 2004. After withstanding the Trinidadian brawler's initial onslaught, Aerts brutalised Goodridge with low kicks over two and a half rounds. Although Goodridge was still game, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> stand and the referee stopped the fight in round three. Aerts then defeated Michael McDonald by unanimous decision (30-29, 30-29, 29-27) at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 Final Elimination on September 25, 2004 to qualify for the K-1 World GP final eight. The K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 Final, held on December 4, 2004, saw Aerts go up against South African boxer Francois Botha in the quarter-finals. Aerts lost in the first round when he could not continue after injuring his leg while low kicking Botha.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey won a Heath Harrison Exhibition {{award and}} a place at Brasenose College at Oxford University to study {{geography}} {{in the autumn of}} 1951. He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 {{at the start of the}} season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. He had yet to make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but was so nervous <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> watch.|$|E
25|$|Shooting of {{the film}} was a {{draining}} experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the worker's city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of Berlin had to work for 14 days {{in a pool of}} water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature. Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fröhlich found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> stand. Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the worker's city. UFA invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film's shooting as parts of its promotion campaign.|$|E

500|$|Campbell has {{experienced}} various physical ailments {{in his later}} life. By 2001, at age 46, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> close his fist due to arthritis in his hands. He developed foot drop due to nerve damage in his legs, and has difficulty bending his back and knees. He was diagnosed with spinal stenosis in 2009. Because of his difficulty walking he uses a cane or a walker, and for longer distances a wheelchair. Campbell at first maintained the ailments were genetic, but said in 2012, [...] "I think some of it came from playing football, playing the way I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the summer, Charles Gibson, {{co-host of}} Good Morning America, and Elizabeth Vargas, co-host of 20/20, served as {{temporary}} anchors. On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com {{with an update}} of his status and expressing thanks {{to those who had}} offered him their good wishes and prayers. [...] In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional speech; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, [...] "for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News." [...] During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill to the point where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak at times. He posted another short letter of thanks on July 29, 2005, his 67th birthday.|$|E
