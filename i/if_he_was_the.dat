Walsh did not introduce taekwondo outside the eastern states.|$|E
5|$|Young Ku Yun, 8th dan (ITF), {{has been}} {{described}} as having introduced taekwondo to Sydney in 1971. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first to introduce taekwondo to Australia's largest city, then he might lay claim to the title. Yun arrived around five years after Rhee, however, and himself claimed to be the first ITF instructor (rather than the first taekwondo instructor) in Australia.|$|E
5|$|He was an {{enthusiastic}} athlete, playing soccer, rugby and baseball as a child. His passion was for basketball {{and though he}} stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight. Bob McGill, Terry's physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School, felt he was better suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport. Fox had no desire for cross-country running, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach. He was determined to continue playing basketball, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last substitute on the team. Fox played only one minute in his grade-eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten. In grade 12, he won his high school's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He considered that Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made a toast to Saavedra, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, Saavedra signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but Saavedra considered that it was a disproportionated response to a trivial issue.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring {{to him as the}} Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

Losses to England, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa put strain on his captaincy which he relinquished in Jan 2012.|$|E
25|$|If a debtor {{were seized}} for debt, he could {{nominate}} as mancipium, or hostage {{to work off}} the debt, his wife, child, or slave. The creditor could only hold a wife or child three years as mancipium. If the mancipium died a natural death while in the creditor's possession, no claim could lie against the latter; but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cause of death by cruelty, {{he had to give}} son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.|$|E

He was the son of either Gunnar or Oslac, northern ealdormen. [...] <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> former, he may have attained adulthood by the 960s, when a man of his name raided Westmorland. Other potential appearances in the records are likewise uncertain until 979, the point from which Thored's period as ealdorman can be accurately dated.|$|E

500|$|As Yamaguchi {{spent much}} of his time focused on [...] "Endless", he {{entrusted}} most of the album's arrangements to the other band members. This made Yamaguchi feel as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> director of the project, with drummer Keiichi Ejima leading the band as its captain during his absences as he focused on lyric writing. As Yamaguchi's workload was lessened, he noticed that Sakanaction were working together more like a genuine band on Documentaly. In addition to the band members, Yamaguchi felt that Sakanaction had gained a solid core of peripheral staff that helped with the recording process, compared to their previous albums.|$|E

According to Bahnsen upon {{arriving at the}} school, N'Diaye [...] "could barely get {{up and down the}} court more than a few times" [...] due to his poor fitness after rehabilitation. In his high school years, N'Diaye, who stood [...] at the time, was considered one of the tallest to play at that level. He was also approached by the Guinness World Records to determine the authenticity of the claims.

Chrimes agrees that Glanvill was probably not the author, and feels that Walter likely was, although he could not be certain. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> author, he composed what Chrimes called a [...] "great literary memorial of Henry II's government". Neither of Walter's two modern biographers, however, feel that he was the author of the Tractatus, and the historian Ralph Turner agrees. The historian Michael Clanchy says of Walter [...] "The proliferation of documents was a European and a continuing phenomenon, yet if it were to be associated in England with one man, he would be Hubert Walter." ...|$|E
500|$|Saavedra {{increased}} his resistance to Moreno's proposals after the {{victory at the}} Battle of Suipacha, considering that the revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence. The Regiment of Patricians hosted a banquet celebration at the barracks, restricting attendance to the military and supporters of Saavedra. Moreno {{was not allowed to}} pass by the guards at the door, which generated a small incident. That same night, Officer Atanasio Duarte, who was drunk, gave a crown of sugar to Saavedra's wife and saluted Saavedra as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> new king or emperor of the Americas. The next day, when Moreno heard about the incident, he wrote the [...] "Honours Suppression decree", which suppressed the ceremony usually reserved {{for the president of the}} Junta and inherited privileges of the office of viceroy. Duarte was exiled, and Moreno's act was justified by stating that [...] "An inhabitant of Buenos Aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against the freedom of his country". Saavedra signed the decree without complaint, but Gregorio Funes felt that the Patricians resented Moreno because of this.|$|E
500|$|The Fringe {{division}} {{visits a}} secured Massive Dynamic facility where the prime universe's {{version of the}} doomsday device, believed to be an artifact of the [...] "First People", has been assembled.

They are aware that before her departure, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv)—Olivia's parallel universe doppelgänger—stole one component of the unit, possibly its power source as they cannot find any other way to engage the device. However, as Peter (Joshua Jackson) nears it, the device reacts, moving into a new configuration and sending out electromagnetic pulses, while Peter suddenly has a nosebleed. Peter returns with Olivia (Torv) and Walter (John Noble) to Massive Dynamic to undergo some tests to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cause for the device's activation. Meanwhile, Broyles (Lance Reddick) asks Astrid (Jasika Nicole) to discreetly review the files pulled from Fauxlivia's computer for any hidden messages, not wishing to have Olivia or Peter be forced to learn of what Fauxlivia wrote about them.|$|E

50|$|Easy and Thomasine {{talk with}} the judge. Two {{officers}} hold Shortyard and Falselight in custody.

Quomodo insists that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Quomodo, that Thomasine is his wife and that Shortyard and Falselight are wrongfully bound. To see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real Quomodo, the judge asks Quomodo <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an infamous cheater; Quomodo says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not. <b>The</b> judge asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> man who cheated Easy out of his lands; Quomodo says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not. <b>The</b> judge says that, if these answers <b>are</b> true, then <b>he</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>the</b> real Quomodo, and must be whipped as a counterfeit.

500|$|The {{first of}} these {{qualifications}} was shattered with the Republican victory in the New York gubernatorial election in 1879. In that election, a revitalized Tammany split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden's faction (now known as the [...] "Irving Hall Democrats"). Tammany ran its new leader, [...] "Honest" [...] John Kelly, as an independent candidate for governor, allowing the Republicans to carry the state with a plurality of the vote. Tilden began to waver, issuing ambiguous statements about whether he would run again. Rumors circulated wildly {{in the months before}} the convention, with no definitive word from Tilden. As the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, Daniel Manning, suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination. Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden's letter available to the New York delegation. [...] When {{it became clear that the}} nomination would be contested, Manning revealed the contents of the Tilden letter; it was vague and inconclusive, but once is contents became known to Tilden's home state delegates, they chose to interpret it as a withdrawal. [...] The New York delegation now considered Tilden's candidacy to be ended, and sought a new standard-bearer.|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{characters}} who appear in [...] "Laryngitis" [...] are Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and AV club president Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink). Rizwan Manji plays Dr. Gidwani. Zack Weinstein guest stars as Sean Fretthold, {{a football player}} who was paralyzed below the upper chest after injuring his spinal cord at C4 in an accident, similar to the actor's injury in real life. Sean is the second wheelchair-using character to appear on Glee. In November 2009, the episode [...] "Wheels" [...] attracted criticism from disability advocates, who {{called attention to the}} fact that disabled character Artie Abrams is played by able-bodied actor Kevin McHale. Weinstein defended McHale's casting, opining that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best auditioning actor for the role, then his ability to walk should be irrelevant. However, Weinstein also stated he [...] "would like to see wheelchair users given the chance to audition and be seriously considered for roles that aren't specifically written for someone with a disability." [...] Weinstein revealed that he wished he had auditioned for the role of Artie, and that Glee was his favorite show. Around February 2010, Weinstein's agent got him an audition to play Sean, and within a week and a half, he learned he had got the part. Glee was Weinstein's first professional acting job. He called the twelve hours he spent filming his scenes [...] "twelve of the most important hours of [...] life".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Onomarchus {{returned}} to Thessaly {{to try and}} preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year. Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched Chares to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip. Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived. According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea (the 'crocus field'), probably {{in the vicinity of}} Pagasae. Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> avenger... of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god". Some of the Phocian mercenaries supposedly threw down their arms, panged by their guilty consciences. In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6000 Phocian troops had been killed including Onormarchus, and another 3000 taken prisoner. Onomarchus was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as was the ritual punishment demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians. Buckler states that: [...] "Nor should one automatically assume that a mass-drowning... would shock the Greek world. Even the mild-tempered Isocrates felt that the Phocian mercenaries were better off dead than alive... Dreadful indeed was the punishment, but it was entirely consistent with Philip's role as Apollo's champion".|$|E
