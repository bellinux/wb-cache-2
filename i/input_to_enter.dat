40|$|Previous neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the experience of flow aligns with a relative increase in activation of the dorsal raphe nucleus, and relative activation decreases of the medial prefrontal cortex and of the amygdala. In the present study, Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) was used to explore effective connectivity between those brain regions. To test our hypothesis that the dorsal raphe nucleus causally down-regulates activity of the medial prefrontal cortex and/or of the amygdala, 23 healthy male students solved mental arithmetic tasks of varying difficulty during functional magnetic resonance imaging. A flow condition, with task demands automatically balanced with participants’ skill level, was compared with conditions of boredom and overload. DCM models were constructed modeling full reciprocal endogenous connections between the dorsal raphe nucleus, the medial prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the calcarine. The calcarine was included to allow sensory <b>input</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the system. Experimental conditions were modeled as exerting modulatory effects on various possible connections between the dorsal raphe nucleus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala, but not on self-inhibitory connections, yielding a total of 64 alternative DCM models. Model space was partitioned into eight families based on commonalities in the arrangement of the modulatory effects. Random effects Bayesian Model Selection was applied to identify a possible winning family (and model). Although Bayesian Model Selection revealed a clear winning family, an outstanding winning model could not be identified. Therefore, Bayesian Model Averaging was performed over models within the winning family to obtain representative DCM parameters for subsequent analyses to test our hypothesis. In line with our expectations, Bayesian averaged parameters revealed stronger down-regulatory influence of the dorsal raphe nucleus on the medial prefrontal cortex when participants experienced flow relative to control conditions. In addition, these condition-dependent modulatory effects significantly predicted participants’ experienced degree of flow. The amygdala was down-regulated irrespective of condition. The present results suggest a causal role for the dorsal raphe nucleus in modulating the medial prefrontal cortex, contributing to the experience of flow...|$|E

Most prominently, in the attentional blink the observer often fails to detect the second of two rapidly successive targets that are presented in a sequence of distractor items. To investigate how auditory inputs enable a visual target to escape the attentional blink, this study presented the visual letter targets T 1 and T 2 together with phonologically congruent or incongruent spoken letter names. First, a congruent relative to an incongruent sound at T 2 rendered visual T 2 more visible. Second, this T 2 congruency effect was amplified when the sound was congruent at T 1 as indicated by a T 1 congruency x T 2 congruency interaction. Critically, these effects were observed both when the sounds were presented in synchrony with and prior to the visual target letters suggesting that the sounds may increase visual target identification via multiple mechanisms such as audiovisual priming or decisional interactions. Our results demonstrate that a sound around the time of T 2 increases subjects’ awareness of the visual target as a function of T 1 and T 2 congruency. Consistent with Bayesian causal inference, the brain may thus combine (1) prior congruency expectations based on T 1 congruency and (2) phonological congruency cues provided by the audiovisual inputs at T 2 to infer whether auditory and visual signals emanate from a common source and should hence be integrated for perceptual decisions...|$|R

Most prominently, in the attentional blink, the observer fails to detect the second of two rapidly successive targets that are presented in a sequence of distractor items. This study investigated whether phonological (in) congruency between visual target letters and spoken letters is modulated by subjects’ awareness. In a visual attentional blink paradigm, subjects were presented with two visual targets (buildings and capital Latin letters, respectively) in a sequence of rapidly presented distractor items. A beep was presented always with T 1. We manipulated the presence/absence and phonological congruency of the spoken letter that was presented concurrently with T 2. Subjects reported the identity of T 1 and T 2 and reported the visibility of T 2. Behaviorally, subjects correctly identified T 2 when it was reported to be either visible or unsure, while performances were below chance level when T 2 was reported to be invisible. At the neural level, the anterior cingulate was activated for invisible>unsure>visible T 2. In contrast, visible relative to invisible trials increased activation in bilateral cerebellum, pre/post-central gyri extending into parietal sulci and bilateral inferior occipital gyri. Incongruency effects were observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus and insula only for visible stimuli. In conclusion, phonological incongruency is processed differently when subjects are aware of the visual stimulus. This indicates that multisensory integration is not automatic but depends on subjects’ cognitive state...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—High speed {{networks}} provide realtime variable {{bit rate}} service with diversified traffic flow characteristics and quality requirements. The {{variable bit rate}} traffic has stringent delay and packet loss requirements. The burstiness of the correlated traffic makes dynamic buffer management highly desirable to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents an algorithm for optimization of adaptive buffer allocation scheme for traffic based on loss of consecutive packets in data-stream and buffer occupancy level. Buffer is designed <b>to</b> allow the <b>input</b> traffic <b>to</b> be partitioned into different priority classes {{and based on the}} input traffic behavior it controls the threshold dynamically. This algorithm allows <b>input</b> packets <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> into buffer if its occupancy level is less than the threshold value for priority of that packet. The threshold is dynamically varied in runtime based on packet loss behavior. The simulation is run for two priority classes of the input traffic – realtime and non-realtime classes. The simulation results show that Adaptive Partial Buffer Sharing (ADPBS) has better performance than Static Partial Buffer Sharing (SPBS) and First In First Out (FIFO) queue under the same traffic conditions.

A systematic approach is applied for implementing a digit-serial architecture in order to reduce power consumption. The resulting circuit is highly regular and programmable with respect to P(x). An analysis of the performance comparison is described as function of the digit-size. A comparison is made with the bit serial architecture based on the performance improvement with respect to computation delay and power/energy consumption of one exponentiation. Thus, the factor of merit, which could be a measure of performance, is defined as the product of energy times the delay and it is computed.

This Repository is a one-stop unique web portal to assist with construction, discussion and dissemination of measurement constructs in international business research. It has been created to collect and store measurement data which are easily accessible by authenticated users. Initially, it was designed with simple search functionality with the limited measures entered by the administrators of the Repository. This thesis is focused on enhancing the repository with several features like Advanced Search that adds additional fields to the simple search, Login System with admin features, <b>Input</b> Section <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> a measure or concept and a Forum for social interactivity. Search results will be displayed in an enhanced way that provides rich browsing experience to the user.

Surface autotrophic microbial populations were monthly collected and exposed to known nutrient concentrations and incubated under in situ light and temperature conditions. The experimental addition treatments included: a) inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonium and phosphate); b) B 12 vitamin (cobalamin) and c) inorganic nutrients and cobalamin.
