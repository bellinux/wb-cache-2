Based on an analysis of 240 L 2 postgraduate dissertations totalling 4 million words, we offer a reassessment of metadiscourse, propose what we hope is a more robust model, and use this to explore how these students used metadiscourse. Essentially our argument is that metadiscourse offers a way of understanding the interpersonal resources writers use to present propositional material and therefore a means of uncovering something of the rhetorical and social distinctiveness of disciplinary communities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In this paper, I explore how advanced second language writers deploy these resources in a high stakes research genre. The paper examines the purposes and distributions of metadiscourse in a corpus of 240 doctoral and masters dissertations totalling four million words written by Hong Kong students. The paper proposes a model of metadiscourse as the interpersonal resources required to present propositional material appropriately in different disciplinary and genre contexts. The analysis suggests how academic writers use language to offer a credible representation of themselves and their work in different fields, and thus how metadiscourse {{can be seen as a}} means of uncovering something of the rhetorical and social distinctiveness of disciplinary communities. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Metadiscourse is {{the term}} used for self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions that refer to the <b>evolving</b> <b>text,</b> to the writer, and to the imagined readers of that text. It {{is based on a}} view of writing as social engagement and in academic contexts reveals the ways writers project themselves into their discourse to signal their attitudes and commitments to matters in the text and to their disciplinary communities. This paper examines the frequencies and pragmatic purposes of metadiscourse in the relatively neglected academic genre of the book review. On the basis of a corpus of 84 reviews from three contrasting disciplines and interviews with journal editors and reviewers, we describe the ways these writers use metadiscourse to offer a credible representation of themselves and their work in different fields. The analysis shows how metadiscourse use can be seen as pragmatic strategies through which writers shape their social purposes to the formal constraints of the genre and the preferred practices of their disciplines. It therefore suggests how this genre not only draws on readers' familiarity with disciplinary knowledge of the field, but also an interpretive framework that includes appropriate social interactions. © Walter de Gruyter 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The bag-of-words {{representation}} {{commonly used}} in text analysis can be analyzed very efficiently and retains {{a great deal of}} useful information, but it is also troublesome because the same thought can be expressed using many different terms or one term can have very different meanings. Dimension reduction can collapse together terms that have the same semantics, to identify and disambiguate terms with multiple meanings and to provide a lower-dimensional representation of documents that reflects concepts instead of raw terms. In this chapter, we survey two influential forms of dimension reduction. Latent semantic indexing uses spectral decomposition to identify a lower-dimensional representation that maintains semantic properties of the documents. Topic modeling, including probabilistic latent semantic indexing and latent Dirichlet allocation, is a form of dimension reduction that uses a probabilistic model to find the co-occurrence patterns of terms that correspond to semantic topics in a collection of documents. We describe the basic technologies in detail and expose the underlying mechanism. We also discuss recent advances that have made it possible to apply these techniques to very large and <b>evolving</b> <b>text</b> collections and to incorporate network structure or other contextual information. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{real world}} user demands, we {{demonstrate}} how animated visualisation of <b>evolving</b> <b>text</b> corpora displays the underlying dynamics of semantic content. To interpret the results, one needs a dynamic theory of word meaning.

We demonstrate our methodology by two-way seriation which is a popular technique to analyse groups of similar instances and their features, {{as well as the}} connections between the groups themselves. The two-way seriated data may be visualised as a two-dimensional heat map or as a three-dimensional landscape where colour codes or height correspond to the values in the matrix. In this paper we focus on two-way seriation of sparse data in the Reuters- 21568 test collection. To achieve a meaningful visualisation thereof we introduce a compactly supported convolution kernel similar to filter kernels used in image reconstruction and geostatistics. This filter populates the high-dimensional sparse space with values that interpolate nearby elements, and provides insight into the clustering structure. We also extend two-way seriation to deal with online updates of both the row and column spaces, and, combined with the convolution kernel, demonstrate a three-dimensional visualisation of dynamics...|$|E
40|$|In this talk, I hope to {{accomplish}} three things. First, I will give some historical background on ‘metadiscourse ’ and ‘evaluation ’ in text research. Second, I will discuss issues of delimitation and present arguments in favour of drawing a distinction between metadiscourse and evaluation. Third, I will contrast metadiscourse and evaluation by presenting examples of both from a corpus of academic writing and comparing their relative frequencies. Metadiscourse is self-reflective linguistic expressions referring to the <b>evolving</b> <b>text</b> per se or its linguistic form, including references to the writer persona and the imagined reader qua writer and reader of the current text. Evaluation, on the other hand, concerns linguistic material that expresses the speaker’s attitude towards what is said.
