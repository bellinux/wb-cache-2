25|$|Finally it {{was decided}} to restore the castle. Archaeological and {{architectural}} research started in 1953 and long restoration works began in 1957. The restoration was done to the last (Baroque) state of the main building, but at many places older (Gothic, Renaissance) preserved elements or parts have been restored. The Theresianum has not been restored and the Hillebrandt building of 1762 was restored only around the year 2000. The Slovak painter Janko Alexy gained recognition for the restoration of the castle. The finishing of the restoration in 1968 was interrupted in August 1968, when the castle was occupied by Warsaw Pact troops (see Prague Spring). On 28 October 1968, however, the Federation Law, turning the centralist state of Czechoslovakia into a federation of a Czech Socialist Republic (later called Czech Republic) and a Slovak Socialist Republic (later called Slovak Republic), was signed in the Federation Hall of the castle. On 3 September 1992, the new constitution of independent Slovakia was signed in the <b>Knights</b> <b>Hall</b> of the castle.|$|E
25|$|During 1766-1785 on {{the basis}} of Jakub Fontana's plans, the {{southern}} wing of the castle, which was burnt on 15 December 1767 was rebuilt (2 destroyed floors, a new elevation on the south side with three rysalits, the division of the façade by lizens and Jon capital pilasters). Between 1774 and 1777 the monarch's private apartments were furnished. They consisted of the Prospect Room (with landscapes by Canaletto), the Chapel, the Audience Chamber, and the Bedchamber, while between 1779 and 1786 the Senate Apartments were completed, consisting of the Ballroom, the <b>Knights</b> <b>Hall,</b> the Throne Room, the Marble Room, and the Conference Chamber. These rooms contained pictures and sculptures depicting great events in Poland's history, as well as portraits of Polish kings, generals, statesmen and scholars (including Copernicus and Adam Naruszewicz). The Castle also housed the rich royal collections including 3200 pictures, classical statues, about 100 000 graphics, in addition to medals, coins, and a fine library, to house which a separate building was erected in 1780-1784. The new library building housed many books, gems, drawings, coins, maps and plans belonging to the monarch. The Royal Library's book collection amounted to 16 000 volumes of various works, 25,525 drawings, 44,842 etchings in 726 bound volumes, overall a number of 70,000 etchings—fancy dress balls were also held in this hall.|$|E

50|$|Once the Van Arkel’s regained enough {{wealth to}} rebuild the Castle the {{original}} architecture had become obsolete. As a result, the family made severe changes to the original layout of the Castle. They restored the outside to essentially the same design as the original, but changed they inside considerably. Given how much architectural styles had changed since the Castle was founded, is very surprising that the then Lord, Thomas Walraven Van Arkel, chose to restore the outside with traditional medieval style. Given the changes in architectural styles, {{the interior of the}} Castle was transformed to a much more comfortable living space. The original Castle had traditional, large rooms with high ceilings. Among these large rooms was the large <b>knights</b> <b>hall.</b> These sorts of rooms were very common in medieval Castles. When the Van Arkel’s repaired the Castle they got rid of the grand hall, elected to have numerous, smaller rooms instead.|$|E

The last owners of the castle, the Buqouy family (who were Czech nobles of French origin), transformed it into a museum open to the public, one of the first museums in the Bohemian land.
