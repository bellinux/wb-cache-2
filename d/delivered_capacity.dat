5000|$|Manufacturers {{specify the}} {{capacity}} of a battery at a specified discharge rate. For example, a battery might be rated at 100 A·h when discharged at a rate that will fully discharge the battery in 20 hours (at 5 amperes for this example). If discharged at a faster rate the <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> is less. Peukert's law describes a power relationship between the discharge current (normalized to some base rated current) and <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> (normalized to the rated capacity) over some specified range of discharge currents. If Peukert's constant , the exponent, were equal to unity, the <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> would be independent of the current. For a real battery the exponent is greater than unity, and capacity decreases as discharge rate increases. For a lead-acid battery [...] is typically between 1.1 and 1.3. For different lead-acid rechargeable battery technologies it generally ranges from 1.05 to 1.15 for VRSLAB AGM batteries, from 1.1 to 1.25 for gel, and from 1.2 to 1.6 for flooded batteries. The Peukert constant varies with the age of the battery, generally increasing (getting worse) with age. Application at low discharge rates must take into account the battery self-discharge current. At very high currents, practical batteries will give less capacity than predicted with a fixed exponent. The equation {{does not take into account}} the effect of temperature on battery capacity.|$|E

The company was allowed to resume shipbuilding already in 1949. Production could soon be continued, starting with repair of ships and locomotives and the construction of fishing vessels. Soon later the shipbuilding programme was enlarged and various types of ships were offered to the market as container/multi purpose cargo ships, passenger liners, passenger-cargo vessels, roll-on/roll-off ships, LNG and LPG tankers, supply ships, special-purpose ships, reefer vessels and others.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{geometrical}} parameters of interdigitated batteries, including the number, thickness {{and the length of}} the digits, on battery <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> was investigated in order to optimize battery performance. This optimization was carried out in two dimensions maintaining constant the area of the different components and based on the Doyle/Fuller/Newman theoretical model that describes the electrochemical and ionic transport processes within separator and electrodes. It is observed that the <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> of the battery increases with increasing the number of digits as well as by increasing the thickness and the length of the digits, which is related to the smaller path for lithium ion movement during the intercalation/deintercalation processes. Thus, an optimized interdigitated geometry with eight digits shows a <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> of 323 Ah. m- 2 at 350 C in comparison with 0. 7 Ah. m- 2 for a conventional geometry.

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{separator}} membrane physical parameters such as degree of porosity, tortuosity and thickness, on battery <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> was studied {{in order to}} optimize performance of lithium-ion batteries. This was achieved by a theoretical mathematical model relating the Bruggeman coefficient with the degree of porosity and tortuosity. The inclusion of the separator membrane in the simulation model of the battery system {{does not affect the}} <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> of the battery. The ionic conductivity of the separator and consequently the <b>delivered</b> <b>capacity</b> values obtained at different discharge rates depends on the value of the Bruggeman coefficient, which is related with the degree of porosity and tortuosity of the membrane.

40|$|Nowadays, efficient, safe, {{low cost}} and {{environmentally}} friendly storage systems are required {{in response to}} the modern society needs. Li-ion batteries (LIBs), considered one of the promising systems to fulfill these requirements, represent the most widespread secondary battery for consumer and portable electronics and possibly for power hybrid and electric vehicles. [1] Stationary energy storage, in contrast to high energy density applications, is principally driven by cost rather than high performances in terms of energy density. Therefore, batteries with alternative chemistry, complementary to and not competing with the lithium-ion battery technology are necessary. Recently, sodium-ion batteries have attracted large attention since, in principle, suitable to match the economic and environmental issues due to the high abundance and low cost of the employed materials. [4, 5]Herein, we report a study on P-type layered sodium transition metal-based oxides, of the composition NaxMO 2 (M=Ni, Fe, Mn), used as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries employing a 1 M NaPF 6 in propylene carbonate (PC) as electrolyte solution.
