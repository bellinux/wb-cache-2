2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist.

They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|R

25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

Harper also stated that he had told the Conservative party representatives that they were unlikely to succeed. [...] "I told them they were wasting their time. I said Chuck had made up his mind."

500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> {{are a lot of people}} who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E

He said: [...] "There {{has been a lot of}} discussion about it: 'Is this the last Iron Man for Robert ?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth Iron Man."

500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} TV Guide if he would've {{remained}} on General Hospital had the show's producers [...] "tried harder" [...] to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: [...] "I don't {{want to point}} fingers. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> {{are a lot of}} disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E
500|$|Alex Hawgood from The New York Times {{wrote that}} at first listen the song came across as another generic dance hit. Hawgood however praised the song for its hidden subtext {{intended}} to be a response to gay suicides. Hawgood compared the song to the likes of Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, all of which [...] "represent a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track [...] "infectious" [...] and praised her honesty and sincerity on the track. [...] Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose [...] "We R Who We R" [...] as a highlight on Cannibal. The Phoenix Daniel Brockman felt that the song had a [...] "lifting anthemic heft" [...] while Spins Barry Walters said that with the song, [...] "she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays." [...] Rolling Stones Will Hermes called the song [...] "awesome." [...] Steven Hyden from The A.V. Club, in the album review of Cannibal, wrote that her [...] "let’s get fucking fucked-up" [...] attitude on the track was a positive calling her [...] "a complete and utter genius." [...] Hyden reviewed the song alongside fellow editor Genevieve Koski in a separate publication, giving the song a B and a D+, respectively. Hyden reiterated his comments from the album review in his review of the song, but added that the song was sonically similar to her previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] and [...] "Take It Off", adding that on the song she [...] "seems a little more self-aware, imploring {{each and every one of}} us to start 'dancing like we’re dumb.'". On the opposite end up the spectrum, Koski was critical of the song, criticizing her vocals with his consensus being that [...] "I want to give every Kesha song an 'F' on principle, but objectively speaking, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> are far worse songs out there, so let’s average out a subjective F and an objective C+ to a D+." ...|$|E
