5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful <b>flight,</b> <b>no</b> weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{constructed}} from October 1940 onwards as a relief landing ground for RAF Hixon, the base at Wheaton Aston was completed {{six months before}} Hixon was. Instead Wheaton Aston became a satellite airfield of RAF High Ercall {{under the auspices of}} the Service Flying Training School (SFTS) at RAF Shawbury and a training base for No. 11 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU). Because of the upturn in training at the base, it eventually went on to have 5 Relief Landing Grounds/Satellite sites of its own (RAF Bratton, RAF Peplow, RAF Perton, RAF Seighford & RAF Tatenhill). Throughout its existence, RAF Wheaton Aston was parented by RAF Shawbury and was dedicated to (P)AFU and Beam Approach Training (BAT). BAT was an early form of instrument landing system using radio beams. Training units based here were No. 11 (P)AFU, No 11 SFTS, No.21 (P)AFU, No. 1511 BAT <b>Flight,</b> <b>No.</b> 1517 BAT Flight and No. 1545 BAT <b>Flight.</b> <b>No.</b> 11 (P)AFU was structured into six flights, three were based at RAF Shawbury with one each at RAF Condover, RAF Perton and Wheaton Aston.|$|E

With the aid of materials supplied by the French, the aircraft was made flyable, but when 615 Squadron received orders to relocate to Vitry-en-Artois, an attempt to fly the aircraft to the new base was unsuccessful, and a forced landing had to be made in a field. On 10 May 1940, the airfield was attacked by the Luftwaffe, with over 110 bombs being dropped, resulting in a Breguet being destroyed, another Breguet and a Potez being severely damaged and the radio facilities being temporarily put out of action.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Canada, Worsley had made the {{acquaintance}} of a young Canadian, Grettir Algarsson, who was of Icelandic descent and was preparing a ship for a voyage to the Arctic. Algarsson's voyage proved short-lived, as his ship collided with floating wreckage while in the North Sea. Undeterred, he set about preparing an expedition for the following year and invited Worsley, who had provided advice for his previous voyage, to join him. The plan was to sail to Spitzbergen, in the Arctic Circle, and Algarsson was to fly {{from there to the}} North Pole where he would crash the plane, and, with his pilot, sledge back. Worsley was to captain the ship that Algarsson had purchased for the expedition, a [...] diesel-engined brigatine called the Island. A lack of funds resulted in the cancellation of the planned flight as a suitable plane could not be found. However, the 15-man expedition, known as the Algarsson North Polar Expedition, went ahead with certain mapping and scientific objectives, among them a search for Gillis Land, northeast of Spitzbergen, which had not been sighted since 1707, as well as sounding the continental shelf between Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land. [...] With the plane <b>flight</b> <b>no</b> longer viable, and the focus of the expedition now primarily on maritime matters, Algarsson offered Worsley co-leadership of the expedition, which he accepted. The Island sailed on 21 June 1925 from Liverpool.|$|E
