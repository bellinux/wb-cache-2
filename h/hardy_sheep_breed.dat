3000|$|Farming {{businesses}} {{in these areas}} have generally limited options for farm diversification, due to their distance from urban centres and markets. Nevertheless, many receive some income from non-farming activities. Whilst upland farm businesses are noted for their resilience {{in the face of}} harsh economic and environmental conditions, they can also be particularly prone to social disadvantage, as a combined result of poor access to services (CRC 2008) and for some, poor living standards. Most of them have a very strong cultural attachment to their way of life and the traditions associated with hill farming (Defra ACEO 2009). The protection of upland farming culture, such as the traditional farming system and presence of <b>hardy</b> upland <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds,</b> is a highly emotive issue, as (Swales et al. 2004) reported in their evaluation of the uplands: [...]...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to compare sperm motion characteristics of adult Malpura and Bharat Merino rams by the computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) technique. Malpura is a <b>hardy</b> native <b>sheep</b> <b>breed</b> of the semi-arid tropical environment and Bharat Merino is a crossbred evolved in the same environment by crossing native sheep with exotic rams. Semen was collected from 8 donor rams of each breed at the onset of autumn season on 5 occasions at three days interval. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the general linear model repeated measures procedure. The CASA parameters which differed significantly (p< 0. 05) between the breeds were rapid motile sperm, medium motile sperm, slow motile sperm, linearity, straightness, curvilinear velocity, average path velocity, straight-line velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, beat frequency, sperm head area and sperm head elongation with higher values in all traits in Malpura breed. The semen volume and sperm concentration were higher in Bharat Merino breed but the differences were not significant. The body weight of rams had significant (p< 0. 05) effect on mass motility, curvilinear velocity and amplitude of lateral head displacement. The m ass motility was higher in rams of more than 50 kg body weight while curvilinear velocity and amplitude of lateral head displacement was higher in rams of less than 50 kg body weight. A significant (p< 0. 05) influence of age of rams was observed on linearity and amplitude of lateral head displacement. The linearity was higher in rams of less than 3. 5 years of age whereas amplitude of lateral head displacem ent was higher in rams of more than 3. 5 years of age. In conclusion, CASA derived sperm motion characteristics revealed that the semen quality of native Malpura rams was better compared to crossbred Bharat M erino rams during major breeding season in a sem i-arid tropical climate...|$|R

30|$|In {{this study}} the {{characterisation}} and separation/discrimination of three <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> (crosses, West African Dwarfs (WAD) and West African Long Legged (WALL)] {{based on their}} physical traits (morphological characterisation) was investigated extensively with the application of discriminant analysis. The study’s main objective was specifically based on developing a variable selection criterion that can discriminate best among the three <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> and as well as obtain a reliable mathematical function/equation (discriminant functions) for provision of maximum separation among the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> Data from College of Education, Mampong animal farms on various <b>breeds</b> of <b>sheep</b> (hybrid/crossed <b>breed,</b> Sahell/WALL and Djallonke/WAD) was used. Factor Analysis was employed as a variable selection criterion for selecting six sheep traits that can discriminate best among the <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> Canonical discriminant function was derived for the eight variable data set and was compared with the derived quadratic discriminant functions (QDFs) using the six extracted sheep traits. The six variable QDF distance classifier provided maximum separation after cross validation than the 8 -variable canonical discriminant functions. The derived mathematical functions (QDFs) were able to provide maximum separation among the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> with a correct classification rate of 0.86.|$|R

30|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} a separator/discriminating function for separating the three known <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> (hybrid/crosses, WAD and WALL <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds).</b> The derived discriminant functions provided maximum (canonical linear discriminant function) separation among the three known breeds with an overall classification rate of 78.9  %. However, factor analysis extracted six (6) traits out of the eight variables and the derived discriminant functions with the six variables provided better separation than the eight variate discriminant equation (Canonical discriminant function). Quadratic discriminant functions were derived from the six variate data and 86.2  % correct classification of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> were achieved. The study can therefore conclude that <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> can be clearly separated based on the physical traits with minimum rate of misclassification without concentrating on only their genotypic features.|$|R

This research aims to study of utilizing behaviour characteristic variables to differentiate and estimate genetic distance between the <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> The study was conducted at Cilebut and Bogor Animal House of Indonesian Research Institute for Animal Production. Five <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> used were Barbados Black Belly Cross (BC), Garut Composite (KG), Garut Local (LG), Sumatera Composite (KS) and St. Croix Cross (SC), with total sample of 50 heads. A total of 10 variables of behavior traits were observed in this study. Analysis of variances and significance tests were applied to compare between <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> and performed for all of behavior traits using PROC GLM of SAS Program ver. 9. 0. PROC CANDISC was used for canonical discriminant analyses, the hierarchical clustering was performed using the PROC CLUSTER by Average Linkage method (Unweighted Pair-Group Method Using Arithmetic Averages, UPGMA), and the dendogram for the five <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> was described using PROC TREE. The differentiator variables for the behavior traits were standing and feeding duration. The canonical plotting based on behavioral characteristics could differentiate BC, KS and LG (with KG and SC) sheeps.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to estimate genetic distance, the phylogenetic relationship, and time of divergences using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Materials and Methods: The total 216 unrelated samples were collected from native breeding tract of six Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> The genomic DNA was isolated and screened for restriction enzyme polymorphisms for cytochrome b (Cyt-b) region of mtDNA with seven restriction enzymes. Results: The genetic distance among <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> was ranging between 0. 02833 and 0. 0946. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malpura and Chokla were found closer relationship forming distinct cluster followed by Deccani individual were clustered with Nellore sheep, whereas Nali and Sonadi were distant to each other having separate cluster. Estimated divergence time among Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds</b> were ranging about 1. 41 - 4. 73 million years ago (MYA) with an average of 3. 063 ± 0. 27 MYA.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the restriction fragment length polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) of the Cyt-b region of mtDNA is suitable and cost effective tool for estimating the genetic variability, phylogenetic relationship, and time of divergence among Indian <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds.</b> These findings will help to formulate proper breeding strategies for conservation and utilization of <b>sheep</b> <b>breeds...</b>|$|R
