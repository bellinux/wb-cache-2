25|$|By 2005 NorskeCanada had {{operated}} with {{a deficit}} in 13 of 19 quarters, and Norske Skog started considering its {{options for the}} company.

The paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs. The first step was taken in October 2005, when the general meeting approved the new name, Catalyst Paper, to signal that the group was leaving Norske Skog. The Norwegian group sold its 29.4 percent of Catalyst for $186 million in a bought deal on 30 January 2006. At the time Catalyst's four mills made it North America's fourth-largest producer of printing papers, with an annual production of two million tonnes of paper and half a million tonnes of <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} a {{comprehensive}} study of the properties of extracted Eucalyptus globulus <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps.</b> Five levels of hot water extraction were performed, each followed by kraft cooking to three different kappa numbers.

Fiber length decreased for all pulps and kink index increased greatly with extraction. The dispersive components of the surface energy for the control (unextracted) and extracted (120 min) kappa no. 15 <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps,</b> as determined by inverse gas chromatography, {{were found to be}} 30. 8 and 34. 9 mJ/m 2, respectively.
