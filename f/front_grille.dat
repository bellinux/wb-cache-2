25|$|In 1967, {{the first}} Range Rover {{prototype}} was built (number plate SYE 157F), with the classic Range Rover shape discernible, {{but with a}} different <b>front</b> <b>grille</b> and headlight configuration. The design of the Range Rover was finalised in 1969. Twenty-six Velar engineering development vehicles were built between 1969 and 1970 and were road registered with the number plates YVB151H through to YVB177H.|$|E
25|$|Whistling {{telephone}} wires, automobile radio antennae, certain automobile <b>front</b> <b>grilles,</b> {{and smoke}} stacks are {{other examples of}} this tone. At very low Reynolds numbers, the flow around a cylinder is stable, forming two fixed vortices behind it. As the speed increases, the flow, although laminar, becomes unstable and vortices are shed alternately.|$|R
50|$|Some of GM's most {{successful}} {{products in the}} muscle car era were A-body models, including the Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Malibu SS, Oldsmobile 442 and Buick GS.

25|$|The <b>front</b> <b>grille</b> of {{a vehicle}} is used to direct air {{directly}} into the engine compartment. In a streamlined design the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the grille {{of a vehicle}} redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a grille block is often used. A grille block covers up a portion, or {{the entirety of the}} <b>front</b> <b>grille</b> of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or vehicles with low drag coefficients there will be a very small grille already built into the design, therefore a grille block is unneeded. The grille in most production vehicles is built generally to have as much air flowing into the engine compartment in order to keep it from overheating. But most commonly there is too much airflow into the engine compartment, preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, so a grille block is used to increase engine performance and reduce the vehicle's drag.|$|E
25|$|The Dacia {{designers}} {{wanted to}} give a new look for the Dacia models and the front side comes with several new features. The front and back bumpers have been slightly redesigned and the headlights have a new design that includes LED day running lights (it {{is the first time}} that Dacia models offer LED lights).The aesthetic package is completed by a new <b>front</b> <b>grille,</b> similar to the one found on the Duster.|$|E

25|$|The first-generation SC lasted in {{production}} until 7 July 2000, over nine years, quite long {{compared to the}} other cars of the 1990s. Even with the SC's long production cycle, only minor exterior changes were made. New tail lighting and a modified spoiler design was part of the mid-cycle vehicle refresh. A <b>front</b> <b>grille</b> was added in 1996, along with a redesigned front bumper, side skirts and rocker panels. The SC 400 produced / from 1991 to 1995.

25|$|Some of the company's first promotional {{vehicles}} appeared {{about the}} same time as the museum pieces, and though they were not brass era, they were yet molded in plastic. One model was the Audi 100 sedan, the real car being one of the first Audis to be exported to the United States around 1969. This model was slightly larger than 1:43 scale, in a silver box with black lettering. The car was well detailed in styrene plastic, especially the <b>front</b> <b>grille</b> and also the floorpan and engine features on the plastic chassis. This model may have been one of the first promotionals offered by Cursor, and perhaps somewhat rare, because it is not mentioned in Force's (1990) book.|$|E
