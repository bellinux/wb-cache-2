40|$|The {{birth of}} an infant with a {{disability}} is often perceived as {{the loss of a}} “perfect” baby and is typically an unanticipated event for the mother and family.

2500|$|For Dewey and his {{philosophical}} followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners {{are taught}} {{that knowledge is}} transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. [...] Dewey not only re-imagined {{the way that the}} learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. [...] For Dewey, “The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education” (Dewey, 1904, p.18). [...] Dewey’s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher <b>educators</b> <b>can</b> begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.|$|E

40|$|Education is {{not just}} a part of {{diabetes}} treatment; it is the treatment. This article will briefly review the goals and targets of a diabetes educator and how diabetes education has helped {{to improve the lives of}} diabetic patients. The key aims of diabetes education are to change behavior and promote self-management. Diabetes education consists of providing tools and support to patients as they learn to manage their disease thereby creating self confidence. Educating and imparting knowledge to diabetic patients is a complicated process. Individuals affected by diabetes must learn self-management skills and make life style changes to effectively manage diabetes and avoid or delay the complications associated with this disorder. For these reasons, self-management education is corner stone of treatment for all people with diabetes. Diabetes education has had somewhat impressive results in reducing the frequency of certain chronic diabetic complications in high-risks groups, notably foot ulceration and amputation. To deal with the great challenge of the global increase in diabetes prevalence, a diabetes education team has to intervene. A diabetes <b>educator</b> <b>can</b> provide support by encouraging patients to talk about their concerns or fears about diabetes.
