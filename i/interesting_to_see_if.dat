40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two innovations to geophysical inversion. The first {{provides a}} framework and an algorithm for combining linear deconvolution methods with geo-statistical interpolation techniques.

Most cultures establish norms, and also provide occasional opportunities for transgression of these norms. Breaking the rules, and understanding that rules are being broken is necessary to test the limits and the boundaries of acceptable behavior. Games provide us with an arena in which such trangressions can take place safely. Current videogames, however, provide these transgressive opportunities primarily for white males.

By studying these microbial changes and correlating them with other changes in the bird&# 039;s biology we aim to define important host-microbe interactions. Using the latest high throughput DNA sequencing methods to characterize microbial populations we have found that the differential abundance of some bacterial species correlates with differences seen in the feed conversion ratios of individual birds, indicating that there are microbes present that may positively or adversely affect bird productivity. We are now investigating these <b>interesting</b> bacterial species <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> manipulation of their numbers can affect productivity outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Before {{we turn to}} the {{analysis}} and results of the final study, we should also mention that we excluded three further questionnaire studies. One was conducted in Patras, Greece, among 19 philosophy students whose answers were amazingly close to those of the students in Athens reported in the next section. Then we excluded the findings among 27 students who study journalism in Madrid (Carlos III). These students “disliked” the proportional rule as much as the students in Athens but had, in contrast to Athens, a very strong preference for the first of the two progressive schemes. We decided to exclude these groups for two reasons. One was the relatively low sample size in each case; the second and more important reason {{was the fact that the}} fields of study of these respondents are very different from economics and business administration. In further investigations, it would, of course, be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how, <b>if</b> at all, students from different backgrounds differ in their evaluations. Finally, we decided to exclude very recent findings from Barcelona (Universitat Autònoma). These were done in May 2015 while all the other studies were run between October and December of 2014. For Barcelona, we have results from first year (n= 52) and third year (n= 33) students in business administration. Both groups hardly chose the proportional rule. While the first year students clearly preferred the more progressive scheme to the less progressive version, the third year students just stated the opposite preference, also distinctly. This is another aspect within the context of burden sharing worth exploring in future research.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} imaging {{observations}} of comets 73 P-B/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 and 73 P-C/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 at the IRTF with SpeX (J, K) and MRSI (10 micron narrow band filter set) on 2006 Apr 17 - 19 UT and 2006 Jun 18 - 19, {{and at the}} VLT with VISIR (1 0 micron narrow band filters, 20 micron) on 2006 Apr 17 UT. Compared to when the comet {{was in the midst}} of breaking up in mid-April, in June the tail of 73 P-B is much fainter and there is a compact coma detected well separated and ahead of its tail, and fainter than the tail. The width of the tail in J, K, and 10 micron images indicates that the pieces that were shed in April must still be outgassing and releasing small particles into the tail-shaped coma; small grains have relatively short lifetimes in the coma due to radiation pressure. The trailing tail is now well separated from the faint "leader of the pack" compact coma that we suppose is a remaining piece of the nucleus. It will be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> post-perihelion <b>if</b> this "leading compact coma" object continues to gain distance on the debris and continues to weakly outgas and shed small grains. One wonders if it expended its volatiles (available to the surface) in breaking up; a short-lived release of volatiles occurred in the Deep Impact event with comet 9 P/Tempel 1. 73 P-C is extended with a more elongated coma structure closer to perihelion compared to 2006 Apr 18 - 19 UT. The SEDs from 2006 Apr and Jun from SpeX-MIRSI (IRTF) are compared with VISIR (VLT) SEDs from 2006 Apr. Information on the heliocentric dependence of the activity and dust release yields insights into the origin of activity and the relationship between activity and grain size distribution/mineralogy...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} findings with regards to what was found is that which deals with the farming aspect of this culture. This village, and others like it, replaced Roman farms after the imperial administration left Britain. The Anglo-Saxons settled in small villages that were generally self-sustaining. Within these self-sustaining communities there is evidence that these peoples were more likely to provide for themselves through a farming lifestyle than a foraging one. Within the archaeological remains there were more domesticated animal species found than wild animal species, which also suggests that this group were less dependent on hunting as a means of survival, and supports the idea that they were farmers.The settlers in this area were thought to be from a different area, with German descent being the most likely area, and as such it is interesting to see what farming techniques may be employed by this group. Since the landscapes are quite different, it would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the newly settled group would use a German style of farming in this new terrain. This area helps to provide some insight into these farming adaptations. Within animal husbandry, however, this group was more likely to use elements found within the native system of the country.|$|E

For our research, we have studied the benefits that may attract students to either note taking method, as well as, researched the cons that may cause students to reject adopting either of the two. Finally, we discuss where note taking may be headed in the future. The answer matters to us because through our research we have been able to come across several studies in which discuss the benefits on digital devices in the classroom.

It is shown that a simple nonlinear operation of weighting and thresholding wavelet coefficients can consistently outperform classical linear inverse methods in terms of mean-square error across a broad range of noise magnitude in the data. Wavelets allow for an adaptively smoothed solution: smoothed more in uninteresting regions, less at geologically important transitions. (cont.) A third issue is also addressed, somewhat separate from the first two: the correct manipulation of discrete geophysical data. The theory of fractional splines is introduced, which allows for optimal approximation of real signals on a digital computer. Using splines, it can be shown that a linear operation on the spline can be equivalently represented by a matrix operating on the coefficients of a certain spline basis function. The form of the matrix, however, depends completely on the spline basis, and incorrect discretization of the operator into a matrix can lead to large errors in the resulting matrix/vector product. by Jonathan A.

40|$|Background and {{research}} question: There are several manners to control employees {{and ensure that}} they perform in accordance to the company’s objectives. This is obtained {{by the use of}} management control systems. One of the controls measures available is reward systems. In knowledge-intensive companies, the employees constitute the primary asset for competition. This inspired the following question: How can a knowledge-intensive, consultancy company remunerate and evaluate the consultants’ performances and does it contribute to knowledge development and retaining high-performing employees? Purpose: This thesis will give an idea to how a reward system was designed and how this system affects the employees’ willingness to stay within the organisation. Furthermore, show how to perform evaluations and how to endorse knowledge development. Limitations: Concentrating the thesis on one company to keep data collecting feasible and study a company that the authors knew tried to keep their high performers on a long-term. Methodology: The thesis has used a qualitative approach to better understand and interpret the respondents’ answers. Three respondents gave their opinion on the case company’s remuneration programme in semi-structured interviews since the authors wanted to hear their own thoughts regarding the programme. Analysis and conclusion: Several types of rewards exist in the company, albeit only two main rewards are frequently used. The use of a clear career model, which informs the employees of possible paths to take and expectations to reach them, is very important as a motivating influence. Employees who have the necessary qualifications and perform well are paid and promoted quickly if their evaluations express potential. However, these evaluations take much time and effort to complete and the outcome is subjective. Suggestion for further studies: There are several approaches possible towards reward systems. Since this study displayed the rewarding influence of a career model on employees, a future study regarding the behavioural effects of a career model on employees would be highly <b>interesting.</b> <b>Interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> would be <b>if</b> the use of an “Up or Out” policy attract certain types of people. Since this was a case study of one company, it would be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> study if other companies within the business handle this issue of rewards in another way...|$|R

La idea que es presenta i que motiva l’experiència es el fet d’explorar una nova manera de desenvolupar el projecte fi de carrera per als estudiants d’Enginyeria. Aquests projectes han d’obeir a les mateixes característiques que un projecte industrial real en el sentit de desenvolupar un “producte” que ha de funcionar. El SAF proporciona el marc ideal per a desenvolupar treballs d’aquest tipus dintre de l’àrea temàtica de l’automatització de sistemes. En la realització del projecte o problema a resoldre s’identifiquen diferents rols o paper en similitud als que l’estudiant s’acabarà trobant a la vida real. D’aquesta manera es promou la interacció entre els diferents grups i es motiva a que l’estudiant assumeixi les tasques associades al seu paper dintre del projecte global. D’aquesta manera, hi ha, per una banda, el client final del producte (que en el nostre cas es el SAF mateix) per al qual uns desenvolupadors han de dur a terme la tasca encomanda per tal de solucionar el problema presentat (aquest problema es presentat i detallat directament per el client en base a reunions). A més, s’identifica una tasca d’assessoria que, de manera intencionada, associem a estudiants de l’altra universitat i que hauran d’avaluar les tasques desenvolupades, emetre un judici i suggerir possibles vies de millora. Això obliga a presentar tan al client com al desenvolupador les seves conclusions, argumentar les decisions, etc Creiem que l’experiència es prou interessant com per veure si es extensible a altres dominis que nos siguin els purament tecnològics. This communication {{presents a}} collaborative experience among the superior technical college of Engineering (ETSE), {{the service of}} Physical Activity (SAF) of the UAB together with the Polytechnic School of Catalonia located in Vilanova i la Geltrú (EPSVG). The idea that is being introduced and that motivates the experience is the fact of exploring {{a new way to}} develop the final year project for the students of Engineering. These projects have to be due to the same characteristics than a real industrial project in the sense of developing a "product" that has to work. The SAF provides the ideal frame to develop works of this type in the thematic area of systems automation. In the realization of the project or problem to be solved they identify different roles in similarity to those that the student will end up finding itself in the real life real. In this way the interaction is promoted among the different groups and is motivated to the student assuming the tasks associated with its role in the global project. In this way, there is the final customer of the product, on the one hand (that in our case is played by the SAF) for which some developers have to carry out the associated task in order to solve the presented problem (this problem is presented and detailled directly by the customer with regard to meetings). Moreover, a consultancy task is identified such that, in an intentional way, we associate with students of another university and that will have to evaluate the developed tasks, that will have to issue a judgement and that will have to suggest possible ways of improvement. This forces to presenting to the customer {{as well as to the}} developer its conclusions, to argue the decisions, etc We believe that the experience is <b>interesting</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> it could be extended to other domains than the purely technological ones...|$|R
