The methodology includes aspects common to both ISSs that have a well documented text-based save format and those that do not, as well as aspects that are unique to each type. We will also describe the means by which an <b>external</b> <b>translator</b> can be integrated into a translator framework. Finally, we will describe how an internal translator can be integrated directly into the ISS...|$|E
40|$|Presented thesis {{deals with}} design and {{implementation}} of an information system for a local translation agency. The main purpose of the information system is to provide functions for effective user/project management. Key part of system is represented by a multi-level processing of terminology queries from <b>external</b> <b>translators.</b> Further features include distribution of documents to users, resource planning, and work evaluation. In order to provide instant 24 / 7 access, the system has been implemented as a WWW application using PHP script language, MySQL database, and AJAX technology...|$|R
30|$|The {{translation}} of complex visions from seven national languages into English and the {{translation of}} English recommendations backwards into national languages must inevitably lead to some losses, because translations {{were made by the}} national consortium members, who were research professionals and not translators. Brandstetter et al. (2011) found that some experts, as well as citizens, were negatively surprised by the poor quality of language used in some of the visions and recommendations, respectively. Overall, the language translation was a minor problem, and losses due to this process were kept to a minimum, but this matter could be addressed in future applications of transnational CIVISTI processes by hiring <b>external</b> <b>translators.</b> The trade-off between more accurate translations and the decrease in efficiency of the process through additional costs would have to be explored further. Also, processes conducted at national or regional level avoid this problem, by making translations dispensable.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{software}} development {{is expected to}} be both flexible and efficient despite continuously increasing project complexity. Partly in response to these requirements, agile {{software development}} models have become more and more popular. The integration of localization in agile software development, however, leads to a number of conflicts. Translation work is expensive and time-consuming. Usually, neither qualified native nor second-language speakers are available to assist or test during development. The localization efforts are outsourced to <b>external</b> <b>translators.</b> As a consequence, a number of important questions arise: How can linguistic and cultural knowledge be communicated for consideration in agile development? How can the need for deadlines be aligned with a desire for agility? How can external dependencies such as translators be integrated seamlessly? In this poster, we explore these issues and questions. In order to hint at the wide range of possible issues, a sample of common localization problems are shown and the challenges of dealing with them during agile development are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Universities {{increasingly}} {{compete for}} students across borders producing English-language {{versions of a}} wide range of materials, including promotional web pages and brochures, press releases, study guides and regulations. In addition, online transactions between universities and international students increasingly take place in both the national language and English. One way to improve a university’s international profile is to support staff members as well as in-house or <b>external</b> <b>translators</b> with dedicated tools such as bilingual databases for the relevant subject fields and translation dictionaries that take the text (and not just terms) as the central unit of translation. The paper reports on the start of a project aimed a creating an online multilingual dictionaries for drafters and translators of university texts. More specifically, the paper looks at the following: (I) preparation of specific user profiles; (ii) identification of subject fields and selection and preparation of corpus data; (iii) design of a related termbase (iii) term extraction and data retrieval (for collocations and texts); (iv) layout and design of the lexicographic tool...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years, {{research}} on language diversity and multilingualism in international business (IB) and international management has been burgeoning. Language {{has moved from}} being the ‘pariah’ of the 70 s and 80 s to a key area of concern for businesses that have become {{acutely aware of the}} significance of ‘efficient’ communication for the global marker. Companies have adopted a range of strategies in order to manage the growing diversity of languages. To this end, they have introduced one-language policies (typically but not always English), recruited speakers with ‘native competence’ in target languages, or they have started to work with <b>external</b> or internal <b>translators</b> or interpreters as well as other stakeholders in local networks. What is understood as ‘efficient’ in that context however and how much language strategies contribute to that effect is still open to debate...|$|R
40|$|Wei (2007) {{claims that}} natural bilinguals have {{difficulty}} translating. This paper explores {{the reasons for}} this difficulty by comparing the demands placed on translators with the day-today experiences of being bilingual. According to Romaine (1989) and De Bot (1992), bilinguals are not typically required to keep their speech free of influence from other languages they speak, and can mix elements from various languages unconsciously. Like monolinguals, bilinguals produce their language automatically, as described by Levelt (1989). Translators, however, work for an audience that has a low tolerance for deviations from the monolingual norm. This <b>external</b> pressure causes <b>translators</b> to monitor their speech production more closely, which they are able to do because translation does not require speech to be produced in real time. The present work covers translation, not interpretation - work with written texts, not speech. Taking examples of translations and mistranslations from Russian, Chinese, and English, I will outline the forms of interference often faced by translators in terms of morpho syntactic structure and lexical items. By choosing translation examples that are as unambiguous as possible, I will intentionally avoid many of the traditional concerns of translation theory, such as audience and authorial intent. Functional structures from Lexical-Functional Grammar are provided for sentential examples to illustrate in a formal, organized way how a good translation keeps meaning and grammatical relations constant and faithful during the transfer from one language to another. The conclusions of this paper will aid aspiring translators in understanding the demands of translation and any [...] 1 necessary trammg...|$|R
