In order to survive, organizations need to introduce new products in the marketplace drastically. In view of that, understanding critical success factors (CSFs) that contribute to successfully implementing pre-development is becoming more important. However, {{most of the past}} studies were conducted in large organizations; very little has been done in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have certain limitations in terms of their financial, human, and technical resources that could hinder their progress towards implementing the pre-development. This paper reviews and analyses CSFs developed by previous authors in order to propose a set of CSFs, which were thought to be critical <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Besides, pre-testing with pre-development experts and SMEs practitioners, the questionnaire was also validated through a pilot study with fifty five SMEs. The questionnaire was designed comprising three compulsory activities of pre-development and CSFs for successful pre-development implementation. The final form of the questionnaire consists of twenty five items of pre-development activities within four constructs, and thirty six items of CSFs within nine constructs. Through systematic identification and validation, it is hoped that the set of CSFs could be used as <b>guides</b> <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> to implement the pre-development process successfully...|$|R

40|$|North Carolina is {{challenged}} to foster economic development while protecting environmental assets under regulatory and legislative mandate. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) {{are the major}} economic drivers in North Carolina, and in the United States as a whole, but existing support networks for small emterprises looking to pursue sustainable practices are insufficient. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to ensure that its regulations do not unreasonably burden SMEs. The EPA is investigating ways that it can assist SMEs that are voluntarily trying to improve their environmental stewardship, specifically looking at the feasibility and appropriateness of using environmental management systems (EMSs) and peer-to-peer mentoring to help small businesses address their corporate practices. This report provides {{the results of the}} first phase of work for the EPA. Analysis of qualitative data from SMEs in two North Carolina cities shows that barriers and motivations for sustainable behavior in small organizations are different than those for larger entities. Our analysis and recommendations for tools to help SMEs improve their environmental footprints were aided by identifying and analyzing the motivations that <b>SMEs</b> cite <b>for</b> implementing sustainable practices. SMEs need a simple and flexible framework for developing and implementing EMSs. Introducing SMEs to the newly-developed “EMS <b>Guide</b> <b>for</b> SME” tool may help smaller enterprises at different level of EMS potential incorporate an informal environmental management system into their daily business operations. The EMS <b>Guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>SME</b> separates SMEs into three categories based on their EMS development potential and provides specific guidance for entities across the potential range. This will help organizations customize their environmental analysis and procedures to fit their capabilities, as well as identify areas for future development and continuous improvement. Mentoring is another feasible and appropriate strategy to help SMEs achieve sustainability goals. Based on comments from respondents and literature review, initial recommendations for the structure of a mentoring program were developed. These recommendations will be incorporated into the next phase of the EPA research – establishing a peer-to-peer network in North Carolina for small businesses interested in sustainability...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years, many {{national}} standard setters have introduced differential reporting for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Internationally, SMEs are a diverse and dynamic group which are described under broad characteristics in different countries. SMEs are not issuers or public sector entities and therefore frequently the qualitative criteria of not being publicly accountable may define these entities. Acceptance and imposition of International Accounting Standards (IASs) has reignited the debate on differential reporting, especially since the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a discussion document in June 2004 on SME reporting. It is apparent the majority of national standard setters support an IASB-generated alternative reporting regime <b>for</b> <b>SMEs,</b> citing that IFRS developed specifically for listed entities are not relevant <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> Benefits would include lower compliance costs for reporters who would face reduced disclosure due to simplified presentation. This would encourage continuing compliance to the IAS regime thus benefiting users when SMEs produce comparable financial information. It is {{the objective of this}} paper to provide a review of the diversity in jurisdictional approaches to resolve these issues. This includes a discussion of the two approaches: the ‘top-down’ or the ‘bottom-up’ approach, with examples of each. This research has been motivated by the absence in academic literature of sufficient studies examining the underlying issues fundamental to redefining the balance between the accountability and decision-usefulness functions of general purpose financial reporting. To achieve this objective, this paper considers relevant academic and practitioner literature before undertaking an analysis of the issues this literature raises. Unique SME factors, including close-knit agency relationships, and a tendency to aim for survival and stability over profit maximisation and growth suggest a distinctly different focus to the IASB conceptual framework is required. The prevalence of an unsubstantiated view that SMEs are ‘small entities on the way to becoming large entities’ overshadows the argument on whether and how SMEs should be offered relief from highly technical IAS. Some countries have regulation <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> already or are developing a Best Practice <b>Guide</b> <b>for</b> their <b>SMEs.</b> Exemptions may be based on a public accountability test (as in Canada), but Finland finds the Canadian example ‘too vague’ and New Zealand’s sector-neutral stance made the application of this definition too broad. The IASB may limit definition to broad qualitative and quantitative SME boundaries in its struggle to provide a useful suite of SME accounting standards to nation states. Managing different worldviews and the demands of both preparers and users who are unused to lobbying at a high level, will be challenging for the IASB. Although the IASB originally aimed for a single set of conceptually robust SME standards, they must revisit the specific stewardship focus of SME reporting to gain traction in this project. The SME debate appears as a crucible in which the resolution of such tensions may in time be resolved...|$|R

40|$|Diverse {{complications}} and controversial {{issues in the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have been reported by many jurisdictions, prompting them not to adopt this set of standards.

Analysis of variation between the hypothetical IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> 2 ̆ 7 financial statements and the original U. S.

As the individual financial statements drown up in compliance with IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> will serve <b>for</b> profit distribution under the 2 nd European Directive the question arises weather the profits determined under these accounting rules can be considered as realized for distribution purposes. In order to mitigate the mismatch between accounting and distributable profits, Member States will need to reconsider the circumstances in which gains and losses arising from re-measurement at fair value through profit and loss should be considered as realized. In this scenario, two important questions arise: What are the potential tax effects of the application of IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs?</b> Is the profit determined under IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> available <b>for</b> distribution or some adjustments are necessary?

Summary and conclusions. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has pursued a strong agenda to develop a simplified set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for small and medium-sized enterprises (<b>SMEs).</b> IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> published in 2009 was derived from full IFRS with significantly reduced recognition and measurement principles, guidance and disclosure requirements in order to satisfy the accounting information needs of the users of SME financial statements. The aim of this thesis is to undertake a comprehensive examination of the conceptual and practical issues in the convergence of IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> and suggest possible ways to address these issues. In particular, the thesis undertakes the following four research projects under the theme of problems and challenges in implementing IFRS for SMEs: (1) critically reviews IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs,</b> including the development and implementation process of the standards; (2) examines whether accountants are able to distinguish between the recognition and measurement principles of full IFRS and IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> when they exercise professional judgment; (3) investigates the impact of the reduced guidance in IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> on the professional judgment of accountants; and (4) investigates whether users of SME financial statements benefit from a simplified set of IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> This thesis employs exploratory and empirical research methods to examine the controversial issues in {{the adoption of}} IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> The findings of this thesis provide evidence that IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> have been a challenge for non-publicly accountable entities to adopt and there are several conceptual and practical issues with IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> In particular, the thesis provides evidence that accountants are unable to choose accounting treatments that best reflect the economic substance of a transaction when the recognition and measurement requirements are different across full IFRS and IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> and when guidance is significantly reduced from IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs.</b> This thesis also provides evidence that users perceive disclosure of IFRS <b>for</b> <b>SMEs</b> to be decision useful but they do not regard that the simplification significantly enhances their decision making.
