5|$|In , a boy {{falls in}} love from afar with a girl {{taking care of her}} elderly father. After she fails to appear with her father one day, he finds her dressed in {{mourning}} clothes with a smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> burning the basket she kept with her.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair {{repeat the process}} several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress while {{standing}} on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> she and her backup dancers are particularly shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just {{the center of the}} screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E
60|$|Lucy covered <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> hands, <b>and</b> the tears, {{in spite}} of her, forced their way between her fingers.|$|R
60|$|Antonia turned <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away, <b>and</b> {{something}} in her attitude alarmed him.|$|R
60|$|Madeline {{sprang to}} <b>her</b> feet, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> flushed <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes ablaze.|$|R
5|$|In July 2015, the Beales are {{informed}} by DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) {{that the police}} have a new DCI dealing {{with the murder of}} Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who is making an arrest. At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on his door and Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
60|$|The colour {{faded from}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> again, <b>and</b> {{she shook her}} head sadly.|$|R
60|$|Lenore felt <b>her</b> <b>face</b> blanch; <b>and</b> that intense quiver {{within her}} {{suddenly}} stilled.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> shone, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} {{eyes were}} more brilliant still with unshed tears.|$|R
5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that}} he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on <b>her</b> <b>face)</b> <b>and</b> father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E
60|$|Her hands flew to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> again <b>and</b> {{tried to}} hide the dark blush.|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} him lightly, but <b>her</b> <b>face</b> softened <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes shone with sympathy.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{perfectly}} still--her hands clasped, {{her eyes}} set, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> white <b>and</b> stern.|$|R
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
25|$|On June 29, 2007, Marshall told Fox News that Austin {{beat her}} three times. She {{also stated that}} WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> kept her from {{revealing}} that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.|$|E
25|$|According to {{scholars}} like Tirmidhī and Ḥārith b. Hishām, however, {{all of a}} woman's body is awrah, including her face, hands, and even fingernails. There is a dispensation though that allows a woman to expose <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands, e.g. when asking for her hand in marriage, {{because it is the}} centre of beauty.|$|E
60|$|Turning to Helena, {{he found}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> white <b>and</b> shining as the empty moon.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{sketching}} on the table-cloth, with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> clouded <b>and</b> set, and was silent.|$|R
60|$|She stopped {{screaming}} <b>and</b> lay there, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> twitching, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{bright with}} terror.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Cupid's wound has healed into a scar, and he escapes his mother's {{house by}} flying out a window. When he finds Psyche, he draws the sleep from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> replaces {{it in the}} box, then pricks her with an arrow that does no harm. He lifts her into the air, and takes her to present the box to Venus.|$|E
25|$|At the rehearsal, Anna Del Serre declaimed {{these lines}} with such passion, that Ronzi Di Begnis took {{them as a}} {{personal}} insult and rushed at Del Serre, pulling her hair, punching her, biting her and hitting her on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> breast. Del Serre returned in kind, but the soprano {{got the better of}} her rival, and Del Serre was carried fainting from the theatre.|$|E
25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period. There were freckles on the backs of her shoulders and acne on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> chest.|$|E
60|$|Austen looked quizzically into <b>her</b> upturned <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> {{she dropped}} <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|Gertrude sat {{silent for}} a few moments, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> drawn <b>and</b> colorless. Then she looked up.|$|R
60|$|She lifted <b>her</b> flushed <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> once {{looked him}} {{steadily}} in the eyes.|$|R
25|$|Detailed {{scholarly}} {{attention has}} focused on prescribing female dress in conformity with hijab. The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) hold that the entire body of the woman, except <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands– though a few clerics say face, hands– must be covered during prayer and in public settings (see Awrah). There are those who allow the feet to be uncovered {{as well as the}} hands and face.|$|E
25|$|Both {{wild and}} feral pigs are {{commonly}} hunted. Some breeds of pig, {{such as the}} Asian pot-bellied pig, are kept as pets. There are two instances in the 2000s where farm hogs ate human beings. The first was in 2004 in Romania, where a woman died after her ears, half of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> her fingers were consumed; the other in 2012 in Oregon—whether the farmer was killed by his hogs or died of another cause before being consumed is unknown.|$|E
25|$|After a while Frotho {{was killed}} through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho's son Ingild (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad {{so much that}} he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad {{appeared}} in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.|$|E
60|$|Martin looked {{with admiration}} on <b>her</b> glowing <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> pressed {{his lips to}} hers.|$|R
5000|$|Margarete {{appears to}} have {{initially}} been taken aback, then <b>her</b> <b>face</b> softens <b>and</b> she murmurs [...] "Poor children!" ...|$|R
60|$|Constance turned <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> smiling <b>and</b> {{flushed with}} {{pleasure}} at the words; their eyes met, then their hands.|$|R
