5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him.

She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E

25|$|In Chapter 100, Sima Yi warns Cao Zhen that Shu forces will, {{within the}} next ten days, launch an attack on Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), a {{strategic}} location which would allow further incursions into the Wei heartland. After Cao Zhen refuses to believe Sima Yi, the two make a bet {{and each of them}} leads half of the Wei army to guard the valleys to the east and west of Mount Qi. Cao Zhen prepares for battle halfheartedly as he thinks that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Seven days later, when his scouts report that a small number of Shu soldiers are approaching the valley, Cao Zhen sends his subordinate Qin Liang (秦良) to lead 5,000 men to survey the terrain. As Qin Liang and his men travel deeper into the valley, they fall into an ambush by Shu forces led by Liao Hua and Guan Xing and are completely destroyed. The Shu forces then disguise themselves by wearing the Wei soldiers' armour and uniform and infiltrate Cao Zhen's camp. In the meantime, Sima Yi encounters and defeats Shu forces led by Wei Yan. When he learns that no enemy forces have been spotted at Cao Zhen's side, he immediately leads his troops to Cao Zhen's camp. By then, the Shu infiltrators have launched a surprise attack within Cao Zhen's camp. Sima Yi shows up in time, drives back the Shu forces, and saves Cao Zhen. Cao Zhen feels so ashamed of himself that he falls sick. Zhuge Liang writes a letter to Cao Zhen to taunt and insult him. Cao Zhen becomes so angry after reading the letter that he coughs blood and dies that night in his camp. Sima Yi sends his dead body back to Luoyang, where he receives a proper burial.|$|E
500|$|In about 1795 the British {{composer}} Samuel Arnold {{produced an}} edition based on early copies; this edition, while it contains errors and inaccuracies, {{has been called}} [...] "probably a reasonable reflection of early performances". The Chrysander edition of 1874 {{has a tendency to}} [...] "sweep Arnold aside when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and follow him when he is wrong." [...] Musicologist Anthony Hicks calls it [...] "an unfortunate attempt to reconcile the autograph text with Arnold and the wordbook, the result being a composite version of no authority." ...|$|E

[...] "That bed made Pattinson who <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> now," [...] says Reed. That’s also where Hardwicke auditioned Evan Rachel Wood, when she had her get into her bed with Nikki Reed for the film Thirteen. When asked about her lair, Hardwicke says, [...] "MTV came and did an episode in my house filming the bed. It’s legendary." [...] Principal {{photography}} took 44 days, after more than a week of rehearsals, and completed on May 2, 2008. Similar to her directorial debut Thirteen, Hardwicke opted for an extensive use of hand-held cinematography to make the film [...] "feel real". Meyer visited the production set three times and was consulted on different aspects of the story; she also has a brief cameo in the film. Cast members who portrayed vampires avoided sunlight to make their skin pale, though makeup was also applied for that effect, and wore contact lenses: [...] "We did the golden color because the Cullens have those golden eyes. And then, when we're hungry, we have to pop the black ones in," [...] Facinelli explained. They also participated in rehearsals with a dance choreographer and observed the physicality of different panthera to make their bodily movements more elegant.|$|E

2500|$|P. P. Carp was {{an outspoken}} critic of generic intolerance, seeing it as the enemy of civic values. Speaking in 1892, he theorized: [...] "Culturally speaking, the first sign of a {{backward}} state is intolerance. When somebody thinks that only <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> that there is nothing outside his brain and absolutely nothing in social life, he is an uncultured being, who never had a chance of knowing how varied, how many, there are manifestations of human thinking." [...] As Carp noted, the natural breakdown of [...] "forms without content", and the disruption of traditional lifestyles, had made it tempting for regular Romanians, and for crowd-pleasing orators, to use the Jew as a scapegoat. Carp's political isolation was only increased by such discourse. According to Virgil Nemoianu, Carp was his usual [...] "trenchant" [...] speaker on this subject as well. Historian Armin Heinen notes that, with the minor socialist movement and, at times, Maiorescu, Carp was {{one of the very few}} to demand collective Jewish emancipation in the final quarter of the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Mortimer J. Adler {{wrote the}} {{following}} about Kierkegaard in 1962: [...] For Kierkegaard, man {{is essentially an}} individual, {{not a member of}} a species or race; and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision-through subjectivity, not objectivity. Systems of thought and a dialectic such as Hegel’s are matters merely of thought, which cannot comprise individual existence and decision. Such systems leave out, said Kierkegaard, the unique and essential “spermatic point, the individual, ethically and religiously conceived, and existentially accentuated.” Similarly in the works of the American author Henry David Thoureau, writing {{at the same time as}} Kierkegaard, there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility, who, when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state, government, and a united public opinion, when they are wrong. The solitary individual with right on his side is always “a majority of one.” Ethics, the study of moral values, by Mortimer J. Adler and Seymour Cain.

2500|$|... "In most conflicts, {{each party}} is certain <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> {{and the other}} wrong. And in the reality he lives in, this is {{genuinely}} the case. But in order to solve a conflict like ours, {{it is necessary to}} step into the reality of the 'other' – to see the world and events from his subjective perspective so that we can reconcile his reality with our own and merge these opposing versions of events into a bigger holistic truth inclusive enough to encompass both ostensibly rival truths. These subjective perceptions of reality constitute unique 'movies' in which we are each the protagonist. And any genuine approach to Israeli–Palestinian peace requires us to recognize the completely separate broader movies our two peoples each collectively live in. Both have experienced the past hundred years very differently and the major obstacle to attaining peace has almost nothing to do with territory but rather the inability on both sides to acknowledge, understand or accept the narrative of the 'other' without defensively feeling our own narratives threatened. I define the term 'narrative' here as a version of reality – a story told about a chain of events that organizes facts while being influenced by ideology. The same chain of events can be organized into many narratives, especially if influenced by different ideologies. The separate movies we live in very much impact how we relate to history, to ourselves and to each other in this country. Both sides tend to approach the conflict as a zero-sum game where there can only be one winner. And the conflict continues to rage partially because many of us are so trapped within our narrow paradigms that we refuse to acknowledge how things may look from different perspectives. Advocates on both sides often cite hard facts to support their positions. And while these facts might be true, they are not the only facts. And how we select, connect, contextualize and understand them is very much determined by the movies we live in. ... There is so much blame and pain powering this conflict. And acknowledging the narrative of the 'other' often feels like betraying our own. But if we can learn to see the greater movie comprising both our smaller movies and define the core aspirations and grievances of each side, we can begin to chart a course that allows both peoples to be protagonists in a single story that successfully transcends the dualistic 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and enables us all to experience the fulfillment of our deepest yearnings." ...|$|E
