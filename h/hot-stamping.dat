The yield strength of <b>hot-stamped</b> steel sheet is lower than that of water-quenched steel sheet. The microstructure of <b>hot-stamped</b> low-carbon steel sheet comprises lath martensite and retained austenite. Due to the slow cooling rate below the martensite start temperature, the martensite formed by hot stamping is auto-tempered. To clarify the factor dominating the yield strength of the <b>hot-stamped</b> steel, the authors herein investigated the effect of microstructures on the yield strength with heat-treated specimens at various cooling rates and heating temperatures.

40|$|Lightweight {{construction}} {{is an effective}} method of reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in the automotive industry. At the same time, crash safety specifications are constantly being tightened. High-strength steels meet both requirements. However, these steels {{are more difficult to}} form than deep drawing steels since their higher strength compromises formability, especially when using tensile strength above 1000 MPa. The cold formability of high-strength steel blanks can be improved by locally changing the microstructure in critical areas with laser radiation prior to cold forming. The laser heat treated areas exhibit up to five times increased elongation in a tensile test. Thanks to the locally modified mechanical properties of the blanks, parts can be formed without necking or cracks in critical areas. Another way to combine high strength with a good formability is <b>hot-stamping.</b> In the case of the widely used Manganese Boron Steel 22 MnB 5, the tensile strength is 1600 MPa after hot stamping. But such high strength is not desired in the whole part. Deformation zones for better crash performance and zones for joining require a more ductile material, what can be achieved by local heat treating these zones with laser radiation. In this work, material and process characteristics of laser heat treatment of four different high strength steels are investigated: CP-W® 800, Docol® 1200 and MS-W® 1200 are used for cold forming, 22 MnB 5 for <b>hot-stamping.</b> A fiber-coupled 10 kW high-power diode laser and optics with rectangular, homogeneous intensity distribution of up to 90 mm width are used.

Corrosion and tool friction are investigated for different coatings, to ensure automotive applicability. The laser heat treatment process is demonstrated for different parts. The properties of these parts (e. g. tensile strength, crash properties, geometry and distortion) are analyzed. B-pillars can be formed from 50 % stronger blanks than before, when using laser heat treated blanks. These B-pillars can resist higher forces in a side-impact-test.

40|$|Abstract. A {{forming process}} for heated sheet metal, such as <b>hot-stamping,</b> has limited use in {{deformable}} shapes. Higher temperature areas {{which have not}} yet {{come into contact with}} dies are more easily deformed; therefore, local deformation occurs at these areas which leads to breakage. To improve the formability of heated sheet metal, a deformation control technique utilizing the temperature dependence of flow stress is proposed. This technique can suppress local deformation by partial cooling around potential cracking areas to harden them before forming. In order to apply this technique to a variety of product shapes, a procedure to determine a suitable initial temperature distribution for deep drawing and biaxial stretching was developed with a coupled thermal-structural simulation. In this procedure, finite elements exceeding forming limit strain are highlighted, and an initial temperature distribution is defined with areas of decreased temperature around the elements to increase their resistance to deformation. Subsequently, the partial cooling technique was applied to a deep drawing test with a heated steel sheet. The results of the experiment showed that the proposed technique improved 71 % in the forming limit depth compared with results obtained using a uniform initial temperature distribution. ...|$|E

Resistance spot welding (RSW) has been the predominant welding process for automotive assemblies. Welding <b>hot-stamping</b> AHSS has introduced new challenges for achieving acceptable welds.

Simultaneous forming and quenching, {{also referred to as}} <b>hot-stamping,</b> is a manufacturing process for high strength automotive components such as side impact protection beams. A concept for integrated product and process development is proposed.

The effective-stress-function algorithm is used to update the stresses. The implemented methods are evaluated by comparison with corresponding experimental results.
