40|$|The {{monograph}} by Anna Engelking <b>Kolkhoz</b> <b>members.</b> Antropological {{study of}} {{identity in the}} Belorussian country {{at the turn of}} 20 th and 21 st centuries contains results of the research thet has been carried out for twenty years in Belarus. The author poses questions concerning the identity of Belarussian <b>Kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> formed by themselves and shows that it is based on clear contrasts: peasant / landlord, Christian / Jew, believing / unbelieving. These contrasts are rooted in the past but the author shows that the contemporary Belorussian country is immersed in the past and earlier social order is still present in people’s minds despite political and economic changes...|$|R
50|$|The private plots {{were also}} an {{important}} source of income for rural households. In 1977, families of <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> obtained 72% of their meat, 76% of their eggs and most of their potatoes from private holdings. Surplus products, as well as surplus livestock, were sold to kolkhozy and sovkhozy and also to state consumer cooperatives. Statistics may actually under-represent the total contribution of private plots to Soviet agriculture. The only time when private plots were completely banned was during collectivization, when famine took millions of lives.|$|R
50|$|The first {{village with}} a “Last Address” sign was the village Kupros of Yusva district, Komi-Permyak Okrug. The {{memorial}} sign was installed on 11 August 2015 on the façade {{of the house}} that was the last residential address of peasant Valentin Startsev, declared by investigators “an active participant of the liquidated counterrevolutionary insurgent organization.” Investigators claimed that Startsev was “conducting counterrevolutionary defeatist agitation among <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members,</b> trying to prove the inevitability of the fall of Soviet power,” “praising the old Tsarist regime and proving unprofitability of kolkhozes”; as a result, he was sentenced to capital punishment in the form of execution by a firing squad.|$|R
5000|$|During the Second Five-Year Plan, {{under the}} policy of [...] "cultural revolution" [...] , the Soviet {{authorities}} established fines that were collected from farmers. Citing Siegelbaum's Stakhanovism in her book Everyday Stalinism, Fitzpatrick wrote: [...] "...in a district in the Voronezh Region, one rural soviet chairman imposed fines on <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> totaling 60,000 rubles in 1935 and 1936: [...] "He imposed the fines on any pretext and at his own discretion - for not showing up for work, for not attending literacy classes, for 'impolite language', for not having dogs tied up... Kolkhoznik M. A. Gorshkov was fined 25 rubles {{for the fact that}} 'in his hut the floors were not washed'".|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the achievements of}} the Soviet authorities in the transformation of rural life and the expansion of agricultural production over the past fifty years. Collectivization has erased the old class structures and opened prospects for modern large-lscale production. The standards of living of the peasants have gone up and there have been spectacular results in the cultural advancement of the rural population (in comparison with the late 19 th c., when about 70 per cent of the rural population was illiterate, there are practically no illiterate people left today). Growing mechanization, experts, social and health insurance of <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members,</b> and increased real incomes is proof that the inherited difference between the living standards of urban and rural communities in the first country of socialism is rapidly diminishing...|$|R
5000|$|They imposed {{detailed}} work {{programs and}} nominated their preferred managerial candidates. [...] Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes {{had been in}} effect {{an offshoot of the}} state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. Subsequently, numerous kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to sovkhozes. The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev’s administration authorized a guaranteed wage to <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members,</b> similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area in collective {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{existing}} {{practice of}} administrative punishment known as black board (blacklist) by the November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine {{was applied to}} a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be underperforming in the grain collection procurement: [...] "Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations." [...] Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants who were not <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> and who were underperforming in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To [...] "reach the grain procurement quota" [...] amongst peasants, 1100 brigades, consisting of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it, were organized.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{claim that}} in December 1932, Soviets imposed special sanctions and blockade by NKVD units {{which led to}} complete extermination by starvation of certain villages and areas. The blacklist was applied with harsher methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that {{were considered to be}} [...] "underperforming" [...] in the grain collection procurement: [...] "Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations." [...] Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants, who were not <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> and who were [...] "underperforming" [...] in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To reach the grain procurement quota amongst peasants, 1100 brigades were organized, which consisted of activists, often from neighboring villages, who had either already accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it.|$|R
50|$|Members of kolkhozy had {{the right}} to hold a small area of private land and some animals. The size of the private plot varied over the Soviet period, but was usually about 1 acre. Before the Russian Revolution of 1917 a peasant with less than 13.5 acre was {{considered}} too poor to maintain a family. However, the productivity of such plots is reflected in the fact that in 1938 3.9 percent of total sown land was in the form of private plots, but in 1937 those plots produced 21.5 percent of gross agriculture output. Kolkhozniki had to do a minimum number of days work per year both on the kolkhoz and on other government work (such as road building). In one kolkhoz the requirements were a minimum of 130 days a year for each able-bodied adult and 50 days per boy aged between 12 and 16. That was distributed around the year according to the agricultural cycle. If <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> did not perform the required minimum of work, the penalties could involve confiscation of the farmer's private plot, a trial in front of a People's Court that could result in three to eight months of hard labour on the kolkhoz or up to one year in a corrective labor camp.|$|R
5000|$|The existed {{practice}} of administrative punishment known as “black board” (black list) by the November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine {{was applied to}} a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be [...] "underperforming" [...] in the grain collection procurement: “Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores”. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.” [...] Initially such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants, who were not <b>kolkhoz</b> <b>members</b> and who were [...] "underperforming" [...] in the grain collection procurement, special “measures” were adopted. To “reach the grain procurement quota” amongst peasants 1,100 brigades were organized which consisted of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it. Since most of goods supplied to the rural areas was commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and was sometimes obtained by villagers from neighbored cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained for a long period - as an example mentioned in the December 6 Decree the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist only October 17, 1933 when they completed their plan for grain collection early. Since January 1933 the black list regime was “softened” when 100% of plan execution was no longer demanded, mentioned in the December 6 Decree villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after 88 and 70% of plan completion respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>kolkhoz,</b> a <b>member,</b> {{called a}} kolkhoznik (колхо́зник, {{feminine}} form kolkhoznitsa, [...] колхо́зница), received {{a share of}} the farm's product and profit according to the number of days worked, whereas a sovkhoz employed salaried workers. In practice, most kolkhozy did not pay their [...] "members" [...] in cash at all. In 1946, 30 percent of kolkhozy paid no cash for labor at all, 10.6 paid no grain, and 73.2 percent paid 500 grams of grain or less per day worked. In addition the kolkhoz was required to sell its grain crop and other products to the State at fixed prices. These were set by Soviet government very low, and the difference between what the State paid the farm and what the State charged consumers represented a major source of income for the Soviet government.|$|R
5000|$|Tribal lands were {{forcibly}} [...] "donated" [...] for {{the advancement}} of the Soviet cause. This land was divided into hunting/herding areas, fishing sections and specific slaughtering points, often for reindeer. After being placed in the collective, indigenous peoples were redistributed to manage these areas, with an emphasis on food production to support the increase in urban population. [...] The collective divided members into two types of workers: sovkhoz and kolkhoz. The sovkhoz were members that earned wages, for example reindeer breeders. The <b>kolkhoz</b> were <b>members</b> that shared in the profits, for example fishermen, whose profits oscillated depending on the season. Families were forced to rely on subsistence activities applied in a sedentary format: limited hunting, fishing, occasionally planting gardens. Some families were allowed to own individual stocks of cattle, reindeer and horses. This individual stock ownership allowed {{for the creation of a}} secondary economy under the radar of the Soviet system. For example, fishing brigades would make a small profit selling caviar to visitors. Reindeer breeding was allowed, being of substantial use to the Soviets, though it operated under the assumption that it would eventually be phased out. Reindeer breeders were perceived as primitive and uneducated, undesirable for the Soviet structure. Despite mistreatment of the reindeer herds and attempts to phase out the practice, it underwent a revival in the 1970s, as improved veterinary practices and the use of helicopters for transportation facilitated better herd management.|$|R
