40|$|Baiyangdian (BYD) {{virus is}} a recently-identified mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes severe disease in ducks, with {{extremely}} rapid transmission, up to 15 % mortality within 10 days and 90 % reduction in egg production on <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> within 5 days of infection. Because of the zoonotic nature of flaviviruses, {{the characterization of}} BYD virus and its epidemiology are important public health concerns. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of this novel virus. We validate the model against BYD outbreak data collected from <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> in Southeast China, as well as experimental data obtained from an animal facility. Based on our model, the basic reproductive number of BYD virus is high (R 0  =  21) indicating that this virus is highly transmissible, consistent with the dramatic epidemiology observed in BYDV-affected <b>duck</b> <b>farms.</b> Our results indicate that younger ducks are more vulnerable to BYD disease and that ducks infected with BYD virus reduce egg production (to about 33 % on average) for about 3 days post-infection; after 3 days infected ducks are {{no longer able to}} produce eggs. Using our model, we predict that control measures which reduce contact between mosquitoes and ducks such as mosquito nets are more effective than insecticides...|$|R

Data consisted of primary data as a result of direct observation and discussion with respondents. Parameters observed were egg production, farm size, costs of production, farm revenue and income. Data were analysed using variance analysed based on the nested classification and honestly significance different. The results showed that the intensive farming in the agricultural area (Purbalingga) had a higher egg production (60. 42 %) than that in the fishery area (Cilacap). Farm revenue and production cost under intensive system in agricultural area was higher; consequenlty the income of both sysems in the area relatively similar.

The farm-level adjusted NTS prevalence was 64 · 7 %, 94 · 3 % and 91 · 3 % for chicken, <b>duck</b> and pig <b>farms,</b> respectively. Factors independently associated with NTS were <b>duck</b> <b>farms</b> [odds ratio (OR) 21 · 2], farm with > 50 pigs (OR 11 · 9), pig farm with 5 - 50 pigs (OR 4 · 88) (vs. chickens), and frequent rodent sightings (OR 2 · 3).
