40|$|It is {{possible}} to model life contingency insurances with the lifecontingencies R package, which is capable of performing financial and actuarial mathematics calculations. Its functions permit one to determine both the expected value and the stochastic distribution of <b>insured</b> <b>benefits.</b> Therefore, life insurance coverage can be priced and portfolios risk-based capital requirements can be assessed. This paper briefly summarizes the theory regarding life contingencies {{that is based on}} financial mathematics and demographic con- cepts. Then, with the aid of applied examples, it shows how the lifecontingencies package can be a useful tool for executing routine, deterministic, or stochastic calculations for life-contingencies actuarial mathematics...|$|E
40|$|Background. Healthcare {{has become}} a major expense. Burnout and its {{connection}} with psychological and physical health is well researched, yet little research has been done on the connection between burnout and financial outcomes, specifically as indicated by the costs incurred by medical aid providers as a result of members ’ claims. Objective. To investigate the connection between employee burnout and medical aid claims and expenditure data in a sample from the private sector. Method. A cross-sectional design was used. The sample comprised 3 182 participants. The available objective medical aid expenditure data connected with each participant were: total <b>insured</b> <b>benefits,</b> general practitioner visits, specialist visits, general practitioner <b>insured</b> <b>benefits,</b> and claims for medicine. A low and a high burnout group were extracted, based on comorbidity of the two core components of burnout. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was then applied to investigate the differences in estimated marginal means of the expenditures on the low and the high burnout contrast groups, while controlling for age and gender. Results. The high burnout group frequented a general practitioner more often, and the medical aid provider expenditure was nearly double that of the low burnout group, on all the variables. Specialist visits did not show a significant result. Conclusion. High burnout is associated with a higher expenditure by a medical aid provider, compared with low burnout, per member. Stakeholders should therefore address burnout to reduce expenditure and promote health. S Afr Med J 2013; 103 (2) : 89 - 93. DOI: 10. 7196 /SAMJ. 606...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to draw attention}} to some important lessons that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) can learn from the experience of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). FSLIC was the government agency that insured deposits at savings and loan associations until it was replaced in 1989 leaving a massive deficit to be financed by taxpayers. Like FSLIC, the PBGC is a government agency that guarantees a form of private corporate debt. As guarantor of the pension benefits promised by private plan sponsors, the PBGC bears the risk of a shortfall between the value of <b>insured</b> <b>benefits</b> and the assets securing those benefits. There has been a significant change in the attitude and behavior of senior public officials and legislators {{as a result of the}} S&L debacle. Directors of the PBGC and Secretaries of Labor to whom they report have pointed out the weaknesses of some of the pension funds that the PBGC insures and have pursued an active legislative agenda designed to reduce the PBGC's vulnerability to those weaknesses. Those efforts have resulted in a series of laws and amendments to laws that have significantly improved the U. S. pension guarantee system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the demand and supply of medical {{services for the}} elderly in a health services system characterized by a per-month fixed copayment and a selective capitation fee scheme for outpatients with chronic diseases.

A physician, however, provides more services to the beneficiary, partly because of the lowered copayment.

This will be selected only where capitation is more profitable than fee-for-service.

40|$|If {{the intent}} of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, was to assure that {{beneficiaries}} of insolvent pension plans receive adequate pension benefits, sharp increases in nominal rates of interest have blunted that purpose. Without an increase in these rates, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, the insurance agency established to guarantee benefits, faced large liabilities on the terminations of pension plans. We examine the economics of pension funds and the funding of pension funds before and after the enactment of ERISA. The Act changed the economics of pension funds. The PBGC, the employer, and the employees have interests in the assets of the pension plan. The PBGC can tax corporations to pay off liabilities and to fund guaranteed benefits; employers can terminate pension plans or overfund them; employees can ask for more benefits or claim the assets in the fund. Although the PBGC <b>insures</b> <b>benefits,</b> the insurance agent forbears, not acting quickly to protect its own interests. To prevent potential huge increases in its liabilities, the PBGC could require that employers hedge the guaranteed benefits, and fund their increases in promised benefits. Given its policies, these requirements could protect the PBGC. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{suggested}} by the theory of insurance demand, the direct effect of government subsidies is to allow cheaper out-of-pocket premiums to encourage voluntary participation (Coble and Barnett 2012).
