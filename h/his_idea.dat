5|$|When {{it comes}} time for Jack's {{important}} meeting with the network and showdown against Devon Banks, Liz is too busy pursuing Floyd to help Jack with <b>his</b> <b>idea.</b> Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.|$|E
5|$|By January 1831 Balzac had {{generated}} enough {{interest in}} <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> {{to secure a}} contract with publishers Charles Gosselin and Urbain Canel. They agreed on 750copies of an octavo edition, with a fee of 1,125francs paid to the author upon receipt of the manuscriptâ€“ by mid-February. Balzac delivered the novel in July.|$|E
5|$|Fransen {{failed to}} explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone {{overseas}} was copying <b>his</b> <b>idea.</b> After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Kramer {{is tired}} of seeing all <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> {{implemented}} before {{he has a chance}} to implement them himself. He contends that all the little day to day incidental things keep getting in his way and prevent him from realizing <b>his</b> <b>ideas.</b> He gets an intern from New York University, Darin, to help him out with [...] "Kramerica Industries", the corporation he had previously set up to develop some of <b>his</b> <b>ideas.</b> With this help, he'll be freed from those day-to-day activities and be able to develop <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> (such as the oil tanker bladder).|$|R

5|$|McNeile {{continued}} writing {{after he}} left the army in 1919, although he stopped writing war stories and began to publish thrillers. In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> of an English gentleman and his friend Gerard Fairlie. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Shatner had {{presented}} <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> to studio head Frank Mancuso while filming The Voyage Home. Mancuso liked Shatner's idea {{and agreed to}} hire a writer to draft a film treatment.

Shatner dictated the story himself {{and gave it to}} Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months, preferably 24 months. <b>His</b> <b>idea</b> to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his invention of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the lower segment cesarean section.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E

He set out <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> in the second edition of Of Pandas and People published in 1993, extensively revising Chapter 6 Biochemical Similarities with new sections on the complex mechanism of blood clotting and on the origin of proteins.|$|R
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. <b>His</b> <b>idea</b> that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E
5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, mentioned <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom}} {{he was working on}} the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections including the fact that Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and the concern that German audiences might confuse the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, Jean Baptiste Rives, a French {{adviser to the}} Hawaiian king KamehamehaII, {{traveled}} to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, when David Stirling was {{pitching}} <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> for a dedicated airborne commando unit (which later evolved into the Special Air Service) he obtained Clarke's support partly by promising to use the SAS name. From late 1942, Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major order of battle deception (codenamed Operation Cascade). The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division; between then {{and the end of}} the war it was used to mislead Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa, and as part of several specific tactical deceptions.|$|E
5|$|Jan Henryk DÄ…browski, {{a former}} {{high-ranking}} {{officer in the}} army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, began his work in 1796â€“ a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth. At that time he went to Paris, and later, Milan, where <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland. DÄ…browski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of Lombardy. This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
