40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm cable <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> respectively.

40|$|A {{deployable}} geodesic {{truss structure}} {{which can be}} deployed from a stowed state to an erected state is described. The truss structure includes a series of bays, each bay having sets of battens connected by longitudinal <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> which give the bay its axial and torsional stiffness. The <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> are hinged at their mid point by a joint so that the <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> are foldable for deployment or collapsing. The bays are deployed and stabilized by actuator means connected between the mid point joints of the <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Hinged longerons may be provided to also connect the sets of battens and to collapse for stowing {{with the rest of}} the truss structure...|$|R

40|$|DE 102008053586 A 1 UPAB: 20100511 NOVELTY - The {{drawing die}} (2) has a hollow channel which {{is divided into}} four channel {{sections}} (a-d) in the channel longitudinal direction, which continuously limit together in the channel longitudinal direction. The former channel section reduces continuously along the channel section assigned to the channel cross section from the outgoing cross section to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> section. The latter channel section has a channel length and a constant channel cross section which corresponds to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> section. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for reducing tensile stress at surfaces in circumferential direction during pulling or spinning of wires. USE - Drawing die for reducing the cross section of a wire. ADVANTAGE - The drawing die has a hollow channel which is divided into four channel sections in the channel longitudinal direction, which continuously limit together in the channel longitudinal direction, where the former channel section reduces continuously along the channel section assigned to the channel cross section from the outgoing cross section to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> section, and hence ensures reduced frequency of occurrence of splits on pulling wires in a cost effective and time-saving manner, improved quality of drawn wires, and improved efficiency of the drawing process...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process. A thermo-mechanical analysis was also conducted with the finite element method to discuss the springback results...|$|R
