5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, {{greater than that of}} Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E

5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b> Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion {{resonances}} with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E

40|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{surveys are}} beginning to reach the time baselines required to detect Jupiter analogs, as well as sub-Saturn mass planets in close orbits. Therefore {{it is important to}} understand the sensitivity of these surveys at long periods and low amplitudes. In this paper, I derive analytic expressions for the detectability of planets at both short and long periods, for circular and <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits.</b> I suggest an extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for Keplerian orbits, and describe how to estimate the false alarm probability associated with a Keplerian fit. Using this to investigate the detectability of <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> shows that there are significant selection effects against <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> for e> 0. 6, and the small number of highly eccentric planets discovered so far may reflect this. Finally, I present a Bayesian approach to the periodogram, which emphasises the equivalence of least squares and periodogram techniques. Comment: MNRAS, in press (12 pages, 13 figures...|$|R
5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days have almost {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> and its discoverers hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU).

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula.

40|$|Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with {{diameter}} d> 100 km moving now in {{not very}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> could be formed {{directly by the}} compression of large rarefied dust condensations (with semi-major axes a> 30 AU), but not by the accretion of smaller solid planetesimals.

5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the Kuiper belt. When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E
5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations {{will be required to}} check that hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly higher than that of Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space.

Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b> The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
