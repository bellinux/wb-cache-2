This paper tests whether a productivity pecking order also determines <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>activities.</b> We use a novel dataset of all German banks' international activities to estimate the ordered probability of being present abroad (extensive margin) and the volume of international assets (intensive margin). Methodologically, we enrich the conventional Heckman selection-model {{to account for the}} self-selection of banks into different modes of foreign activities based on an ordered probit. Our paper has four main findings. First, as for non-financial firms, we find a productivity pattern order driving bank internationalization. Second, while only a few non- financial firms engage in international trade, many banks hold international assets. Only a few large banks engage in FDI.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} various channels of financial contagion across countries. This paper first presents stylized facts of <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>activities</b> during the crisis. It then describes a simple model of financial contagion based on bank balance sheet identities and behavioral assumptions of deleveraging. Cascade effects can be triggered by bank losses or contractions of interbank lending activities. As a result of shocks on assets or on liabilities of banks, a global deleveraging of <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>activities</b> can occur. Simple simulations are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} model and the relative importance of contagion channels, relying on bank losses of advanced countries’ banking systems during the {{financial crisis}} to calibrate the shock. The outcome of the simulations is compared with the deleveraging observed during the crisis suggesting that leverage is a major determinant of financial contagion.

The following key findings emerge: 1) The empirical "gravity" model is the benchmark in explaining the volume of <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>activities.</b> 2) Conditioned on standard gravity factors (distance, GDP, population), well-functioning institutions are a key driving force for international bank flows. Specifically, foreign banks invest substantially more in countries with i) uncorrupt bureaucracies, ii) high-quality legal system, and iii) a non-government controlled banking system. 3) Beyond institutions, politics exert also a firstorder impact. 4) The European Integration process has spurred cross-border banking activities between member states. These results are robust to various econometric methodologies, samples and the potential endogeneity of institutional characteristics. The strong institutions/politics-bank flows nexus has strong implications for asset trade and international macro theories, which have not modelled these relationships explicitly.

I explore the international activities of Mexican commercial banks in the years preceding the country's default and demonstrate that they became involved in international lending which was funded largely through heavy short-term interbank foreign borrowing. I provide new archival evidence which shows that in intermediating foreign finance with local public and private borrowers, Mexican banks incurred maturity, interest rate and currency mismatches and dangerously increased their risk position.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants {{and consequences of}} financial institutions voluntarily forming risk management committees (RMCs). Specifically, I determine whether RMCs are related {{to a change in}} risk outcomes, an increase in profitability, a change in hedging and trading derivative structures, and greater financial reporting quality during the post-committee formation period compared to a control group. I use a sample of financial institutions that form a RMC in any year from 1994 through 2008 and a control sample of financial institutions that do not form a RMC during the sample period. The results provide evidence to suggest that financial institutions with a higher level of risk, a Chief Risk Officer (CRO), lower financial reporting quality, a larger board, a board that has a greater proportion of independent members, <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>activity,</b> merger and acquisition activity, a CEO as Chairman of the Board, and a Big N auditor, are more likely to form a RMC. There is some evidence to suggest that RMC formation is negatively associated with a change in risk only for financial institutions with a high-level of risk in the year prior to RMC formation. RMCs and CROs act as substitutes (not complements) when it comes to reducing non-performing assets and loan charge-offs in high risk firms. Additionally, the results provide some evidence to suggest that RMC formation is associated with an increase in the notional values of both hedging and trading derivatives. Interestingly, for firms with a high notional value of trading derivatives, a CRO serves as a mitigating force to reduce the notional value of trading derivatives. Moreover, for firms with a low level of profitability, RMC formation is not associated with a change in profitability. However, the presence of a CRO is related to an increase in profitability. The presence of both a RMC formation and a CRO is associated with a decrease in profitability. Therefore, RMCs and CROs do not act as substitutes r complements when it comes to increasing profitability in firms with a low level of profitability...|$|R

Comparative studies often focus on indicators of financial activity {{in a particular}} location, but the prominence of an <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> centre also reflects cross-border linkages with banks in other locations.

JEL Classification: F 34, G 21, L 14, C 45. The rise of international financial centres is a topic of long-standing interest. Their historical formation has been studied from various angles (Kindleberger (1974), Cassis (2006)). The topic is receiving renewed attention as the preeminent global financial centres, London and New York, are increasingly complemented by regional centres such as Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, and as new financial centres in the Arab world seek to establish an international presence. The <b>activities</b> of <b>banks</b> within <b>international</b> financial centres often receive special scrutiny under the heading of <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> centres (eg Choi et al (1996, 2003)). But what exactly is an <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> centre? Banking centres are often defined as an agglomeration of <b>banking</b> <b>activity</b> in a specific location, performing a range of functions or combining a number of markets.

This measure is applied to discriminate between the Market Structure and Efficient-Structure hypotheses in a coherent forward-looking framework, in which differences in banks’ horizontal and vertical differentiation strategies are controlled for. The results show that banks with better management or production technologies possess a long-run competitive advantage. In addition, bank market concentration does not affect all banks equally. Only the banks with a large market share in a concentrated market are able to generate non-competitive rents.
