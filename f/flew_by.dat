5|$|In 2000, the Cassini probe <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter {{on its way}} to Saturn, and {{provided}} some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to visit Jupiter were Pioneer10 in 1973, and Pioneer11 a year later, taking low-resolution {{images of the}} four Galilean moons. The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity onIo {{and the presence of}} water ice on the surface of Europa. The Cassini probe to Saturn <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's extended atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites' orbital parameters.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} {{to explore the}} Kuiper belt, New Horizons, was launched, which <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's goal was to locate and investigate other, farther objects in the Kuiper belt.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire systems to control aircraft was demonstrated by developing and flight testing a single channel system, which used Apollo hardware, in an F- 8 C test airplane. This {{is the first}} airplane to fly with a digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire system as its primary means of control and with no mechanical reversion capability. The development and flight test of a triplex digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire system, which will serve as an experimental prototype for future operational digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire systems, are underway...|$|R
5|$|The New Horizons probe <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter for a {{gravity assist}} {{en route to}} Pluto. Its closest {{approach}} was on February 28, 2007. The probe's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail, as well as making long-distance observations of the outer moons Himalia and Elara. Imaging of the Jovian system began September 4, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{properties}} of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It {{was found to}} have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until Voyager 2 <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{completion}} of its primary mission, proposals were made to further utilize the spacecraft. Consequently, Deep Impact <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Earth on December 31, 2007 {{on its way to}} an extended mission, designated EPOXI, with a dual purpose to study extrasolar planets and comet Hartley 2 (103P/Hartley).|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2015, the Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{began to}} orbit Ceres, {{becoming the first}} spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet. On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons space probe <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Pluto and its five moons. Dawn has also explored the former dwarf planet Vesta. Phoebe has been explored by Cassini (most recently) and Voyager 2, which also explored Triton. These three {{are thought to be}} former dwarf planets and therefore their exploration helps {{in the study of the}} evolution of dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E
5|$|The New Horizons probe, {{en route}} to Pluto, <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter for a gravity assist {{and was the first}} probe {{launched}} directly towards Jupiter since the Ulysses in 1990. Its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) took its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006. The spacecraft began further study of the Jovian system in December 2006, and made its closest approach on February 28, 2007.|$|E

5|$|The New Horizons spacecraft, {{en route}} to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> the Jovian system and Io on 28 February 2007. During the encounter, {{numerous}} distant observations of Io were obtained. These included images of a large plume at Tvashtar, providing the first detailed observations of the largest class of Ionian volcanic plume since observations of Pele's plume in 1979. New Horizons also captured images of a volcano near Girru Patera {{in the early stages}} of an eruption, and several volcanic eruptions that have occurred since Galileo.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground support}} echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of {{embarkation}} at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22.|$|E
5|$|When the Cassini {{spacecraft}} <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo. New Horizons passed {{close to}} Jupiter in 2007, {{carrying out a}} unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail, traveling as far as 2500RJ along its length. In July 2016 Juno was inserted into Jupiter orbit, its scientific objectives include exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. The coverage of Jupiter's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth's magnetic field. Further study is important to further understand the Jovian magnetosphere's dynamics.|$|E

50|$|On 8 May 1960, a {{world record}} was set for the {{distance}} <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> a model aircraft at 45.75 mi. The 8 ft wingspan aircraft had taken off from Lympne and was <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> radio control from cars to Sidcup.|$|R
5|$|The Galileo {{mission was}} twice {{extended}}, in 1997 and 2000. During these extended missions, the probe <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> Io {{three times in}} late 1999 and early 2000 and three times in late 2001 and early 2002. Observations during these encounters revealed the geologic processes occurring at Io's volcanoes and mountains, excluded {{the presence of a}} magnetic field, and demonstrated the extent of volcanic activity. In December 2000, the Cassini spacecraft had a distant and brief encounter with the Jovian system en route to Saturn, allowing for joint observations with Galileo. These observations revealed a new plume at Tvashtar Paterae and provided insights into Io's aurorae.|$|E
5|$|The NBC radio crew {{aboard the}} lead bomber made its live {{broadcast}} coast-to-coast as the bombers <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> the Rex. The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured {{the next day}} {{on the front pages}} of hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|The aircrews trained {{continuously}} until May. Each bombardier {{completed at}} least 50 practice drops of inert pumpkin bombs before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945 to its {{port of embarkation}} at Seattle, Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. An advance party of the air echelon <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May. It was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station. It was from Tinian that it carried out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

50|$|From 10-16 September 2014, the RQ-4 fleet flew a {{total of}} 781 hours, the most hours <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> the type during a single week. 87 percent of flights were made by USAF RQ-4s, with the rest <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> the Navy BAMS-D and NASA {{hurricane}} research aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which <b>flew</b> <b>by</b> the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E
5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he <b>flew</b> <b>by.</b> On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain {{more than a handful}} of successes against the Gothas.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and <b>flew</b> <b>by.</b> They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
