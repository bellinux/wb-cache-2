5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark, {{which follows}} {{the events of}} Blood-C, {{is set in a}} version of Earth where humans are preyed upon by monsters called <b>Elder</b> Bairns; to keep humans safe, the <b>Elder</b> Bairns honor a {{covenant}} dubbed Shrovetide, a contract between humans and <b>Elder</b> Bairns that allows <b>Elder</b> Bairns to feed on humans for a limited period of time. During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights <b>Elder</b> Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an <b>Elder</b> Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone involved is massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the use of the internet.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{the task}} force unit, she fights the head of Tower's {{security}} forces Kutō, killing him after he uses a vial of Saya's blood to transform into an <b>Elder</b> Bairn hybrid. Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the <b>Elder</b> Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to <b>Elder</b> Bairns has shifted drastically due to the <b>Elder</b> Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into an <b>Elder</b> Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches into a giant <b>Elder</b> Bairn which Saya slays. A weakened Fumito reveals that he transformed himself into an <b>Elder</b> Bairn hybrid to become closer to Saya and free her from her oath not to feed on humans. Accepting that he has lost their wager, he impales himself on Saya's sword. Saddened at being left alone again, Saya does not return to SIRRUT, instead opting to disappear. In the aftermath, Yūka becomes Tokyo's governor and repeals the Youth Ordinance Bill, the members of SIRRUT return to a normal life, and Mana begins searching for Saya.|$|E

40|$|Racial/ethnic {{variations}} in instrumental {{activities of daily}} living (IADL) caregiver network composition were examined in a nationally representative sample of <b>elders,</b> using task specificity and hierarchical compensatory theoretical perspectives.

Findings concerning racial/ethnic differences were partially dependent on marital status, differentiation of spouses from other informal helpers among married <b>elders,</b> and which racial/ethnic groups were compared. Networks including formal caregivers did not differentiate married or unmarried Black from White <b>elders</b> but were more common among unmarried Mexi-can American <b>elders</b> than for comparable White and Black <b>elders.</b> Married Black <b>elders</b> with solely informal networks were more likely than comparable White <b>elders</b> to have informal helpers other than the spouse. Racial/ethnic similarities and differ-ences in caregiver networks are discussed relative to their sociocultural context, including marital status, <b>elder’s</b> and spouse’s health, and financial resources...|$|R

Many community-oriented development projects call upon the <b>Elders</b> to lead the community to a healthier lifestyle. This research focused on what the community could be doing to help its <b>Elders</b> grow, and on what part the <b>Elders</b> play in gaining respect from the community. The research documents specific roles that respected <b>Elders</b> assume and are given in the community, the character traits that they are expected to display in the fulfillment of these roles, and also points out what the <b>Elders</b> need in return from the community.

5|$|Heraclius the <b>Elder</b> resurfaces a year later, {{under the}} command of Comentiolus, in the Battle of Sisarbanon (autumn 589), in the {{vicinity}} of Nisibis. According to the account of Theophylact, Comentiolus supposedly fled towards Theodosiopolis (modern Ra's al-'Ayn) while the battle was still ongoing. Heraclius the <b>Elder</b> took charge of the remaining troops and led them to victory. Theophylact, however, lived and wrote during the reign of Heraclius the Younger, and is strongly biased in favour of his father. His account is thus suspect of exaggerating or even inventing Comentiolus' cowardice with the aim of glorifying Heraclius the <b>Elder.</b> The contemporary Evagrius Scholasticus, for instance, credits Comentiolus with being in the thick of combat, and does not mention Heraclius the <b>Elder</b> at all.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} pneumonia by COPD status and the excess cost of inpatient primary pneumonia in <b>elders</b> with COPD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, longitudinal study using claims linked to eligibility/demographic data for a 5 % sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2005 through 2007. METHODS: Incidence rates of pneumonia were calculated for <b>elders</b> with and without COPD and for <b>elders</b> with COPD and coexistent congestive heart failure (CHF). Propensity-score matching with multivariate generalized linear regression was used to {{estimate the}} excess direct medical cost of inpatient primary pneumonia in <b>elders</b> with COPD as compared with <b>elders</b> with COPD but without a pneumonia hospitalization. RESULTS: <b>Elders</b> with COPD had nearly six-times the incidence of pneumonia compared with <b>elders</b> without COPD (167. 6 / 1000 person-years versus 29. 5 / 1000 person-years; RR= 5. 7, p < 0. 01); RR increased to 8. 1 for <b>elders</b> with COPD and CHF compared with <b>elders</b> without COPD. The incidence of inpatient primary pneumonia among <b>elders</b> with COPD was 54. 2 / 1000 person-years compared with 7 / 1000 person-years for <b>elders</b> without COPD; RR= 7. 7, p< 0. 01); RR increased to 11. 0 for <b>elders</b> with COPD and CHF compared with <b>elders</b> without COPD. The one-year excess direct medical cost of inpatient pneumonia in COPD patients was $ 22, 697 ($ 45, 456 in cases vs. $ 22, 759 in controls (p < 0. 01)); 70. 2 % of this cost was accrued during the quarter of the index hospitalization. During months 13 through 24 following the index hospitalization, the excess direct medical cost was $ 5, 941 ($ 23, 215 in cases vs. $ 17, 274 in controls, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia occurs more frequently in <b>elders</b> with COPD than without COPD. The excess direct medical cost in <b>elders</b> with inpatient pneumonia extends up to 24 months following the index hospitalization and represents $ 28, 638 in 2010 dollars...|$|R
