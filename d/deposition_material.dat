Originally it {{was part}} of an ancient river system that was cut off by <b>deposition</b> <b>material</b> and became two small lakes divided by a narrow peninsula.

A unique set of alloys with a specifically designated chemical composition was manufactured for experiments. Their properties in defined abrasive conditions was studied in laboratory conditions. Wear resistance was determined on an experimental bench with bound particles.

40|$|Morphological, {{particularly}} textural, discontinuities between horizons increase soil erodibility in Depressão Central, Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil). Characterization of such discontinuities {{would help}} to understand landscape evolution and to model near-surface hydrology.

Transported material was meant to be mineral particles found in the soil profile, transported probably by water or gravity, that were not present neither in the parent material nor derived from it.
