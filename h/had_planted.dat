5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E

5|$|Alex is able {{to prove}} her innocence in the Grand Central Terminal bombing {{with the help of}} her classmates at Quantico and discovers that the {{suspected}} bomber was former FBI analyst-trainee Elias Harper (Rick Cosnett), who <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> the bomb under the instruction of a terrorist mastermind. Having cleared her name in a congressional hearing, Alex is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office in New York City, specifically the operations section, and now strives to uncover the true mastermind behind the bombings as the 2016 Presidential election draws ever closer. Prior to the election, the terrorist kills Natalie Vasquez and Drew Perales to force Alex into doing his bidding. At the end of season one, Liam is revealed to be the traitor, with Alex and Ryan killing him in the finale. After the bombings, the ensuing publicity, and Simon Asher's death, Alex is fired from the FBI. Two months after the presidential election, Alex is approached by Matthew Keyes (Henry Czerny), the director of the CIA, who extends an offer for her to join and work for the organization.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Steeple Tree Hill, the Japanese were less {{inclined}} to engage the Australian forces, nevertheless the advance continued to be frustratingly slow for the Australian commanders. The terrain over which the final part of the advance was undertaken was particularly taxing on the troops involved. Many of the slopes up which {{they were required to}} advance had gradients of at least 45 degrees, which meant that even reasonably short distances took considerable time To make matters worse, near the junction of the Siki Creek, a landslide caused by the Allied bombing, coupled with a number of land mines that the Japanese <b>had</b> <b>planted,</b> blocked the main road to Sattelberg, meaning that the soldiers from the 2/48th would have to make the final attack on Sattelberg without armoured support. In an effort to counter this problem, Whitehead determined that the tanks would be re-allocated to the 2/23rd, in the hope that a new route would be opened up by the engineers.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll {{as long as she}} was paid no more than the fair market value for her services. In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> a bogus candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.|$|E

5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter.

He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a detonator from down the street. However, the bomb {{in the house was}} a decoy; Angie <b>had</b> <b>planted</b> the actual bomb in the detonator.

Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however {{he was in a}} French prison (again, on narcotics charges) {{at the time of the}} attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all.|$|E
