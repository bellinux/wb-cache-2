5|$|Budget and {{management}} {{reforms in the}} 1980s and 1990s saw a change in budgeting, including a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> outcomes, and decreasing emphasis on inputs. This has been reflected {{in the activities of}} Senate committees, with Senators' questions being increasingly focussed on the 'results of government activities and away from a concern with inputs'.|$|E

Gandhi favoured an education system with far <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity {{the first priority}} in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976. In 1978 the National Council decided in a half-step backwards that Wood Badge needed to place <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the practical aspects of good troop operation {{along with a}} variety of leadership exercises. Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Government {{released}} a new Defence White Paper, Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force that placed a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed {{to improve the}} ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year; in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the Defence Updates emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the role of the father.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Some Western {{academics}} cautiously {{view the}} hadith collections as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations {{which have been}} compiled in later periods, but judge them {{in the context of}} history and {{on the basis of their}} compatibility with the events and figures. Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable chain of transmission (isnad); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable in their eyes.|$|E

The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> {{advancing}} in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance {{as far as possible}} in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
