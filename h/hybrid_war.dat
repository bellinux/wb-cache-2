50|$|Hybrid warfare is a {{military}} strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyberwarfare. By combining kinetic operations with subversive efforts, the aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution. Hybrid warfare {{can be used to}} describe the flexible and complex dynamics of the battlespace requiring a highly adaptable and resilient response. There are a variety of terms used to refer to the <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> concept: <b>hybrid</b> <b>war,</b> hybrid warfare, hybrid threat, or hybrid adversary (as well as non-linear war, non-traditional war or special war). US military bodies tend to speak in terms of a hybrid threat, while academic literature speaks of a hybrid warfare. For the purposes of this article, these terms are used interchangeably.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{offering}} a grand strategic framework to guide US government planners in fighting the war on terror. In order to use American power to advance our political objectives in this era, i. e. to act strategically, the US government should consider acting simultaneously along two interconnected strategic lines of operation. Each line describes a set of capabilities which are required to successfully shape the international system {{in such a way}} as to advance American interests and values. On the one hand, the US needs to perfect its capabilities in Hard-Kill operations: these are divided in turn into steady-state activities like covert global operations to eliminate Al Qaeda operatives and surge operations such as successfully conducting what Gen. Jim Mattis and Frank Hoffman called <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Wars.</b> On the other hand, America needs to shape the strategic environment by actively conducting Soft-Kill activities. In a steady state, these activities include, inter-alia, training allied forces to better apprehend terrorists in their own territories, helping build economic or political institutions in undeveloped areas prone to infiltration by Islamic jihadists, and forming intelligence and military partnerships with local actors in strategically important places. In a surge status, the US needs to successfully conduct what the Pentagon now calls Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction operations, either to prevent a state from collapsing or following an American military intervention...|$|R

They {{relate to the}} interests of all the nations of the world, they pose a threat of degradation and end of civilization, they require immediate decision making, collective efforts and cooperation of all the nations. A number of problems in relationships between societies are examined, and the real ways of their solving are suggested. Some of them are connected to the relationships inside the world community: prevention of the nuclear conflict, overcoming the backwardness of the developing countries; the others reflect the crisis in the relationships between the society and the nature (demographic crisis, food crisis, resource crisis, ecological crisis, energy crisis and others). Some of the most difficult global threats of the XXI century – local armed conflicts and <b>hybrid</b> <b>wars</b> on geopolitical and territorial grounds (eg. between Israel and Palestine, Ukraine and Russian Federation etc.) are considered in the article.

40|$|The wars the Western armies are {{involved}} with today {{are different from those}} that were fought in the end of 20 th century. To explain this change, the Western military thinkers have come up with various different types of definitions of warfare over the last 30 years, each describing the tendencies involved in the conflicts of the time. The changing nature of conflicts surfaced a new term – hybrid warfare. The term was to describe and explain the multi-modality and complexity of modern day conflict. This thesis seeks the answer for the question: what is the development of thought behind hybrid warfare? In this thesis the Vietnam War (1965 - 1975) is used as an example of compound warfare focusing on the American involvement in the war. The Second Lebanon War (2006) serves as an example of hybrid warfare. Both case studies include an irregular opposing force, namely National Liberation Front in Vietnam War and Hezbollah in the Second Lebanon War. These two case studies are compared with the term full spectrum operations introduced in the current U. S. Department of Army Field Manual No. 3 - 0 Operations to see the differences and similarities of each term. The perspective of this thesis is the American point of view. This thesis concludes that hybrid warfare, compound warfare and full spectrum operations are very similar. The first two terms are included in the last one. Although hybrid warfare is not officially defined, it will most likely remain {{to be used in the}} discussion in the future, since <b>hybrid</b> <b>wars</b> and <b>hybrid</b> threats are officially accepted terms...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the guiding imperatives behind Russia’s grand {{strategy in the}} Mideast, including both its domestic decision-making institutional idiosyncrasies and the wider geopolitical considerations at play. It discusses the evolution of Russian strategy after the so-called “Arab Spring” events and into the present day, taking care to individually analyze Moscow’s most important bilateral relationships. The review begins by addressing Russia’s anti-terrorist intervention in Syria, before progressing to some words about the two competing foreign policy factions present in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After outlining the key differences between the Liberal and Military-Security camps, the work then broadly explains how their rivalry fi gures into the formulation of Russia’s overall grand strategy in the Mideast. Following that, it logically proceeds to examine the other bilateral relationships that are of signifi cance to Moscow, beginning with Turkey, Iraq, and Israel, and ending with Saudi Arabia and Iran. The goal of the research {{is to establish a}} very general understanding of how Russia’s foreign policy is presently practiced in the Mideast, how and why it got to where it is today, and forecast on the prospects for its further development. In doing this, the article relies on empirical observations and references several under-discussed news items that have evaded wider scrutiny. It also makes use of a few academic sources in proving that the geopolitical environment in which Russia conducts its present foreign policy was largely shaped by the US’ legacy of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Wars</b> on the region, which in hindsight created fertile ground for the revolution in Russia’s Mideast strategy. In summary, Russia seeks to replace the US as the Mideast countries’ most preferred and trusted partner, capitalizing off of Washington’s decline in regional infl uence brought about by the disastrous rise of Daesh and the controversial perceptions over the Iranian nuclear deal in order to fi ll the strategic void that’s been created in America’s wake, and as of the end of 2016, Moscow has been wildly successful...|$|R

50|$|Although {{many of the}} engagements of the American Revolution were conventional, {{guerrilla warfare}} was used {{to a certain extent}} during this {{conflict}} from 1775-1783, which made a huge difference. Guerrilla tactics were first used at the Battles of Lexington and Concord by the Patriots at April 19, 1775. George Washington sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British. During the Forage War, George Washington sent militia units with limited Continental Army support to launch raids and ambushes on British detachments and forage parties, the militia and Continental Army support would skirmish with British detachments in small scale battles and engagements. Throughout the Forage War, British casualties exceeded past 900. The Forage War raised morale for the Patriots as their guerrilla operations against the British were very effective. Next, there are other Americans that used hit and run raids, ambushes, and surprise attacks against the British such as William R. Davie, David Wooster, Francis Marion, Shadrach Inman, Daniel Morgan, Morgan's riflemen, and over mountain men. All these American guerrilla fighters did their part by using unconventional tactics to fight the British and loyalists. Nathanael Greene used a guerrilla strategy very effectively against Lord Cornwallis. First, Nathanael Greene would keep retreating to lure the British far from their supply lines, then send out his forces to fight in small skirmishes and engagements with British detachments to weaken them. Then fighting the conventional battle, Nathanael Greene fought Lord Cornwallis at Guilford Court House and gave him a severe blow. Although Lord Cornwallis was the victor, his victory was pyrrhic as he had too many casualties that he could ill afford. After the British surrender at Yorktown and America gaining their independence, many of these Americans who used guerrilla tactics and strategies became immortalized and romanticized as time passed. Although guerrilla warfare was frequently used when avoiding battles, the Americans fought in conventional linear formations in decisive battles against the British. The American Revolution could be seen as a <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> since both conventional and guerrilla warfare were used throughout its duration.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the theoretical construct of <b>hybrid</b> <b>war,</b> a newly introduced concept for rethinking modern complex conflicts. The study departs {{from the following}} research question: “How is <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> understood, {{and to what extent}} does the <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> construct support a useful perception of contemporary and prospective armed conflicts?” The aim of the study is twofold: Firstly, to conceptualize the term <b>hybrid</b> <b>war,</b> both by defining the context, and by suggesting a framework for analysis. And, secondly, to analyse whether this theoretical construct contributes to a useful and substantial insight for understanding ongoing and emerging armed conflicts of our time. The working method comprises an extensive analysis of written material on military theory such as books, reports and monographs, in addition to historical and contemporary studies, as well as articles and a variety of internet sources. Additionally, a two-case empirical study – on the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 respectively – is added to evaluate the feasibility of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> construct as an academic tool. The thesis suggests that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> construct provides a useful instrument to examine the dynamics and logics of a conflict actor’s planning, preparation and execution of armed resistance and combat operations against a superior high-technology conventional opponent. As such, the concept emerges within an asymmetric context employing both kinetic as well as non-kinetic means. A so-called hybrid actor is characterised by one who utilizes capabilities within the spheres of conventional, irregular, terrorist, and criminal approaches, including ‘soft-war’ approaches like information warfare and cyber-attack. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>war</b> is executed in an orchestrated “convergence and combination”-like fashion. By conclusion, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>war</b> construct may pave the way for a new way of thinking with regards to contemporary armed conflicts, challenging the academic establishment and encouraging the military policymakers towards a renewed concept development...|$|E
