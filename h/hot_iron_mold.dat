40|$|The role of {{the mold}} {{properties}} on gap nucleation in pure metal solidification is investigated. The mold {{is assumed to be}} finite and deformable, and has a sinusoidal surface micro-geometry. Unlike previous models, the model developed herein assumes that the mold material has a non-negligible thermal capacitance. Of particular interest are the roles played by the mold thickness and mold thermal capacitance on the existence of critical mold surface wavelength that corresponds to the situation where both contact pressure and its time derivative simultaneously fall to zero. The present work also assumes that the thermal and mechanical problems in the mold-shell interface are uncoupled. It is shown that the inclusion of the thermal capacitance of the mold material, together with thermal capacitance of the shell and the mold distortion, may be sufficient to predict a critical wavelength beyond which no gap nucleation occurs at the troughs. The {{role of the}} mold properties is examined through qualitative comparisons of the present and previous models. Gap nucleation times, associated mean shell thicknesses, and critical wavelengths are calculated for pure copper and pure <b>iron</b> <b>molds</b> under identical process conditions. It is found that a copper mold leads to faster gap nucleation compared to an <b>iron</b> <b>mold.</b> The associated critical wavelengths of <b>iron</b> <b>molds</b> are shown to be larger than those of copper. An optimum mean mold thickness corresponding to the longest gap nucleation time for a given set of process parameters is determined. The effect of the mean pressure on the optimum mold thickness is also investigated. King Saud Universit...|$|R
