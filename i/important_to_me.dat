5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then I {{came up with}} the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers are very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It's a complete joint effort.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
25|$|But {{the reality}} is, I respect, you know, {{the opinion of}} Catholic — (off mike) — {{religious}} leaders of all kinds. Religion is very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> it's {{a very important part}} of my life. But ultimately, as a — (off mike) — I’ve been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I’ve got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours.|$|E

500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "From day one, I {{was very}} clear that I wanted to shoot this thing in Europe. I really wanted that European feel of cold mountains, big forests, that sort of spirit was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Luckily we did get to shoot it in Germany which is the {{homeland}} of the fairy tale. Shooting in natural outdoor sets is very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> compared to working on a sound stage." [...] It took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, in a filming location at an old forest near Berlin (production designer Stephen Scott said that he searched for and found what he believed looked like a [...] "medieval forest" [...] free of human interference) and {{in the city of}} Braunschweig in Lower Saxony.

500|$|In January 2017, Cawthon {{stated that}} {{partially}} due to [...] "problems within {{the movie industry}} as a whole", the film [...] "was met with several delays and roadblocks" [...] and it was [...] "back at square one", but he promised [...] "to be involved with the movie from day one this time, and that's something extremely <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I want this movie {{to be something that}} I'm excited for the fanbase to see." ...|$|E

500|$|Morello {{elaborated}} {{that the}} Nightwatchman is now [...] "my principal musical focus, as I see it, {{for the remainder}} of my life. From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist." [...] He repeated this point {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times.|$|E
500|$|In May 2015, Hill {{canceled}} her scheduled concert outside Tel Aviv in Israel {{following a}} social media campaign from activists promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.

Hill stated: [...] "It is very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that my presence or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{was like}} a trip down memory lane, looking back at {{everything}} I've accomplished {{and all the things}} I once valued {{and all the things that}} were <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> What is my perspective now? I've fought for so many things, I've tried so hard to be number one and to stay on top, to look good, to be the best. And I realized that a lot of things that last and the things that matter are none of those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Manning is a Christian. At age 13, he said, [...] "I {{committed}} {{my life to}} Christ, {{and that}} faith has been most <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ever since."

She stepped a little in front of me, and then turned and faced me.|$|R

Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with this single to push boundaries {{a little bit and}} part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's been nice to release a ballad".|$|E
500|$|For dream {{sequences}} in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring {{practical effects}} whenever possible. Nolan said, [...] "It's always very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to do as}} much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically." [...] To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to [...] "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the game's {{traditional}} friendly feel, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier highlighted in pre-match press conference the importance of winning the Shield: [...] "It is very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> This match {{is more than a}} friendly. It represents the start of the season. The Community Shield is like a final. There is a trophy at stake and we are the holders."

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to not require Gillian Anderson at all. As a result, the {{finished}} episode only features stock footage of Scully from [...] "Within", and Anderson {{was not required}} to film any new scenes. Anderson later revealed that she was extremely grateful for this and other [...] "Doggett-centric" [...] episodes, because they provided her time {{to spend time with}} her daughter, Piper Maru, who was attending school in Canada. Anderson insisted that the show both understand her situation and make accommodations: in an interview, she explained, [...] "I was determined that they respect that I would work for three weeks and then have two or three weeks off to go and be with her. So they agreed to that, and that was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I'd never had that before on the show." ...|$|E

The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with it as a teenager, said, [...] "This campaign is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid".

6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{addressing}} Barré, [...] "you {{have been of}} the most <b>important</b> service <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I heartily acknowledge the obligation.

5000|$|The most <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was the Queen II album {{going into}} the charts - {{especially}} satisfying that, since the first one didn't do so well.
