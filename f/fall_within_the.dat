5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

5|$|The 1905 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five known tropical cyclones, {{two of which}} made landfall in the United States. The first system was initially observed near the Windward Islands on September6. The last system to dissipate, the fourth storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October11, while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Between October5 and October10, {{the fourth and fifth}} system existed simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates <b>fall</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> period {{with the most}} {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E
