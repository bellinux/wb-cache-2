500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E
2500|$|J.T., {{wounded and}} lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to {{detonate}} explosives {{to eliminate the}} remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when he puts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> stomach and restates his motto [...] "I never miss").|$|E
60|$|Then {{he stood}} with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, looking earnestly at her.|$|R
50|$|Then he put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and {{immediately}} she {{straightened up and}} praised God.|$|R
60|$|For {{answer the}} coachman put both <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. He {{was a heavy}} man, and she sat down again.|$|R
2500|$|Donor portraits have a {{continuous}} history from late antiquity, and the portrait in the 6th-century manuscript the Vienna Dioscurides may well reflect a long-established classical tradition, {{just as the}} author portraits found in the same manuscript are believed to do. [...] A painting in the Catacombs of Commodilla of 528 shows a throned Virgin and Child flanked by two saints, with Turtura, a female donor, {{in front of the}} left hand saint, who has <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder; very similar compositions were being produced a millennium later. Another tradition which had pre-Christian precedent was royal or imperial images showing the ruler with a religious figure, usually Christ or the Virgin Mary in Christian examples, with the divine and royal figures shown communicating with each other in some way. [...] Although none have survived, there is literary evidence of donor portraits in small chapels from the Early Christian period, probably continuing the traditions of pagan temples.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.‚Äù Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, on July 4, Jared Scott is {{beaten by}} his mother's boyfriend and slips into a coma. [...] The feeders, however, drive the boyfriend into a craze and {{he ends up}} accidentally killing himself. [...] Pick is {{captured}} by the demon, and Nest and John confront him {{at the site of}} the maentwrog tree. [...] While Nest's grandfather stops Derry Howe from injuring anyone at the fireworks show, the demon manages to release the maentwrog. [...] Through extensive magic use, John is able to defeat the creature, but passes out. [...] The demon takes advantage of this to confront Nest's grandmother, and kills her. The demon confronts Nest alone and teaches her of her past. [...] She learns that her grandmother once became friends with the demon and would [...] "run with him" [...] instead of fighting against him. At this time, she thought him simply another person, not a demon. The demon tried to seduce her grandmother, but she resisted, and turned to the side of the Word. [...] In revenge, the demon seduced her daughter, Nest's mother, and she bore him a daughter, Nest. [...] When Nest's mother found out after Nest was born that he was a demon, she apparently lost her mind and committed suicide. [...] Now the demon is back for Nest, and by touching her, he can convince her to join the Void. [...] Wraith appears, but the demon reveals that Wraith is actually a gift from the demon, sent to protect Nest until he could come back and claim her. [...] Nest holds the demon at bay for a time, but when he is about to lay <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> Wraith turns on the demon and tears him to pieces. [...] Nest learns from Pick that even though Wraith was created by the demon, her grandmother long ago expended all of her magic to convince Wraith to defend Nest against the demon as well.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked down}} at her most closely, and {{gradually}} compassion crept into his face. He set <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, she suffering it passively, insensibly.|$|R

60|$|He {{wondered}} why she said nothing. Did she understand? He put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|She lay mute and unmoving. He approached, laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> breast, {{and kissed}} her.|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed, his arms {{went out and}} around her. Then he stood with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulders}} and looking down into her face.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Keith {{thought she was}} going to faint. She had closed her eyes, and swayed so that he took a step, and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arms.|$|R
60|$|Tony {{looked down}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> gravely, with a curious wistfulness in his eyes, and then, before she quite grasped his intentions, laid <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulders}} {{and kissed her}} cheeks.|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} {{moved forward}} and quietly laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm {{as though to}} urge her to rise.|$|E
60|$|She {{was about}} to enter, when a solemn man, dressed all in black, laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} silence {{for a few moments}} until George rose and gently laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can help}} me not to be. Little Daphne, you {{can help me}} to forget." [...] He had stopped, and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. Without moving Daphne Wing answered: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{listened to}} what she said. Then {{he went up to}} <b>her</b> and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. <b>His</b> calmness, and the {{steadiness}} of his voice seemed to quieten her.|$|R
6000|$|Jake seemed dubious. [...] "It {{might be}} done and Barclay would be uncommonly glad to get <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> but I can't leave the sloop. Somebody has to take that message." ...|$|R
60|$|Raleigh gently laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm, {{and lifted}} her up, while Yeo and Amyas bent over the corpse.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave her}} a searching glance and then laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, holding her a little away from him.|$|E
60|$|She shrank, {{and dropped}} her head. The soft, {{penetrating}} grip of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm distressed her. She {{looked up at}} him.|$|E
50|$|Dutra thinks Abby is very attractive, and that's why {{he wants}} to get <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Loren helps Abby keep Dutra at a distance, and Dutra does not like that at all.|$|R
60|$|Weakly {{he reached}} up and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. He whispered in her ear. The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the button at his throat.|$|R
60|$|Moved beyond {{control by}} the little gulps and gasps of her breathing, {{he stepped forward}} and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. He held her lightly, without speaking, terrified lest he should wound her pride.|$|R
60|$|He paused {{before he}} {{answered}} me, and placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart. Then softly drew up the bed-linen, till it hid her face.|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly {{she felt}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> waist. She did not move, her heart beat too furiously; but {{a sort of}} prayer fluttered up from it against her lips. In the grip of those heavy hands was such quivering force! ...|$|R
