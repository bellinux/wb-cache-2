40|$|Objective:  To {{evaluate}} {{whether there is}} an association between maternal thyroid hormone and foetal cephalic head position at term gestation. Context:  Rotation and flexion of the head enables the foetus to negotiate the birth canal. Low-normal range thyroid hormone concentrations in euthyroid pregnant women constitute a risk of infant motor abnormality. We hypothesized that low normal maternal thyroid hormone levels are associated with increased risk of abnormal foetal position at delivery. Design:  In 960 healthy Dutch women with term gestation and cephalic <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation,</b> thyroid parameters [foetal T 4 (FT 4), TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibody] were assessed at 36 weeks of gestation, and related to foetal head position (anterior cephalic vs. abnormal cephalic) and delivery mode (spontaneous vs. assisted delivery). Results:  Women presenting in anterior position (n = 891) had significantly higher FT 4 levels at 36 weeks of gestation than those with abnormal cephalic presentation (n = 69). There were no between-group differences for TSH. Regression analyses indicated that the risk of abnormal head position decreased as a function of increasing FT 4 [single odds ratio (OR) = 0 · 87, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0 · 77 – 0 · 98; multivariate OR = 0 · 88, 95 % CI 0 · 72 – 0 · 99) ]. A similar inverse relationship between maternal FT 4 and risk of assisted delivery was obtained (OR = 0 · 86, 95 % CI 0 · 79 – 0 · 95; OR = 0 · 91, 95 % CI 0 · 84 – 0 · 98). Conclusion:  The lower the maternal FT 4 concentration at 36 weeks of gestation, the higher the risk of abnormal cephalic <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> and assisted delivery. Hennie A.

In case of caesarean section, advanced monitoring allows to optimize haemodynamic condition and to improve morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of pulse contour analysis calibrated by Trans-pulmonar thermodilution (Picco Plus® for the perioperative management of a caesarean section in a patient with severe cardiomyopathy. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 28 -year-old woman with a congenital heart disease who was submitted to a caesarean section under general anaesthesia for maternal pathology and <b>foetal</b> breech <b>presentation.</b> Intra- and post-operative management was optimized by advanced haemodynamic monitorization obtained by pulse contour wave analysis and thermodilution calibration (Picco Plus® monitor). The information about preload, myocardial contractility and postcharge was useful in guiding the fluid therapy and the use of vasoactive drugs. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates the importance of advanced haemodynamic monitoring with an acceptably invasive device in obstetric patients with high cardiac risk. The increasing experience in advanced haemodynamic management will probably permit to decrease morbidity and mortality of obstetric patients in the future...|$|R

40|$|Long-QT {{syndrome}} is a rare, inherited cardiac channelopathy that {{is characterized by}} arrhythmia, syncope and sudden cardiac death. Foetal symptoms are very rare and prenatal diagnosis is difficult. We report on a <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> of long-QT syndrome with severe hydrops and a chaotic heart rhythm at 32 weeks of gestation. Postnatal electrocardiography showed runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and an extremely prolonged-QT segment (QTc of 640 ms). The initial approach of overdrive pacing, followed by the combined therapy of a beta blocker, a sodium channel blocker (mexiletine) and potassium suppletion proved successful in maintaining a stable sinus rhythm. The girl was doing well at eight months of followup. In this patient a timely diagnosis and effective management after birth have been life-saving.

40|$|Background: Maternal {{mortality}} {{is associated with}} an ever-worrying trend in Madagascar. The partograph, {{set up by the}} WHO, is topical when it comes to maternal and child mortality-reducing strategies, especially in developing countries. This study assesses the effect of partograph use on maternal and neonatal mortality in maternity wards of ten basic health centres (BHC) and three hospitals located in the districts of Avaradrano, Atsimondrano, Ambohidratrimo, including the district hospital (DH) of Ambohidroa. Methods: Across-sectional survey was conducted in selected districts, using parturients&# 146; medical records during year 2010. Data were derived from the partographs of women meeting the following criteria: a spontaneous onset of labour, an uniparous pregnancy, a term birth, a <b>foetal</b> cephalic <b>presentation,</b> with no extra complication. Results: Neither maternal nor neonatal death was found where a partograph has been used. Partograph use rate is 64. 8 %. The main reasons for not using partographs include absence of training and lack of skilled health personnel. 128 abnormalities were identified with a correct management rate of 60. 9 %. Conclusions: Although implementation of the partograph appears to be easy and inexpensive, its use still collides with huge difficulties. It requires a qualified aid and a suitable environment to have a positive and significant impact on maternal and perinatal mortalities related to birth.

Method A hospital based retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary Government-run hospital specializing in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and all deliveries conducted from Jan 1 st 2009 to Dec 31 st 2009 were included, the data was collected using a pro forma designed based on the recommendations for routine reporting on caesarean delivery in developing countries. ResultsThere were 7543 deliveries in the study period with 1756 being CS, giving a rate of 23. 27 %. Most of the CSs were performed because of a previous CS. <b>Foetal</b> distress, breech <b>presentation</b> and failed induction were the other prominent indications. Placenta praevia and malpresentations were the most important absolute Indications of CS.

40|$|Using {{orthogonal}} design, {{we created}} a questionnaire containing 16 cases of twin pregnancies. For each case, respondents indicated whether they would plan a vaginal delivery (VD) or a caesarean section (CS). We assessed the association between each variable (maternal age, parity, mode of conception, gestational age, chorionicity, body mass index, foetal growth, <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> and wish for additional children) and the planned mode of delivery. A VD was planned mostly for vertex presentation of twin A (vertex-vertex vs. non-vertex-vertex, odds ratio [OR]: 0. 002, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 001 - 0. 003, p < 0. 001). For vertex- non-vertex (vs. vertex-vertex) presentation, chances on planning a VD decreased threefold (OR: 0. 29, 95 % CI: 0. 018 - 0. 46, p < 0. 001), {{although the majority of}} respondents would still plan a VD. In multiparous (vs. nulliparous) women, VD was chosen more often (OR: 3. 24, 95 % CI: 2. 50 - 4. 18, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Basic Antenatal Care (BANC) {{is a way}} of {{training}} or upgrading the knowledge and skills of all nurses, midwives and doctors involved in antenatal care at the primary health care level so that the minimum care can be provided effectively. This study was conducted to investigate the implementation of the BANC program by midwives in the Mdantsane clinics during February 2009. Methods: A descriptive study design was undertaken targeting midwives providing antenatal care to pregnant women, in 14 clinics of Mdantsane. Data was collected from 25 midwives in the clinics, and from 140 ANC cards of women attending ANC on the day of their visit to the clinic. Results: The majority of midwives providing BANC in Mdantsane clinics were not trained in BANC. There were 10 trained midwives and 15 not yet trained. A total of twenty five midwives were involved in the study. The number of visits according to the BANC schedule was well known by the midwives in the study. The content of the visits was well known for the first visit, but for subsequent visits, the participating midwives could not state exactly what they do on these visits. They perceived BANC as something beneficial for both midwives and pregnant women with 24 of the participating midwives rating BANC as advantageous. In completing an ANC card, the midwives scored between 48 percent and 100 percent. Under examination, they scored between 52 percent and 100 percent. Lastly on interpretation and decision making, they scored between 0 percent and 92 percent. This could have troubling consequences for the health status of the mother and baby. Weaknesses in providing antenatal care identified in the study included participating midwives failing to fill in the last normal menstrual period (LNMP) and the estimated date of delivery (EDD), which was a worrying observation. Plotting of the gestational age at first visit was also not carried out well as only 47 percent of the midwives in the study did this, meaning {{that there would be a}} miscalculation of the gestational age thereafter throughout the pregnancies. The body mass index (BMI) was not calculated as the maternal height and weight were not written on the ANC card. This should be completed in order to check the nutritional status of the pregnant woman to help supplement, if malnourished, and educate on diet, if overweight. Only 17 percent of the midwives in the study plotted the <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation.</b> Failure to plot <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> could lead to complications during delivery because women with abnormal presentations could end up delivering in a clinic instead of the hospital. Conclusion: This study showed that even though midwives are implementing BANC among pregnant women, it is not being carried out correctly. Therefore the programme will not be as beneficial as it would be if put into practice correctly. This is highlighted by the lack of knowledge from the untrained midwives regarding the content of care on subsequent visits. Thus there is an urgent need for BANC training to be conducted and monitored at various sites...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{capacity}} of pre-induction sonographic assessment of occipital position of the foetal head to predict the outcome of delivery, and to assess whether sonographic foetal head position before induction of labour is related to <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> at delivery. Study design: A prospective cohort {{study was conducted in}} the Maxima Medical Centre, The Netherlands. We included consecutive women in whom labour was induced. Immediately prior to induction a transabdominal ultrasound was performed to determine the position of the foetal occiput. The primary outcome was mode of delivery. We recorded maternal demographics, labour and delivery characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes. The association between position of the foetal head before induction of labour and the occurrence of caesarean section was addressed using univariable and logistic regression analysis. Results: From the 50 of the 183 foetuses that started labour in occipitoposterior position, 11 persisted in occipitoposterior position until birth, whereas from the 120 foetuses that were in occipitoanterior position before induction, three children were born in an occipitoposterior position. Although we found a difference in caesarean section rate between OP position and OA position of the foetal head at sonography prior to induction, this was not statistically significant (14 % versus 6. 7 %, OR 2. 3, 95 % Cl 0. 78 - 6. 7).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between maternal thyrotrophin (TSH) and breech presentation at term. DESIGN: Combined data sets of two prospective studies to obtain adequate epidemiological power. PATIENTS: One thousand and fifty-eight healthy pregnant women (58 breech, 1000 cephalic) and 131 women who presented in breech at an obstetrical outpatient clinic. MEASUREMENTS: Maternal thyroid parameters [TSH, free thyroid hormone (FT 4), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) ] and <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> were assessed in both groups between 35 and 38 weeks gestation. Power calculations suggested that at least 148 breech cases were required. RESULTS: The characteristics {{of the women in}} breech in both samples were similar. Women in breech (n = 58 + 131) had significantly higher TSH (but not FT 4) than those (n = 1000) with cephalic presentation (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0 · 003). Different cut-offs were used to define high TSH in the 916 TPO-Ab-negative women with cephalic presentation: the 90 th, 95 th and 97 · 5 th percentiles were 2 · 4 mIU/l (n = 149), 2 · 7 mIU/l (n = 77) and 3 · 2 mIU/l (n = 37).

40|$|Recent {{papers on}} {{monitoring}} {{of health services}} affirmed that while antenatal care (ANC) is an effective measure, quality is still a problem. Quality in maternal services "…involves providing a minimum level of care to all pregnant women…" Yet adherence to a minimum level of recommended ANC content appears to be unmet. Comprehensive review of ANC content rendered in environments with rapid changes in demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and morbidity was sparse. Malaysia is such {{a country that has}} undergone these transitions with tremendous progress in health. However, recent progress in pregnancy outcomes is stagnating. This study aims to analyse adherence to recommended ANC; specifically, to examine the extent of adherence to recommended ANC content and to determine the factors influencing ANC content score. A retrospective cohort study of 522 randomly selected women who used ANC was conducted. Data were extracted from individual records. The study examined adherence to essential ANC guidelines using weighted scoring for physical examination, health screening, case management, and health education. GLM Univariate analysis procedure was used to determine the factors associated with ANC content score. Binary logistic regression was used to assess ANC content level and pregnancy outcomes, controlled for ANC utilisation. Around half of the women had < 80 % of recommended ANC content documented. Health education had the lowest mean score, at around 35 %. The low-risk pregnancies had a higher ANC content score than the high-risk pregnancies (78 % vs. 75 %; P = 0. 002). The smallest clinics had a higher ANC content score than the bigger clinics (78 % vs. 74 - 76 %; P< 0. 001). ANC content score among the women with "adequate" ANC utilisation, as defined by the modified Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilisation Index, was lower than the women with "adequate-plus" ANC utilisation (75 % vs. 78 %, P< 0. 001). Assessment of symphysis-fundal height, <b>foetal</b> <b>presentation</b> and foetal heart auscultation were initiated earlier than recommended. Inadequate ANC content was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth. Our findings indicate the presence of issues related to delivery of recommended ANC content.
