Such a network would provide the support required for an action group seeking {{the highest level of}} identity, autonomy and initiative" [...] and the examined question was to know if the Bitcoin protocol can morph into Virtual Collective Consciousness. The Byzantine generals problem was used as an analogy to understand the behavioral complexity of the community of Bitcoin's users.|$|E
40|$|Permisionless <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledgers</b> ("blockchains") {{such as the}} one {{underlying}} the cryptocurrency Bitcoin allow anonymous participants to maintain the ledger, while avoiding control or "censorship" by any single entity. In contrast, permissioned <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledgers</b> exploit real-world trust and accountability, allowing only explicitly authorized parties to maintain the ledger. Permissioned ledgers support more flexible governance and a wider choice of consensus mechanisms. Both kinds of <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledgers</b> may be susceptible to manipulation by participants who favor some transactions over others. The real-world accountability underlying permissioned ledgers provides an opportunity to impose fairness constraints that can be enforced by penalizing violators after-the- fact. To date, however, this opportunity has not been fully exploited, unnecessarily leaving participants latitude to manipulate outcomes undetectably. This paper draws attention to this issue, and proposes design principles to make such manipulation more difficult, as well as specific mechanisms {{to make it easier to}} detect when violations occur...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} internet-based digital {{currency}} platform based on <b>decentralized</b> public <b>ledgers</b> have started since {{the introduction of}} the blockchain concept by the founder of Bitcoin in 2008. An important element of these public ledger platforms is an incentive system that elicits efforts from a distributed global workforce to verify and record transactions on the public ledger and a governance system for the platform. The economic efficiency and possibly viability of a public ledger platform ultimately depend on the design of these incentive and governance systems. Even if a <b>decentralized</b> public <b>ledger</b> were a more efficient technology for conducting financial transactions, and for providing a platform for distributed innovation, deficiencies in its incentive and governance systems could make it overall inferior to alternatives, including existing systems. Current claims that public ledger platforms can conduct financial transactions more efficiently ignore the inefficiencies associated with the incentive and governance systems and the likely costs associated with regulation of these platforms and complementary service providers such as vaults, wallets, and exchanges. It is possible that public ledger platforms are more efficient than other alternative platforms for conducing financial transactions, but as of now the proposition is based on apples-to-oranges comparisons compounded with speculation. Competition will lead to better incentive and governance systems for public ledger platforms...|$|R
30|$|Supply-chain finance {{involves}} an extensive amount of manual inspections and paper-based transactions. The process also has numerous intermediaries, {{a high risk}} of illegal transactions, high costs, and low efficiency. Blockchain technology can drastically reduce manual interventions and employ smart contracts in order to digitize procedures that rely heavily on paperwork. This would greatly improve the efficiency of supply-chain finance and reduce manual operational risks. With the supplier, buyer, and bank as the main trading parties, and the sharing of contractual information on a <b>decentralized</b> distributed <b>ledger,</b> smart contracts can ensure that payments are made automatically once a predetermined time and result is reached.|$|R
30|$|Decentralization is the {{presiding}} feature of distributed ledger systems like Bitcoin. This feature, which contracts with other modern systems, are overseen by intermediaries. For example, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) {{is central to}} the global payment system, such as, commercial banks for credit markets and central banks for monetary markets. All these centers prominent in other systems exert what is reasonably called political power, but Bitcoin functions without them. Bitcoin’s supporters embrace the network’s decentralization and have been proposing more aggressive formats such as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bannon 2016). A <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledger</b> can be maintained by a proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism and reward incentive engineering. POW requires that nodes engage in mining to report verified blocks. This mining process consumes energy, time, and capital, but it prohibits malicious and penalty-free reporting.|$|E

40|$|After {{more than}} six years from the launch of Bitcoin, it has become ev-ident that the <b>decentralized</b> {{transaction}} <b>ledger</b> functionality implemented through the blockchain technology can be used not only for cryptocur-rencies, but to register, confirm and transfer any kind of contract and property. In this work we analyze the most relevant functionalities and known issues of this technology, with the intent of pointing out the pos-sible behaviours that are not as efficient as they should when thinking with a broader outlook. Our analysis would be the starting point for the introduction of a new approach to blockchain creation and management, which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper. ...|$|R

Blockchain has the following characteristics: a distributed <b>ledger,</b> <b>decentralized</b> data management, data security, transparency and integrity, anti-tampering and anti-forgery, high efficiency, low cost, and no risk of a centralized database failure. In addition, blockchain’s programmable features increase flexibility and reliability in different application scenarios.|$|R

40|$|Anonymous {{credentials}} {{provide a}} powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today’s anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer — which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e. g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility. In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash and uses techniques — such as the calculation of a distributed transaction ledger — that are currently in widespread deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledger</b> and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|Temporary work is an {{employment}} situation useful and suitable in all occasions in which business needs to adjust more easily and quickly to workload fluctuations or maintain staffing flexibility. Temporary workers play therefore {{an important role}} in many companies, but this kind of activity is subject to a special form of legal protections and many aspects and risks {{must be taken into account}} both employers and employees. In this work we propose a blockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all actors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with the fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a protection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system wants to assist the employer in processing contracts with a fully automated and fast procedure. To resolve these problems we propose the D-ES (Decentralized Employment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state system. Then we describe the enabling technology that makes us able to realize the D-ES. In facts, we propose the implementation of a DLT (<b>Decentralized</b> <b>Ledger</b> Technology) based system, consisting in a blockchain system and of a web-based environment. Thanks the decentralized application platforms that makes us able to develop smart contracts, we define a discrete event control system that works inside the blockchain. In addition, we discuss the temporary work in agriculture as a interesting case of study.

40|$|The Dutch electoral {{voting system}} is {{designed}} {{in a way that}} does not fit in the current era of the digital transformation. Almost every procedure during the elections is done manually and change in policy is very difficult as it requires a change in legislation. This thesis explores a more trustworthy, transparent and less expensive way of verifying the suffrage of a citizen. In order to accomplish this, a literature review is presented about the election process in other countries and new possibilities with state of the art technology are reviewed. Based on these investigations, a solution that would make the current voting pass superfluous is presented. The presented solution in this thesis is built with blockchain and machine readable travel documents. Considering blockchain, this technology is a <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledger</b> of transactions, where every transaction is immutable and built following predefined rules. These transactions are visible and verifiable for anyone connected to the decentralized network. Due to this decentralized design, the network is resilient against DDoS attacks and has no single point of failure. Machine readable travel documents are used for the authentication. Dutch travel documents (passports, identity cards and driver’s licences) are designed according to the ICAO machine readable travel document standard, which also requires the presence of a biometric chip. This means that every citizen already has access to a PKI (public key infrastructure) key pair, which can be used to sign data. The presented solution combines these technologies and is first of its kind to link a machine readable travel document to a blockchain. These new possibilities can help solving the identity problem for all kinds of organization...|$|E

40|$|To build a safe {{system that}} would {{replicate}} and perhaps transcend human-level intelligence, a system composed of three basic modules: objective, agent, and perception is proposed for development. An objective module would make sure the system acts in humanity's interest, not against them and would have two components: a network of machine learning agents and a cryptographic ledger. The network of agents would benefit from a form of semiotics, known as deconstruction {{to address the problem}} of value alignment. A <b>decentralized</b> cryptographic <b>ledger</b> to propose a mechanism to mitigate the existential threat such a system would pose to humanity. To build the agent module that would act intelligently on the world, the concept of Dyna would benefit from a treatise in sociology to build up the theoretical framework needed for the missing link of artificial general intelligence - the world simulator. A perception module that would estimate the state of the world, would benefit from existing deep learning algorithms enhanced by a new paradigm in hardware design - a quantum computer. This paper describes a way of how such a system could be built, analyzing the current state of the art and providing rather alternative directions for research than concrete, industry-ready solutions.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} mobile {{edge applications}} are generating intense traffic and posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resource sharing across multiple service providers {{can be a}} way to maximize the utilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status. Moreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocation fairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest. We propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge application placement decisions for multiple service providers. We first formulate a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for mobile edge application placement scenarios. Based on our model, we present a heuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm. As a <b>decentralized</b> public <b>ledger,</b> the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as the smart contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hosts participating in the system. The algorithm is agreed by all parties and the results will only be accepted by majority of the mining nodes on the blockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting the consumer's latency and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost. All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by every mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes resources at the mobile edge.

40|$|Blockchain {{technology}} has been raising enthusiasm over a variety of disciplines, from information technology and finance, to law and economics. Blockchain is a <b>decentralized</b> <b>ledger,</b> which facilitates trust and makes peer-to-peer transactions possible without a central third-party authority. Since 2008, cryptocurrency bitcoin has provided {{an example of how}} to implement a marketplace without a central authority by using blockchain technology. The fact that a broad range of economic and government activities rely on a centralized recording of the basic data of the economy makes this technology potentially significant. The utopian views of blockchain have argued that it will disrupt a wide range of markets by eliminating the need for intermediation. The objective of this thesis is to review the relevant literature related to the topic and provide a guide to what blockchain means in the field of economics. The published research is mapped through a three stage literature review, and based on this, it is organized in three main categories: monetary-, innovation- and governance-centred research. Even though the literature surrounding the topic is still in its infancy, the potential of blockchain technologies is recognized by the literature. From the monetary viewpoint blockchain gives unprecedented flexibility in designing the attributes of currencies in terms of supply, value and exchange. From the innovation viewpoint, blockchain can create both increased efficiency of existing markets but also profits through entirely new markets. From the governance viewpoint blockchain facilitates trust and can be instrumental in democratizing economy more towards peer-to-peer production and consumption. Rather than a single technology, blockchain should be understood {{as a part of a}} greater digital transformation. In this case, blockchain can play a role in unlocking the potential of digital commons as well as the sharing and platform economy through a decentralized, universal record-keeping system...|$|E

30|$|Equity {{crowdfunding}} via the Internet is a {{new channel}} of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a <b>decentralized</b> and distributed <b>ledger</b> technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems {{in the practice of}} equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The MyData is concept {{framework}} {{that refers to}} human-centric ways of personal data management. Personal data gained significant attention recently. As the developing of Ubicomp technology, more and more particularly personal data are generating and collecting. Personal data own increasingly important economic, social, and practical value. However, individuals {{have little or no}} power to control when and how their data being created or processed by companies, organizations or governments. The MyData aim to provide individuals with practical methods to obtain, access, and utilize their personal datasets and to encourage organizations to give users control over their personal data. In this way, access and trade personal data can expect to build an open data market. Two challenges to achieve this goal is how to gain the individuals trust and permission and how to provide a more human-centric way to support personal data management and utilization. To explore a novel and reliable way to address the challenges in MyData, this thesis utilizes blockchain technology to support MyData framework. Blockchain is a <b>decentralized</b> transparent <b>ledger</b> with the transaction information that shared among all peer-to-peer network nodes. It has the potential to gain users trust and provide a solution to gain users permission in data trade. This thesis work focuses on studying blockchain and smart contract performance in MyData architecture. An Ethereum blockchain based MyData system that combined AWARE platform designed and implemented. The system deploys smart contract that provides users’ account management, personal data access, trade services, and information inquiry services in the Ethereum blockchain. Based on this system, two experiments designed to evaluate the performance of the integrated MyData system. The experiments results demonstrate how blockchain can facilitate MyData concept and how gas price influences the system performance. The thesis work shows that the blockchain and smart contract have the potential to provide the necessary technology support to solve the challenge in gain users’ trust and permission and support new business models and open data market to benefit both the data consumer and data producer. Additionally, blockchain and the smart contract can provide a more fine-grained and transparent way to help individuals to manage and utilize their personal data...|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{revolution of}} digital and online computing {{combined with the}} information revolution {{paved the way for}} the emergence of innovations to reshape existing industries and the way we think about traditional services. Even one of the most traditional industries, the financial sector, is being actively disrupted through fintech and the sharing economy. Innovations such as mobile banking, peer-to-peer lending or crowdfunding are challenging existing models and practices. This paper aims to show that blockchain technology has the potential to transform equity markets by offering valuable opportunities to create new products to overcome existing inefficiencies and frictions. The blockchain was first introduced as the technology behind the bitcoin cryptocurrency, and is a trustless, <b>decentralized</b> and secure <b>ledger.</b> It provides an unprecedented way to monitor and execute transactions with no need for intermediaries, and to keep a tamper-proof record of these transactions. This breakthrough technology has gradually gained traction and is now being explored far beyond the scope of bitcoin projects.
