Then the topological optimization method was used to optimize the <b>fixing</b> <b>plank</b> so as {{to find out the}} best bearing structure. In the end，fixing plank was further improved and designed for a second time in Solidworks. According to the comparison of the finite element analyze results before and after the topological optimization, the weight of the <b>fixing</b> <b>plank</b> reduced by 30 % while the {{stress and strain}} nearly keep the same...|$|R

60|$|The besiegers had {{suffered}} much more severely, great numbers having {{been killed by}} the stones and missiles hurled down by the defenders while engaged in the demolition of the walls. At nightfall the Danes carried off their wounded and recrossed the river, confident that next day they would succeed in their assault. As soon as darkness had set in Count Eudes collected the citizens, and these, bearing beams and planks, crossed the bridge to the tower, and set to work. Outside the circle of ruins holes were dug and the beams securely <b>fixed.</b> <b>Planks</b> were nailed to these, and earth heaped up behind them.|$|R
5000|$|KAPLA {{requires}} no glue, no screws and no clips to <b>fix</b> the <b>planks.</b> Each plank is simply placed {{one on top}} of the other. The planks are held in place by gravity and balance alone. You can use Kapla planks in 3 different ways: ...|$|R
60|$|Sterne, meditating on the embarrassments of that stupidity, forgot himself completely. His stony, unwinking stare was <b>fixed</b> on the <b>planks</b> of the deck.|$|R

60|$|After {{a careful}} examination, they <b>fixed</b> upon a <b>plank</b> to operate upon, and, leaving {{one of the}} irons there, {{so that they could}} find it in the dark, they lay down to sleep, or sat talking until it was dark. Before this, a glance, through the peephole, showed them that the hatch had been placed over the {{hatchway}} of the next hold, so that there was little fear of anyone coming down, unless something special was required.|$|R
5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually <b>fix</b> wood <b>planks</b> to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe that}} the primary {{influence}} of the quap upon us was to increase the conductivity of our nerves, {{but that is a}} mere unjustifiable speculation on my part. At any rate it gave a sort of east wind effect to life. We all became irritable, clumsy, languid and disposed to be impatient with our languor. We moored the brig to the rocks with difficulty, and got aground on mud and decided to stick there and tow off when we had done--the bottom was as greasy as butter. Our efforts to <b>fix</b> up <b>planks</b> and sleepers in order to wheel the quap aboard were as ill-conceived as that sort of work can be--and that sort of work can at times be very ill-conceived. The captain had a superstitious fear of his hold: he became wildly gesticulatory and expository and incompetent at the bare thought of it. His shouts still echo in my memory, becoming as each crisis approached less and less like any known tongue.|$|R
30|$|Metod b: 4.5  g of {{cellulose}} pulp were placed inside a 60  mm plastic Petri capsule {{on the bottom}} of which 4 small holes were previously done; 28  g of deionised water (0.1 μS) were added in situ and the capsule, <b>fixed</b> by wooden <b>planks</b> and springs, was placed on the wall. The capsule was removed after 24  h. Salt re-extraction from the cellulose pulp was performed, in laboratory, by three successive extractions with deionised water (0.1 μS) using 200  ml in total. After each extraction the cellulose suspension was filtered using a MilliQ apparatus and a 0.45  μm acetate filter, the three solutions were then mixed and analysed.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the coming}} of the Europeans from 1860 onwards, the Lozi people of Barotseland were {{building}} Nalikwanda royal barges made from teak <b>planks</b> <b>fixed</b> with iron nails (extensive Rhodesian Teak forests grew in the east of Barotseland). As seen in the Kuomboka ceremony these reached huge sizes, requiring a hundred paddlers or more. Although there has been speculation that the Lozi learnt this method of boat building from Arab or Portuguese traders, the Lozi did not allow such traders to enter their territory, and the traders certainly did not haul boats overland to central Africa with them. There is no evidence to suppose that the Lozi plank boat is anything other than an indigenous technology.|$|R
50|$|Rib - A {{thin strip}} of pliable timber laid athwart-wise inside the hull, from inwale to inwale, at regular close {{intervals}} {{to strengthen the}} exterior planking. The rib is often steamed to increase flexibility. The rib is traditionally <b>fixed</b> to the <b>planking</b> by rivets or copper nails bent over on the inside. This method is still used in small clinker built dinghies and similar craft. Ribs are attached after the planking is constructed. Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed we do," [...] {{returned}} the hermit, [...] "and we are fitted out for longish voyages and rough weather. Besides, {{it is not}} so much of an eggshell as you suppose. I made it myself, and took care that it should be fit for the work required of it. The wood of which it is made, although light, is very tough, and it is lined with a skin of strong canvas which is <b>fixed</b> to the <b>planks</b> with tar. This makes the craft watertight as well as strong. The ribs also are very light and close together, and every sixth rib is larger and longer than the others and made of tougher wood. All these ribs are bound together by longitudinal pieces, or laths, of very tough wood, yet so thin that the whole machine is elastic without being weak. Besides this, there are two strong oiled-canvas partitions, which divide the canoe into three watertight compartments, any two of which will float it if the third should get filled." ...|$|R
60|$|Over this chamber, which {{contained}} what his soul longed after, {{and over the}} president's rooms, there ran a set of unoccupied garrets, into which the dexterous Cartouche penetrated. These were divided from the rooms below, according to the fashion of those days, {{by a set of}} large beams, which reached across the whole building, and across which rude planks were laid, which formed the ceiling of the lower story and the floor of the upper. Some of these planks did young Cartouche remove; and having descended by means of a rope, tied a couple of others to the neck of the honey-pots, climbed back again, and drew up his prey in safety. He then cunningly <b>fixed</b> the <b>planks</b> again in their old places, and retired to gorge himself upon his booty. And, now, see the punishment of avarice! Everybody knows that the brethren of the order of Jesus are bound by a vow to have no more than a certain small sum of money in their possession. The principal of the college of Clermont had amassed a larger sum, in defiance of this rule: and where do you think the old gentleman had hidden it? In the honey-pots! As Cartouche dug his spoon into one of them, he brought out, besides a quantity of golden honey, a couple of golden louis, which, with ninety-eight more of their fellows, were comfortably hidden in the pots. Little Dominic, who, before, had cut rather a poor figure among his fellow-students, now appeared in as fine clothes as any of them could boast of; and when asked by his parents, on going home, how he came by them, said that a young nobleman of his schoolfellows had taken a violent fancy to him, and made him a present of a couple of his suits. Cartouche the elder, good man, went to thank the young nobleman; but none such could be found, and young Cartouche disdained to give any explanation of his manner of gaining the money.|$|R
6000|$|To mournful ditties, Clio, change thy note, Since cruel fate {{has sunk}} our Justice Boat; Why should he sink, where nothing seem'd to press His lading little, and his ballast less? Tost {{in the waves}} of this tempestuous world, At length, his anchor fix'd and canvass furl'd, To Lazy-hill[1] {{retiring}} from his court, At his Ring's end[2] he founders in the port. With water[3] fill'd, {{he could no longer}} float, The common death of many a stronger boat. A post so fill'd on nature's laws entrenches: Benches on boats are placed, not boats on benches. And yet our Boat (how shall I reconcile it?) Was both a Boat, and in one sense a pilot. With every wind he sail'd, and well could tack: Had many pendants, but abhorr'd a Jack.[4] He's gone, although his friends began to hope, That he might yet be lifted by a rope. [...] Behold the awful bench, on which he sat! He was as hard and ponderous wood as that: Yet when his sand was out, we find at last, That death has overset him with a blast. Our Boat is now sail'd to the Stygian ferry, There to supply old Charon's leaky wherry; Charon in him will ferry souls to Hell; A trade our Boat[5] has practised here so well: And Cerberus has ready in his paws Both pitch and brimstone, to fill up his flaws. Yet, spite of death and fate, I here maintain We may place Boat in his old post again. The way is thus: and well deserves your thanks: Take the three strongest of his broken <b>planks,</b> <b>Fix</b> them on high, conspicuous to be seen, Form'd like the triple tree near Stephen's Green:[6] And, when we view it thus with thief at end on't, We'll cry; look, here's our Boat, and there's the pendant.|$|R
