25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{how many people were}} in the ranks of the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World black-winged stilt {{by the white}} spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E

25|$|The art of Eastern Catholicism {{has always}} been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in {{countries}} near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The Black Madonna of Częstochowa {{may well have been}} of Byzantine origin - it has been repainted and this <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the Salus Populi Romani and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.|$|E
25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white on the dog. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.|$|E
25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E

25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See Phaistos Disc decipherment claims).|$|E
500|$|As a {{homage to}} Lewis, Azaria {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the [...] "Treehouse of [...] " [...] segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Frink and his father's voices apart: [...] "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes hard to tell which one of the two nutty professors is talking." [...] In addition, The Knoxville News-Sentinels Terry Morrow commented that [...] "to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard Simpsons fans live for." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Tom Martin said in Ortved's {{book that}} he does not {{understand}} the criticism against Scully because he thinks Scully ran the show well. He also commented that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single show runner for lowering the quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] He also wrote that some of the episodes from Scully's first two seasons (nine and ten), such as [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] and [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", are better than certain episodes of the two previous seasons.|$|E

500|$|Writing in the International Times, Barry Miles found [...] "Piggies" [...] "unsubtle" [...] {{and likely}} to appeal to [...] "those {{involved}} with Chicago's pig-police". William Mann of The Times noted the recurring nature theme throughout the album, from brief mentions of monkeys, lizards, elephants and tigers, to song titles such as [...] "Blackbird" [...] and [...] "Piggies", and asked of Harrison's characters: [...] "are they Chicago police or just company directors?" [...] Melody Makers Alan Walsh admired the instrumentation on the recording and deemed [...] "Piggies" [...] to be [...] "The Beatles' satire track … a kick at upper-class reactionaries or journalists (or both)". In his unfavourable review of the White Album, in The New York Times, Mike Jahn considered {{that many of the}} tracks were [...] "either so corny or sung {{in such a way that}} it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether [...] are being serious", among which the words of Harrison's song served as [...] "an act of lyrical overstatement".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, Scully's {{tenure as}} showrunner of The Simpsons {{has been the}} subject of {{criticism}} from the show's fans. John Ortved wrote [...] "Scully's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays, but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg." [...] The BBC noted [...] "the common consensus is that The Simpsons golden era ended after season nine", while an op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued The Simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during Scully's years. The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labelled as a [...] "gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation" [...] by Jon Bonné of MSNBC, while some fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf", dubbing him [...] "Jerkass Homer". Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how much of the decline is Scully's fault, and that blaming a single showrunner for lowering the quality of the show [...] "is unfair." ...|$|E

2500|$|Losey {{became a}} major figure in New York {{political}} theatre, first directing the controversial failure Little Old Boy in 1933. He declined to direct a staged version of Dodsworth by Sinclair Lewis, which led Lewis to offer him his first work written for the stage, Jayhawker. Losey directed the show, which had a brief run. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times noted that [...] "The play, being increasingly wordy, presents staging problems that Joe Losey's direction does not always solve. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{who is responsible for}} the obscure parts in the story." ...|$|E

[...] As such it was not a definitive document, and nothing in it was either [...] "accepted" [...] or [...] "rejected" [...] by the Church. [...] However, journalists saw in the voting figures a strong indication of where the fault lines had been in 2014 and may be again in 2015, although it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how many voted no because they saw the text as too bold, and how many did so because they saw it as not bold enough.|$|E
2500|$|Published in 2004 by Random House, Dark Age Ahead posits Jacobs' {{argument}} that [...] "North American" [...] civilization {{shows signs of}} a spiral decline comparable {{to the collapse of}} the Roman empire. Her discussion focuses on [...] "five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm," [...] which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community; quality in education; free thought in science; representational government and responsible taxes; and corporate and professional accountability. As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: [...] "At a given time it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture? Arguably, either {{could turn out to be}} true." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Richard Nixon made an unannounced {{visit to}} Xenia {{a few days}} later. It {{would be the first}} (and only) city {{affected}} by the 1974 Super Outbreak that he would visit. Upon inspecting the damage, he said: [...] "As I look back over the disasters, I saw the earthquake in Anchorage in 1964; I saw the hurricanes... Hurricane Camille in 1969 down in Mississippi, and I saw Hurricane Agnes in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. And it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the difference among them all, but I would say in terms of destruction, just total devastation, this is the worst I have seen." [...] President Nixon immediately declared Xenia a disaster area. Although the Federal Disaster Relief Act was already introduced in 1973, it still had not passed Congress. The 1974 Super Outbreak disaster was a catalyst for accelerated passage of the act through Congress in 1974, according to Nixon. It took several months for the city to recover from the tornado, {{with the help of the}} Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard assisting the recovery efforts. Most of the town was quickly re-built afterward. In recognition of their coverage of the tornado under difficult circumstances, the staff of the Xenia Daily Gazette won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975. The Xenia tornado was one of two rated F5 that affected Ohio during the outbreak, the other striking the Cincinnati area (see Cincinnati/Sayler Park area tornado, below). [...] Xenia was later struck by two other tornadoes—both a smaller one in April 1989 and a larger one in September 2000, which was an F4 twister that killed one and injured about 100 in an area parallel to and just north of the 1974 path. Before the 1974 storm, the city had no tornado sirens. After the F5 tornado hit on April 3, 1974, ten sirens were installed across the area.|$|E
