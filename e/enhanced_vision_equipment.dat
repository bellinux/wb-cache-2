40|$|Night <b>vision</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is crucial}} in order to {{accomplish}} supremacy and safety of the troops on the battlefield. Evidently, system integrators, ministry of defenses and end-users need access to reliable quantitative characterization of the expected field performance when using night <b>vision</b> <b>equipment.</b> The image intensifier tube {{is one of the most}} important engines driving the performance for night <b>vision</b> <b>equipment.</b> As a major tube manufacturer, Photonis investigates the link between its products physical design parameters and the actual end-user field performance. The developments include (1) an end-to-end performance measurement method and test facility, (2) an image-based night vision simulation, and (3) a range estimation model. The purpose is twofold: (1) being able to support the need of the integrators and end-users and (2) further systematic improvement of night <b>vision</b> <b>equipment</b> design. For the end-to-end test, Photonis and TNO cooperated in the implementation of the triangle orientation discrimination (TOD) test for night <b>vision</b> <b>equipment.</b> This test provides a clear and rigorous ranking of the products with respect to their target acquisition performance level. We present the Photonis night vision test laboratory, provide TOD results for a set of night vision devices, and show range prediction examples...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> {{systems in}} civil {{aircraft}} {{is projected to}} increase rapidly as the Federal Aviation Administration recently changed the aircraft operating rules under Part 91, revising the flight visibility requirements for conducting approach and landing operations. Operators conducting straight-in instrument approach procedures may now operate below the published approach minimums when using an approved <b>enhanced</b> flight <b>vision</b> system that shows the required visual references on the pilot's Head-Up Display. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the complementary use of synthetic <b>vision</b> systems and <b>enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> system technologies, focusing on new techniques for integration and/or fusion of synthetic and <b>enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> technologies and crew resource management while operating under these newly adopted rules.

A piloted simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the complementary use of Synthetic and <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vision</b> technologies. Specific focus was placed on new techniques for integration and/or fusion of <b>Enhanced</b> and Synthetic <b>Vision</b> and its impact within a two-crew flight deck during low-visibility approach and landing operations. Overall, the experimental data showed that significant improvements in situation awareness, without concomitant increases in workload and display clutter, could be provided by the integration and/or fusion of synthetic and <b>enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> technologies for the pilot-flying and the pilot-not-flying. Improvements in lateral path control performance were realized when the Head-Up Display concepts included a tunnel, independent of the imagery (<b>enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> or fusion of <b>enhanced</b> and synthetic <b>vision)</b> presented with it. During non-normal operations, the ability of the crew to handle substantial navigational errors and runway incursions were neither improved nor adversely impacted by the display concepts.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{projects}} {{have been developed to}} increase flight safety and economy of aviation. The development and validation of systems for pilot assistance is also one field of interest. To improve the situational awareness of an aircrew during poor visibility, different approaches emerged during the past few years. <b>Enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> systems (EVS – based on sensor images) are one of those. Typically, <b>Enhanced</b> <b>vision</b> systems consist of two main parts- sensor vision and Synthetic vision. Sensor vision uses weather penetrating forward looking image sensors such as Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) and HiVision Millimeter Wave Radar (HiVision MMWR). The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} set up the procedure based on literature survey to model the HiVision Millimeter Wave Radar for <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vision</b> Systems functionalities...|$|R
