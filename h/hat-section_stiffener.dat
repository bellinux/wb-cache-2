40|$|The use of {{prefabricated}} pultruded carbon-epoxy rods {{has reduced}} the manufacturing complexity and costs of stiffened composite panels while increasing the damage tolerance of the panels. However, repairability of these highly efficient discrete stiffeners has been a concern. Design, analysis, and test results are {{presented in this paper}} for a bolted-joint repair for the pultruded rod concept that is capable of efficiently transferring axial loads in a <b>hat-section</b> <b>stiffener</b> on the upper skin segment of a heavily loaded aircraft wing component. A tension and a compression joint design were evaluated. The tension joint design achieved approximately 1. 0 % strain in the carbon-epoxy rod-reinforced hat-section and failed in a metal fitting at 166 % of the design ultimate load. The compression joint design failed in the carbon-epoxy rod-reinforced hat-section test specimen area at approximately 0. 7 % strain and at 110 % of the design ultimate load. This strain level of 0. 7 % in compression is similar to the failure strain observed in previously reported carbon-epoxy rod-reinforced hat-section column tests...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on 247 panels with Z-section stiffeners and 304 panels with <b>hat-section</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> Specimens were constructed from artificially aged Alclad 24 S aluminum alloy with minimum guaranteed yield strengths of 64 and 57 ksi for stiffeners and sheet materials, respectively. Height, thickness, and spacing of stiffeners, sheet thickness, and length of specimens were varied systematically to show effects of changes in these dimensions on panel strength. Results show average stresses at buckling load and maximum load...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for {{a part of}} a test program on 24 S-T aluminum alloy flat compression panels with longitudinal formed <b>hat-section</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> This part of the program is concerned with panels in which the thickness of the stiffener materials is 0. 625 times the skin thickness. The results, presented in tabular and graphical form, show the effect of the relative dimensions of the panel on the buckling stress and the average stress at maximum load. Comparative envelope curves {{are presented}} for hat-stiffened and Z-stiffened panels having the same ratio of stiffener thickness to sheet thickness. These curves provide some indication of the relative structural efficiencies of the two types of panel...|$|R
