5|$|The deleted scenes {{included}} on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired. In the first, a minute-long clip, Ron tries {{to take a job}} offer that was previously offered to him at an Internet flower company web site, but when he finds the business <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> poorly, he sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In a second minute-long clip, Leslie talks about her very detailed life plan, which involves eventually becoming head of the parks department, then governor of Indiana, then U.S. vice president and then getting married at age 84. The deleted clips were featured on the Parks and Recreation official website within a week of the episode's original production date.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from {{erstwhile}} Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses {{on the night of}} the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father while we see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a tenant}} {{adversely}} possesses land, {{there is a}} presumption that he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> {{in a way that}} will benefit his landlord at the end of his term. If the land does not belong to his landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the reversion. If the land does belong to his landlord, it would seem that it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of his term.|$|E

For instance, the coefficient of thermal expansion of a certain brass alloy, α=18.7ppm/°C, may {{be expressed}} as 18.7(µm/m)/°C, or as 18.7(µin/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure. Similarly, a metering pump that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate Qp=125ppm, <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> at a rate that may {{be expressed in}} a variety of volumetric units, including 125µL/L, 125µgal/gal, 125cm3/m3, etc.|$|E
25|$|Edmund betrays Gloucester to Cornwall, Regan and Goneril. He reveals {{evidence}} {{that his father}} knows of an impending French invasion designed to reinstate Lear to the throne; and in fact a French army has landed in Britain. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall gouge out Gloucester's eyes. As he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> a servant is overcome with rage by what he is witnessing and attacks Cornwall, mortally wounding him. Regan kills the servant, and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath too.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E

25|$|Originally a {{city the}} {{industry}} of which focused mainly on manufacturing, {{in recent years}} Camden has shifted its focus to eds and meds (education and medicine) {{in an attempt to}} revitalize itself. Of the top employers in Camden, many are education and/or healthcare providers: Cooper University Hospital, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Camden County College, Virtua, Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center, and CAMcare are all top employers. The eds and meds industry itself is the single largest source of jobs in the city: of the roughly 25,000 jobs in the city, 7,500 (30%) of them come from eds and meds institutions. The second largest source of jobs in Camden is the retail trade industry, which provides roughly 3,000 (12%) jobs. While already the largest employer in the city, the eds and meds industry in Camden is growing and <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> despite falling population and total employment: From 2000 to 2014, population and total employment in Camden fell by 3% and 10% respectively, but eds and meds employment grew by 67%.|$|E

Lekin boxing ka toh kuch promotion hi nahin hota India mein. (But boxing is still not promoted in India!) We don’t have boxing academies, we don’t even have proper boxing rings. I have lost count of the times I have approached the government and the sporting authorities for support, but nothing has happened. [...] In this country, everyone is hung up on cricket. Forget about boxing, India <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> well in other sports too.

500|$|When {{she and the}} {{children}} finally get home, Marge is horrified to hear that Homer intends to never go to church again. She tries to persuade him otherwise, but to no avail. That night, Marge prays for her husband at their bedside. Homer tries to seduce her while she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> but then falls asleep suddenly and has a dream in which God personally appears to him. God is furious with Homer for forsaking his church. Homer answers that [...] "I'm not a bad guy, I work hard, and I love my kids... so why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?" [...] God agrees to let Homer worship in his own way. Homer starts following his own religion tailored to his personal tastes, including holidays he invents {{to get out of}} work.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Beebe {{authored}} over 800 articles and 21 books, including his four-volume pheasant monograph. He had a total of 64 animals named after him, and himself described one new species of bird and 87 species of fish.

500|$|Pursued by {{the priests}} {{in a car}} chase that leads them through a {{shopping}} mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> the priests fly down in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling {{him that if he}} does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase {{on the face of the}} mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film [...] "is in President Rushmore's mouth" [...] and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.|$|E
500|$|During Valentine's Day, Homer, Chief Wiggum, Dr. Hibbert, Moe, and Ned Flanders {{investigate}} what Apu <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> {{they can}} stop it. They go around town and Flanders is {{thrown out of}} the group for suggesting they should be using their time to be more romantic to their wives instead of trying to sabotage Apu. Following Apu to the airport, the remaining group see Elton John there, and they think that he came to Springfield to perform a concert for Apu and Manjula at his insistence (in reality, he had to make an emergency landing because the chandelier on his plane was malfunctioning). However, Apu's actual plan is that he arranged for a skywriter to write [...] "I ♥ U MANJULA". During the trouble that ensues, Homer jumps on the plane during takeoff to try to stop the skywriter from spraying the message. When Homer destroys the plane's canister in mid-air it only sprayed part of the message - [...] "I ♥ U ★", which the other women think is for them. While Homer and the pilot fight, Marge remains unconvinced until the plane flies by and Homer drops out of it covered with roses after the plane flew out of control through a thorny rose patch, possibly giving Homer a collapsed lung. Nonetheless, Elton John is able to perform a private concert for Apu and Manjula, and their marriage is saved.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The reuse of significant, {{identical}}, {{or nearly}} identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> or citing the original work is sometimes described as [...] "self-plagiarism"; the term [...] "recycling fraud" [...] has been used.
