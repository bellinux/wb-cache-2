One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract.

Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate.

40|$|Abstract. Recently it {{has often}} been claimed that {{globalization}} eases the job of central banks as it helps to tame inflation. This is used to argue that central banks (particularly the ECB, referring to the objectives as laid down in the EU Treaty) could or should reduce their efforts in the fight against inflation in favor of supporting the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> of the governments. This paper takes a critical look at this argument, pointing to the structural changes associated with globalization and to the corresponding increase in uncertainty by which the central banks are affected. As an example of this, the increase in financial volatility is analyzed and explained as the result of optimal portfolio allocation, and its implications for monetary policy are discussed...|$|R
