25|$|The largest bridge dam was the Band-e Kaisar {{which was}} erected by a Roman {{workforce}} on Sassanid {{territory in the}} 3rdcenturyAD. The approximately 500m long structure, a novel combination of overflow dam and arcaded bridge, crossed Iran's most effluent river on more than forty arches. The most eastern Roman civil <b>engineering</b> <b>structure</b> ever built, its dual-purpose design exerted a profound influence on Iranian dam building.|$|E
500|$|The Bridge near Limyra (in , [...] "Bridge of the Forty Arches") is a late Roman {{bridge in}} Lycia, in modern {{south-west}} Turkey, {{and one of}} the oldest segmented arch bridges in the world. Located near the ancient city of Limyra, it is the largest civil <b>engineering</b> <b>structure</b> of antiquity in the region, spanning the Alakır Çayı river over a length of [...] on 26 segmental arches. These arches, with a span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, give the bridge an unusually flat profile, and were unsurpassed as an architectural achievement until the late Middle Ages. Today, the structure is largely buried by river sediments and surrounded by greenhouses. Despite its unique features, the bridge remains relatively unknown, and only in the 1970s did researchers from the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute carry out field examinations on the site.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{describes}} hydraulic <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> which are built in low-head water power hydro systems and {{which can also}} be used to stabilize river bank slopes. The paper gives information on the condition of riverbanks in Samara region and underlines the necessity to increase the amount of works on bank-stabilization. The paper stresses the importance of decreasing the expenses on building bank-stabilizing hydraulic <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> without any loss in their reliability and safety. Authors propose to build such structures using composite materials and their modifications and take geosynthetics, polymer-impregnated concrete and waste-/by-products as their constituents.
