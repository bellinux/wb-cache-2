5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E

At {{the north end of the}} plaza <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Legion Mall, which is the site of the administration buildings of the Legion, as well as a memorial cenotaph.

The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E

5|$|The freeway bears several {{names in}} {{addition}} to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the Detroitâ€“Toledo Expressway during planning in the 1950s and 1960s.

Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway, named for politicians who helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Legion Memorial Highway, after the organization of the same name. Various sections carry components of the four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
