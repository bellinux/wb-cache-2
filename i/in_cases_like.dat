5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. <b>In</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E
25|$|Because the ESR {{decreases}} {{with increasing}} frequencies. the ripple current data sheet value, specified at 100/120Hz, can be higher at higher frequencies. <b>In</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> this manufacturers specify correction factors for ripple current values at higher frequencies. For example, the ripple current at 10kHz {{can usually be}} approximated to be 30 to 40% higher than the 100/120 value.|$|E

25|$|When Helvering v. Davis {{was argued}} before the Court, {{the larger issue}} of {{constitutionality}} of the old-age insurance portion of Social Security was not decided. The case was limited to whether the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress's taxing power. Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system's constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress's spending power may be more coextensive, as shown <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> South Dakota v. Dole during the Reagan Administration.|$|E
25|$|At nine on Thursday morning, April 9, 1931, {{the five}} {{defendants}} in Wednesday's trial were all found guilty. Roy Wright's jury {{could not agree}} on sentencing, and was declared a hung jury that afternoon. All the jurors agreed on his guilt, but seven insisted on the death sentence while five held out for life imprisonment (<b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> this, that was often {{an indication that the}} jurors believed the suspect was innocent but they were unwilling to go against community norms of conviction). Judge Hawkins declared a mistrial.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> some <b>cases,</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the French {{examples}} below, crasis {{involves the}} grammaticalization of two individual lexical items into one, but <b>in</b> other <b>cases,</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the Greek examples, crasis is the orthographic {{representation of the}} encliticization and vowel reduction of one grammatical form with another. The {{difference between the two}} is that the Greek examples involve two grammatical words and a single phonological word and the French examples involve a single phonological word and grammatical word.|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{do not see}} {{the case}} as setting a precedent because the unique circumstances surrounding the Trail smelter have been articulated and discussed multiple times, therefore the arguments that arise for transboundary international law are divorced from the context they are derived from; this distorts the decisions made <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> the Trail Arbitration. For the arbitration, the decisions that appear to be the focus of literature on transboundary international law precedents are sub-articles 2 and 4 from Article 3 of the International Joint Commission's (IJC) recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time offenders are banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} damage {{to just one}} side of the MTL, there is {{opportunity}} for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex to remap when necessary. Remapping can occur <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> the one above, and, with time, the patient can recover and become more skilled at remembering. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies– in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor– demonstrates this. This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were afflicted. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has not been investigated much, but imaging results show that it is likely.|$|E

25|$|Some {{independent}} {{cities are}} still grouped with their former provinces {{for the purposes}} of representation in the Congress of the Philippines. While 24 independent cities have their own representative(s) in Congress, some still remain part of the congressional representation of the province to which they previously belonged: Butuan, for example, still forms part of the 1st Congressional District of Agusan del Norte. <b>In</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> this, independent cities that do not vote for provincial officials are excluded from Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial council) districts, and the allotment of SP members is adjusted accordingly by COMELEC with proper consideration of population. For example, Agusan del Norte (being a third income-class province) is entitled to elect eight members to its Sangguniang Panlalawigan, and belongs to two congressional districts. The seats of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are not evenly distributed (4-4) between the province's first and second congressional districts because its 1st Congressional district contains Butuan, an independent city which does not vote for provincial officials. Rather, the seats are distributed 1-7 to account for the small population of the province's 1st Sangguniang Panlalawigan district (consisting only of Las Nieves) and the bulk of the province's population being in the second district. On the other hand, the city of Lucena, which is eligible to vote for provincial officials, still forms part of the province of Quezon's 2nd Sangguniang Panlalawigan district, which is coterminous with the 2nd congressional district of Quezon.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{observed}} that Justice Kennedy's majority opinion [...] "embraced Bustamonte's premise that when police request consent to search, the request itself carries the implication that an alternative of refusal exists". Other scholars, such as Ric Simmons, have noted that Drayton reflects [...] "the Court at the midpoint of this evolution, moving from a subjective binary test that focuses {{on whether or not}} the subject acted voluntarily, to a more nuanced objective test that focuses on the amount of compulsion used by the law enforcement officer". Additionally, Matthew Phillips wrote that Drayton [...] "illustrates the metamorphosis of the totality-of-the-circumstances test into a purely objective test" [...] because Justice Kennedy's opinion [...] "did not explicitly consider any subjective factors" [...] with respect to whether Drayton and Brown felt they could deny consent when questioned by the police. Phillips suggested that the decision to abandon subjective factors could lead to [...] "bizarre results" [...] <b>in</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>like</b> this, where [...] "circumstances of the search indicate at least some level of coercion".|$|E
500|$|Davis {{also noted}} the unusual {{situation}} in that [...] "a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders." [...] Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about [...] "girl gangs" [...] {{and the rise}} in violent crime committed by young women, and [...] "the probation service and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture {{on the streets of}} Britain." [...] Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London Probation Service Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: [...] "One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it." [...] However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show [...] "an {{increase in the number of}} women jailed for offences involving violence." [...] The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is [...] "characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration." [...] In one of the [...] "starkest signs of change" [...] there was evidence that [...] "in the 15—17 age group, girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up." [...] Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>like</b> this which involved female and male sadists, [...] "the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffle coat was an excuse to torture someone to death." ...|$|E
