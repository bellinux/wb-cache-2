5000|$|Wisconsinites {{experimented with}} over-snow {{vehicles}} before 1900, experimenting with bicycles equipped with runners and gripping fins; steam-propelled sleighs; and (later) Model T Fords converted with rear tractor treads and skis in front. A patent (554.482) for the Sled-Propeller design, without a model, was submitted on Sept. 5, 1895 by inventors William J. Culman and William B. Follis of Brule, Wisconsin. In the first races held near Three Lakes in 1926, 104 of these [...] "snowbuggies" [...] started.

60|$|That was Madeline's last clear {{sensation}} {{upon the}} ride. Blinded, dazed, she {{succumbed to the}} demands upon her strength. She reeled, fell back, only vaguely aware of a helping hand. Confusion seized her senses. All about her was a dark chaos through which she was rushing, rushing, rushing under the wrathful red eye of a setting sun. Then, as {{there was no more}} sound or sight for her, she felt there was no color. But the rush never slackened--a rush through opaque, limitless space. For moments, hours, ages she was propelled with the velocity of a shooting-star. The earth seemed a huge automobile. And it sped with her down an <b>endless</b> white <b>track</b> through the universe. Looming, ghostly, ghastly, spectral forms of cacti plants, large as pine-trees, stabbed her with giant spikes. She became an unstable being in a shapeless, colorless, soundless cosmos of unrelated things, but always rushing, even to meet the darkness that haunted her and never reached her.|$|R

Tom rests on the guttering, and it immediately falls off the house, sending Tom crashing harmlessly down to the ground, which startles the two dogs. In a cloud of black smoke, Tom, fearing for his life and fearing the worst, digs his own grave. As soon as the dust settles, Spike has barely begun to excavate the cat when he suddenly realizes that both bulldogs have been cured of their hiccups thanks to Tom. Spike is overjoyed, congratulates Tom and says that from now on, anything he does is okay with him and Tyke and that involves chasing Jerry. As soon as Jerry hears this, he goes to his mousehole, puts on his hat and briefcase and puts a sign on his door. Tom runs to the door and reads the sign which says, [...] "Gone South For Sake Of Health."

40|$|Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} that glides over surfaces {{without the}} aid of flagella. Two motility systems are used for locomotion: social-motility, powered by the retraction of type IV pili, and adventurous (A) -motility, powered by unknown mechanism(s). We have shown that AgmU, an A-motility protein, is part of a multiprotein complex that spans the inner membrane and periplasm of M. xanthus. In this paper, we present evidence that periplasmic AgmU decorates a looped continuous helix that rotates clockwise as cells glide forward, reversing its rotation when cells reverse polarity. Inhibitor studies showed that the AgmU helix rotation is driven by proton motive force (PMF) and depends on actin-like MreB cytoskeletal filaments. The AgmU motility complex was found to interact with MotAB homologs. Our data are consistent with a mechanochemical model in which PMF-driven motors, similar to bacterial flagella stator complexes, run along an <b>endless</b> looped helical <b>track,</b> driving rotation of the track; deformation of the cell surface by the AgmU-associated proteins creates pressure waves in the slime, pushing cells forward...|$|R

50|$|The {{track system}} {{is built into}} the truss to guide the step chain, which {{continuously}} pulls the steps from the bottom platform and back to the top in an <b>endless</b> loop. One <b>track</b> guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the comb plate. Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At {{the top and bottom of}} the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the bottom landing, where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the bottom landing. At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.|$|R
40|$|Victorian England was {{the first}} empire in history to imagine itself as liberal, believing that its own power could bring law to the darkest and most unruly corners of the world. But despite {{covering}} nearly the entire period known as the Pax Britannica, Victoria's long reign {{did not include a}} single year without war. 	The conceptual knots presented by England's global power forced some of the century's most canonical authors to confront, and attempt to solve, contradictions fundamental to their self-consciously liberal society. Because law was understood by many Victorian theorists as the opposite of violence, it was when metropolitan thinkers came up against the fringes of civilization's ordering power, in the empire, that the violence underwriting peace become most uncomfortably plain. "Out there," said jurist James Fitzjames Stephen, "you see real government. " But if what Stephen called the liberal state's quiet but crushing force emerged most explicitly at the peripheries of law's reach, literary forms composed {{at the center of the}} imperial network [...] London [...] reveal the problem of liberal violence as absence, as silence: as a problem. These problems became dilemmas of narrative and poetic form that I argue are legible across linked areas of Victorian literary production: from the realist masterpiece (The Mill on the Floss) and the philosophical treatise (A System of Logic) to works of political historicism (On Liberty), sensation fiction (Armadale), and apparently apolitical poetry about flowers (Poems and Ballads). Forms of Empire looks to show how the Victorian state's interrelated forms [...] literary and political, conceptual and historical [...] expose the violence liberal theory could not see. 	Forms of Empire builds on and seeks to advance work on the pairing of "liberalism and empire" in the broad area of cultural studies. To do so it works dialectically, placing Victorian liberalism's vision of perpetual peace in the context of the empire's <b>endless</b> war and <b>tracking</b> loose networks of London-based thinkers as they confronted the problem of how violence relates to law. This process exposes live debates, both explicit and implicit, about just what force secured Victorian England's so-called Age of Equipoise. What emerges is a particularly literary analysis of how linked coteries of Victorian writers, through the height and decline of a great world power, attempted to make sense of the uneasy links they saw (and did not see) between liberalism and empire, the forms of law and the disorder of violence [...] the vexed connection, that is, between peace and war. 	The project's focus on literary structure and political theory is also historical, tracing Victorian global rule from its phase of hegemonic globalization at mid-century (the so-called Age of Equipoise) into its more openly war-torn, post- 1870 decline, a structure that corresponds to the project's two halves. While reframing existing periodizations of empire in Victorian Studies, this genealogical procedure also particularizes what is often studied as a homogenous "imperial discourse. " Forms of Empire is necessarily interdisciplinary, since it charts the conceptual cross-pollination among semi-autonomous fields of Victorian knowledge: political theory, anthropology, economics, philosophy, and literature, among others. But it is also focused on method, showing that theoretical debates among Victorians themselves [...] about the dilemmas of their hegemony [...] can illuminate controversies about liberalism, violence, and method in a newer moment of empire, ours.
