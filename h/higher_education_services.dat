40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{international}} <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> in i) Australia {{as one of the}} leaders in this service and ii) Thailand as an eastern developing country that has potential to offer this service. However, as a new country offering this service, Thailand lacks experience of operating it in the world market. Therefore, it is necessary to learn from a leading country, which has more experience, like Australia. This study aims to i) identify the factors affecting international students in coming to study at HEIs (<b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> Institutions) in Thailand and in Australia (Melbourne), ii) explore how these factors influence each stage in the model of "International Students' Innovation Decision Process" in offering the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> of Thailand and Australia (Melbourne), iii) present the implications of {{the results of this study}} with regard to marketing of the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> by Thailand, iv) reveal how international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> is perceived by persons who are involved with this area in Thailand/Australia (Melbourne) and v) Propose practical directions for the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> of Thailand by adapting the useful experiences of Australia (Melbourne). When international students have studied in their home countries, the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> offered by other countries is a 'new' service to them. This view is therefore different to that taken by previous studies in similar areas. Therefore, the model in this study of 'the International Students' Innovation Decision Process' was developed in order to examine the factors affecting international students when making a decision to study abroad in Thailand and Australia. It was also developed to explore their experiences when they were studying at <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> Institutions: HEIs in both countries. The results of the study including the findings of Australia's experiences in offering the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> will be used to assist Thailand in offering a high quality international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service.</b> v In this study both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The qualitative component included in-depth interviews with persons involved in the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> in Thailand and Australia. The quantitative component involved a questionnaire survey which was designed to investigate factors affecting international students when making a decision to enrol, and when studying at HEIs in Thailand and Australia. The survey of international students in both countries was used to investigate 'the International Students' Innovation Decision Process. It incorporated five groups of factors; sources of information, HEI characteristics, country characteristics, benefits and risks of study abroad. Seventeen (17) HEIs and one (1) government department in Thailand and four (4) HEIs in Australia (Melbourne) were used for this study. Results of the in-depth interviews indicated that the demand by international students for study abroad in Thailand and Australia is still high. It was found in both countries that the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> offers major benefits including cultural exchange as well as financial benefits. Strategies for offering this service that have been successful in Australia, for example use of reliable private agents, were identified and this could be utilised by HEIs in Thailand when offering the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> to prospective international students. Findings of the survey with international students in both countries of this study identified 4 stages in 'the International Students' Innovation Decision Process' Knowledge Stage: building up the knowledge base Persuasion and Decision Stage: assessment and decision activities - Implementation Stage: reassessment activities - Confirmation/Disconfirmation Stage: confirmation/disconfirmation decision The international students' knowledge about study abroad in Thailand and Australia was found to be likely increased by word of mouth communication from acquaintances and also from the internet. Sponsors, parents and friends were likely to be influential vi sources of information when international students were making a decision to enrol at HEIs in both countries. HEI characteristics such as standard of courses and recognition of qualification, country characteristics, for example reasonable cost of living, were factors that influenced international students when making a decision to enrol at HEIs in both countries. High benefits and perceived risks of study abroad influenced international students when making a decision to enrol at HEIs in both countries. The results indicated that expectations of international students in both countries expectations were not met for all HEI and country characteristics once they were studying at HEIs in the destination country. For international students in Thailand, perceptions of the benefits of study abroad did not change, whereas in Australia perceptions of the benefits of study abroad such as 'learn English with native speakers' decreased. However, international students' perceptions of risks of study abroad changed very little in both countries. Further, the majority of international students in both countries intended to complete their study (at the confirmation/disconfirmation stage) in the destination country. This was the final stage of 'the International Students' Innovation Decision Process'. The international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> in this study is defined as a 'new' service (an innovation) for international students, who have already made a decision to enrol at HEIs in other countries. In order to examine the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> as a 'new' service for international students who look for a place to study abroad, Rogers' (1995) innovation decision process was an effective model to utilise and adapt to examine international student perceptions and their experiences of the international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> in Thailand/Australia in each stage of 'the International Students' Innovation Decision Process' model. Moreover this model is also expected that this model will be helpful for future researchers who are interested in conducting research in similar areas particularly for research in developing countries that wish to offer international <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Public Relations Management) Learning through {{experience}} or experiential learning is {{an aspect of}} learning {{that proved to be}} very challenging to study. This study aimed to investigate the contemporary view of experiential learning and the practices used by <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> providers In South Africa in the implementation of experiential learning activities in public relations qualifications. <b>Higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> providers {{play a significant role in}} determining the content of a curriculum and for that reason it was decided to start this investigation by focusing on <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> providers. The study aimed to explore and analyse the concept of experiential learning as it pertains to public relations education and training and develop a framework for effective and standardised implementation. Experiential learning can be defined as a holistic approach to learning in which the learner is actively involved in the learning process by means of concrete experience, abstract conceptualisation, observation and reflection as well as active experimentation. <b>Higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> providers have included experiential learning activities in their education and training programmes for a number of years. International and local public relations qualifications have as part of the proposed curriculum, internships or cooperative education programmes included as a credit bearing component to the qualification. The research study began by determining what experiential learning is, how <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>service</b> providers view experiential learning, its relevance to public relations education and training and how it is implemented in public relations qualifications across South Africa. Educators, learners and future employers all form part of the stakeholder group involved in the education and training of public relations practitioners for the South African industry. The expectations of these groups of individuals need to be taken into consideration when designing qualifications, and partnerships are needed to ensure that all are involved in achieving the set objectives.

40|$|Historically, {{institutions}} of <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> have been {{perceived to be}} isolated from the real concerns of the world. They have appeared to be ivory towers and bastions of knowledge to which mere mortals can only aspire. There is currently still a call in the South Africa for education that is relevant and applicable {{to the development of}} South Africa. Through emphasizing community engagement and implementing service learning various dynamic approaches are now being considered to link “traditional domains of foundational knowledge and professional knowledge with a new emphasis on socially responsive knowledge” (Altman in Kenny & Gallagher, 2000 : 1). Altman suggests that service learning links the knowledge, skills and experiences of learners in a way that enables them to act and respond to social problems and engage with communities. The aim of the research was to through an appreciative inquiry framework determine what is being done in respect to and how best to support and encourage the continued implementation of community engagement and service learning in South Africa. The research focuses on how service learning and community engagement can be made sustainable in South Africa. It identifies what service learning practices are being established by <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions in South Africa following the period typified as the era of the Community <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Service</b> Partnership programme. Over a period of nine years, <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions received external support from the Community <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Service</b> Partnership programme. In 2008, the Community <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Service</b> Partnership programme was transferred to the <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> Quality Committee and the support and funding, previously supplied by the Community <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Service</b> Partnership programme, was terminated.

These developments in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> serve as a backdrop for the need for transformation and change in South Africa. In response to the fundamental changes occurring in South Africa, there is an imminent need to transform the function, role and purpose of <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions.
