40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a time-domain Discontinuous Galerkin dissipation-free method for the {{transient}} solution of the three-dimensional linearized Euler equations around a steady-state solution. In the general context of a non-uniform supporting flow, we prove, using the well-known symmetrization of Euler equations, that some aeroacoustic energy satisfies a balance equation with source term at the continuous level, and that our numerical framework satisfies an equivalent balance equation at the discrete level and is genuinely dissipation-free. Moreover, there exists a correction term in aeroacoustic variables such that the aeroacoustic energy is exactly preserved, and therefore {{the stability of the}} scheme can be proved. This leads to a new filtering of <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities.</b> In the case of P 1 Lagrange basis functions and tetrahedral unstructured meshes, a parallel implementation of the method has been developed, based on message passing and mesh partitioning. Three-dimensional numerical results confirm the theoretical properties of the method. They include test-cases where <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities</b> appear and can be eliminated by addition of the source term...|$|R
40|$|We adapt {{a modern}} scheme of {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to our tree N-body/SPH galactic chemodynamics code GCD+. The applied scheme includes imple- mentations of the artificial viscosity switch and artificial thermal conductivity pro- posed by Morris & Monaghan (1997), Rosswog & Price (2007) and Price (2008), to model discontinuities and <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities</b> more accurately. We first present hydrodynamics test simulations and contrast {{the results to}} runs undertaken without artificial viscosity switch or thermal conduction. In addition, we also explore the different levels of smoothing by adopting larger or smaller smoothing lengths, i. e. a larger or smaller number of neighbour particles, Nnb. We demonstrate that the new version of GCD+ is capable of modelling <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities</b> to a simi- lar level as the mesh code, Athena. From the Gresho vortex, point-like explosion and self-similar collapse tests, we conclude that setting the smoothing length to keep the number of neighbour particles as high as Nnb~ 58 is preferable to adopting smaller smoothing lengths.

50|$|The <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instability</b> (KHI) is an {{application}} of hydrodynamic stability {{that can be seen}} in nature. It occurs when there are two fluids flowing at different velocities. The difference in velocity of the fluids causes a shear velocity at the interface of the two layers. The shear velocity of one fluid moving induces a shear stress on the other which, if greater than the restraining surface tension, then results in an instability along the interface between them. This motion causes the appearance of a series of overturning ocean waves, a characteristic of the <b>Kelvin-Helmholtz</b> <b>instability.</b> Indeed, the apparent ocean wave-like nature is an example of vortex formation, which are formed when a fluid is rotating about some axis, and is often associated with this phenomenon.|$|E
