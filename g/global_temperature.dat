Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average <b>global</b> <b>temperature</b> have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Gupta et al., (2015), {{analyzed}} whether sunspot numbers cause <b>global</b> <b>temperatures</b> based on monthly data covering the period 1880 : 1 - 2013 : 9. The authors find that standard time domain Granger causality test fails {{to reject the}} null hypothesis that sunspot numbers does not cause <b>global</b> <b>temperatures</b> for both full and sub-samples, namely 1880 : 1 - 1936 : 2, 1936 : 3 - 1986 : 11 and 1986 : 12 - 2013 : 9 (identified based on tests of structural breaks). However, frequency domain causality test detects predictability for the full-sample at short (2 to 2. 6 months) cycle lengths, but not the sub-samples. But since, full-sample causality cannot be relied upon due to structural breaks, Gupta et al., (2015) concludes that the evidence of causality running from sunspot numbers to <b>global</b> <b>temperatures</b> is weak and inconclusive. Given {{the importance of the}} issue of global warming, our current paper aims to revisit this issue of whether sunspot numbers cause <b>global</b> <b>temperatures,</b> using the same data set and sub-samples used by Gupta et al., (2015), based on an nonparametric Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) -based causality test. Based on this test, we however, show that sunspot numbers have predictive ability for <b>global</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the three sub-samples, over and above the full-sample. Thus, generally speaking, our non-parametric SSA-based causality test outperformed both time domain and frequency domain causality tests and highlighted that sunspot numbers have always been important in predicting <b>global</b> <b>temperatures.</b> [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid <b>global</b> <b>temperature</b> changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the <b>global</b> <b>temperature</b> and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include {{the positions of the}} continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E

5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in <b>global</b> <b>temperature</b> would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E

25|$|The core of {{the concept}} of runaway climate change is the idea of a large {{positive}} feedback within the climate system. When a change in <b>global</b> <b>temperature</b> causes an event to occur which itself changes <b>global</b> <b>temperature,</b> this is referred to as a feedback effect. If this effect acts {{in the same direction as}} the original temperature change, it is a destabilising positive feedback (e.g. warming causing more warming); and if in the opposite direction, it is a stabilising negative feedback (e.g. warming causing a cooling effect). If a sufficiently strong net positive feedback occurs, it is said that a climate tipping point has been passed and the temperature will continue to change until the changed conditions result in negative feedbacks that restabilise the climate.|$|E

40|$|We study time {{evolution}} {{of the relationship between}} sunspot numbers and <b>global</b> <b>temperatures</b> between 1880 and 2016 using wavelet coherence framework. The results suggest that the relationship is stable in time. Changes in the sunspot numbers precede changes in the temperatures by more than two years as suggested by the wavelet phase differences. This leading position of the sun activity is stable in time as well. However, the relationship has been disturbed by increasing $CO_ 2 $ emissions since 1960 s. Without controlling for the effect of possible global warming, or more precisely the positive connection between increasing $CO_ 2 $ emissions and the <b>global</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the findings would have been quite different.
