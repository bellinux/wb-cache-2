40|$|Abstract: Hurricane Katrina’s {{impact on}} the economy and {{infrastructure}} of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama represents an immediate concern to commercial enterprises, area residents, and policymakers at all levels. Understanding the severity <b>of</b> the <b>damages</b> and the magnitude of the recovery efforts are important for both private and public decision makers deploying resources in the affected area. This paper provides initial estimates <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> in a number of infrastructure categories and residential and commercial structures, content and equipment. The estimation is based upon earlier analysis (Burton and Hicks, 2003) which provided an economic model <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> based upon the upper Mississippi floods of 1993. Specifically we estimate that Hurricane Katrina has generated commercial structure <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 21 Billion, commercial equipment <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 36 Billion, residential structure and content <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> almost $ 75 Billion, electric utility <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 231 Million, highway <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 3 Billion, sewer system <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 1. 2 Billion and commercial revenue losses of $ 4. 6 Billion. We are unable to estimate water system, and some key infrastructure damages at this point, and have not included the economic consequences of the loss <b>of</b> life or <b>damage</b> to the regions environmental amenities...|$|R

Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus {{the full extent of the}} hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain.

5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121.

It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
