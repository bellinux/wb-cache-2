5|$|The album {{inspired}} a radio play, also titled OK Computer, which was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2007. The play, written by Joel Horwood, Chris Perkins, Al Smith and Chris Thorpe, interprets the album's 12 tracks <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{about a man}} who awakens in a Berlin hospital with memory loss and returns to England with doubts that the life he's returned to is his own.|$|E

Several former companions of the Doctor are referenced in the story Death of the Doctor, and the episode also includes brief on-screen flashbacks showing the Third, Fourth and Tenth Doctors.

In an issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Sophie Aldred was read an email from Russell T. Davies, in which he declared his plans to bring Ace <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> had the show continued.

25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because {{a sense of identity}} develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Research {{suggests that}} memories that have more influence and significance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's identity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). Identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive processes to ensure recall of these memories. The events from this period {{are more likely to be}} organized <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> or view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E
25|$|Tulsidas was {{inspired}} by Adhyatma Ramayana, where Rama and other characters of the Valmiki Ramayana along with their attributes (saguna narrative) were transposed into spiritual terms and abstract rendering of an Atma (soul, self, Brahman) without attributes (nirguna reality). According to Kapoor, Rama's life story in the Ramacharitamanasa combines mythology, philosophy and religious beliefs <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of life, a code of ethics, a treatise on universal human values. It debates in its dialogues the human dilemmas, the ideal standards of behavior, duties to those one loves, and mutual responsibilities. It inspires the audience to view their own lives from a spiritual plane, encouraging the virtuous to keep going, and comforting those oppressed with a healing balm.|$|E

Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E

Also in 2009, Toriyama drew a manga titled Delicious Island's Mr. U for Anjō's Rural Society Project, a nonprofit environmental organization that teaches the importance of agriculture and nature to young children.

[...] The manga is cited as being cute by critics, and in some cases too cute; however, Anderson stated that [...] "much like Magic Knight Rayearth, even a cute story will have its depth and drama."

500|$|Women and women's issues {{dominate}} Mary Shelley's drama—no male characters appear, {{with the}} brief exception of Ascalaphus. However, as Romanticist Marjean Purinton argues, {{there is a}} strong masculine presence in the play even without male characters, suggesting [...] "the ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in the domestic sphere". Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about female solidarity and community—these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate. Ceres's love—a mother's love—challenges the power of the gods. Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres's point of view; [...] "her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as ‘Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.’" [...] Shelley writes active, rather than passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres's anger, not her grief, that brings [...] "winter's blight". However, Proserpine's abduction is prefigured in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unquiet Dead" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the revival to be set in the past, and was {{intended}} to show the series' range. The original brief and script included a focus on mediums and was grimmer in tone, but it evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about zombies and became more of a [...] "romp". Callow, who had researched Dickens as well as portraying him on multiple occasions, accepted to guest star in [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] because he felt the historical figure was written accurately. The episode also features a guest appearance by actress Eve Myles; Myles {{would go on to}} play Gwen Cooper in the Doctor Who spin-off series Torchwood from 2006. As contemporary Cardiff, location of the Doctor Who production, did not have enough Victorian architecture, the episode was filmed in Swansea. Computer generated imagery (CGI) was used as the main visual effect for the Gelth. [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was seen by 8.86 million viewers in the United Kingdom on first broadcast. It attracted generally positive reception, although some reviewers criticised some plot points and lack of moral dilemma.|$|E
500|$|Okada's main {{wish for}} the title was it to [...] "go back to the Creation". The initial concept of a {{triggered}} rebirth to prevent stagnation was suggested by Kaneko upon seeing a change in fashion: {{after a period of}} flashy or gaudy clothing tastes, people had begun wearing plain suits. Using this, he thought up the concept of this signalling a stagnation in the world's life energy, necessitating a drastic change. The game's main setting of Shinjuku in Tokyo in ruins came from Okada, who visualized areas like Kabukichō and Shibuya as good settings. The Reasons were inspired by the team's want to show several styles for living. The Manikins were created as a representation of the Vortex World and the war between the Reasons, acting as a mass pressuring for the birth of a new world. They mirrored the mechanisms of a country with a high population, and were based on the idea of people being overwhelmed by numbers and acting in accordance with a common norm. The scenario was written by Shogo Isogai, whose main task was to take Okada and Kaneko's vision and turn it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that would fit into the framework of a traditional Megami Tensei game. The overall concept was so grand that it seemed at times too ambitious, and involved the layering of multiple interactions between different factions and ideals, alongside incorporating the common Megami Tensei narrative features such as multiple endings and the modern-day setting. The story had multiple possible routes and endings to emphasize the importance of the player's decisions. One of the early concepts that needed to be cut was giant demons battling each other in Tokyo.|$|E

Tolkien attempted to rework the story of Kullervo <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of his own, and though he never finished, similarities to the story can still be seen in the tale of Túrin Turambar. Both are tragic heroes who accidentally commit incest with their sister who on finding out kills herself by leaping into water.

2500|$|Themes and motifs from mythology appear {{frequently}} in Egyptian literature, even outside of religious writings. An early instruction text, the [...] "Teaching for King Merykara" [...] from the Middle Kingdom, contains a brief {{reference to a}} myth of some kind, possibly the Destruction of Mankind; the earliest known Egyptian short story, [...] "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor", incorporates ideas about the gods and the eventual dissolution of the world <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> set in the past. Some later stories take much of their plot from mythical events: [...] "Tale of the Two Brothers" [...] adapts parts of the Osiris myth into a fantastic story about ordinary people, and [...] "The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood" [...] transforms the conflict between Horus and Set into an allegory.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Eastin {{stated that}} he {{originally}} had the idea for White Collar while sitting in a hot tub before the WGA strike in 2008.

The idea evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> focusing on a man in prison who is let out to solve crimes. However, after being told that the show sounded similar to the NBC series Life, the idea was shelved.
