5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the <b>drilling</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Drilling also risks contaminating {{surface water}} and groundwater, which harms people {{drinking}} from those water sources. This contamination happens when hazardous chemicals from the <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> leak into the water, when processing and refining the gas leave residue, and when {{disposal of waste}} water nearby pollutes the land. These chemicals can be radioactive materials, methane, other gases, and carcinogenic chemicals. However, the industry has countered than this contamination {{is the result of}} bad practice and not of a bad industry.|$|E
40|$|Titanium and its alloys (Ti) are {{attractive}} for many applications {{due to their}} superior properties. However, they are regarded as hard-to-machine materials. Drilling is an important machining process since it is involved in nearly all Ti applications. It is desirable to develop cost-effective <b>drilling</b> <b>processes</b> for Ti and/or improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available processes. Such development and improvement will be benefited by a comprehensive literature review of <b>drilling</b> <b>processes</b> for Ti. This paper presents a literature review on mechanical <b>drilling</b> <b>processes</b> for Ti, namely, twist drilling, vibration assisted twist drilling, ultrasonic machining, and rotary ultrasonic machining. It discusses cutting force, cutting temperature, tool wear and tool life, hole quality (diameter and cylindricity, surface roughness, and burr), and chip type when drilling of Ti using these processes...|$|R

When the crystal attempts {{to interact with}} the Enterprise's computers, it is placed into a containment force field. The crystal begins to grow and gains access to the computer's translation program and attempts to communicate with the crew, treating the humans as an enemy, derisively calling them [...] "ugly bags of mostly water". [...] Picard discovers that Mandl and his team previously encountered the crystals; at the time, they had considered the possibility that the crystals were alive, but Mandl insisted on continuing to terraform. [...] The terraformers used a <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> responsible for removing the saline water layer from the water table of Velara III. This saline layer acted as a conductor, allowing many separate crystals to function as one life form. In a defensive response to the drilling, the crystal life form rewrote the laser's software and attacked the terraformers.|$|E

2500|$|The laser <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> {{involves}} the use of an infrared laser (of surgical grade at a wavelength about 1064nm) to bore very fine holes (less than 0.2 millimeters or 0.005inches in diameter) into a diamond to create a route of access to a black carbon crystal inclusion. Because diamond is transparent to the wavelength of the laser beam, a coating of amorphous carbon or other energy-absorbent substance is applied {{to the surface of the}} diamond to initiate the <b>drilling</b> <b>process.</b> The laser then burns a narrow tube or channel to the inclusion. Once the location of included black carbon crystal has been reached by the drill channel, the diamond is soaked in sulfuric acid to dissolve the black carbon crystal. After soaking in sulfuric acid the black carbon crystal will dissolve and become transparent (colorless) and sometimes slightly whitish opaque. Under microscopic inspection the fine drill or bore holes can be seen, but are not distracting and do not affect sparkle or brilliance of the diamond. While the channels are usually straight in direction, from an entry point on the surface, some drilling techniques are drilled from within, using naturally occurring fractures inside the stone to reach the inclusion in a way that mimics organic [...] "feathers" [...] (This method is sometimes referred to as KM drilling which stands for special drilling in Hebrew). The channels are microscopic so that dirt or debris cannot travel down the channel. The surface-reaching holes can only be seen by reflecting light off of the surface of the diamond during microscopic viewing such as a jeweler's 10x magnifying lens or loupe and are invisible to the naked eye.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, <b>process</b> {{monitoring}} of <b>drilling</b> <b>processes</b> using force and vibration signals has successfully been established. However, only few investigations were performed in the monitoring of chip breakage and chip transportation, while in gun drilling these properties are more relevant to ensure process robustness and performance than force and vibration. This paper presents a new monitoring approach of chip frequency and transportation for gun <b>drilling</b> <b>processes</b> using infrared light reflection next to the drilling bush. Gun drilling is a high performance cutting process used for small diameter and large aspect ratio drilling operations {{in the field of}} automotive, aeronautic, power generation and medical devices. The usage of new harder materials for future products increases the challenge of proper chip transportation and raises the need of chip monitoring being able to operate with economically acceptable parameters. The approach of optical chip detection highlights the opportunity of detecting chips smaller than 1 mm and velocities in axial direction of more than 16 m/s clearly and suggests new characteristic values to be used for process validation. For implementing the measurement principle a new sensor is designed. In addition, the opportunities of future data analysis and detection of characteristic values are explained...|$|R
