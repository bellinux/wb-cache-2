50|$|Semi-intensive farming {{corresponds}} <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> of ovine, bovine, caprine, porcine. It is {{the most}} dominant, due mainly {{to the lack of}} space and the predominance of the fattening of livestock farrow.|$|R

50|$|After the Corps of Discovery, {{the next}} major event in the area was the arrival of Texas cattle coming <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> up on the local grass after their long cattle drives. The cattle drives lasted from 1866 until the late 1880s.|$|R

40|$|An {{existence}} and uniqueness result, up <b>to</b> <b>fattening,</b> for crystalline mean curvature flows with forcing and arbitrary (convex) mobilities, is proven. This {{is achieved by}} introducing a new notion of solution to the corresponding level set formulation. Such a solution satisfies the comparison principle and a stability property {{with respect to the}} approximation by suitably regularized problems. The results are valid in any dimension and for arbitrary, possibly unbounded, initial closed sets. The approach accounts for the possible presence of a time-dependent bounded forcing term, with spatial Lipschitz continuity. As a by-product of the analysis, the problem of the convergence of the Almgren-Taylor-Wang minimizing movements scheme to a unique (up <b>to</b> <b>fattening)</b> "flat flow" in the case of general, possibly crystalline, anisotropies is settled...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} (i) {{describing}} Campylobacter excretion by conventional pigs in field conditions from sows <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs, and (ii) assessing {{the role of}} the environment as a source of pig contamination.

50|$|Kunekune {{are very}} easy to manage as {{they have the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> on little more than grass. They are the only true grazing pig and can be {{maintained}} with grass alone without supplementary feeding. An acre of grass can sustain as many as 5 kunekunes.|$|R
50|$|The {{farm was}} used for {{military}} parades during the First World War and as the site for victory celebrations in 1919. Before the Second World War, the Frusher family used the farm <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> pigs {{in the winter and}} as a popular recreation site in the summer.|$|R
40|$|Reports {{from several}} {{experiment}} stations have aroused {{much interest in}} the value of “steam processing” or “flaking” grain for beef cattle. During the process, some gelatinization or cooking of the grain occurs. This trial studied the addition of various amounts of completely gelatinized sorghum grain <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> steers rations...|$|R
50|$|Miles City {{was always}} a {{stopping}} point on the cattle drives from Texas, a place <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the herd before market. In 1881 the Northern Pacific Railroad extended its line through the city, and in 1844 the Montana Stockgrowers Association was formed there making it a leading cattle market.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{the station}} was owned by the New South Wales based Harris family. A trial for wet season {{cropping}} {{on a large scale}} was conducted in 2010 with 480 ha of sorghum being planted. The crop in turn will be used <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the cattle prior to export.|$|R
50|$|Tree {{species such}} as oak, hickory, and beech produce a hard mast—acorns, hickory nuts, and beechnuts. It has been {{traditional}} to turn pigs loose into forests <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> on this form of mast. Also branch tips of the latest year's growth are eaten by some wildlife, such as deer.|$|R
40|$|Mud crab {{fattening}} is {{a relatively}} new occupation in the Philippines. Efforts are being made to standardize techniques by private, small-scale, individual farmers.

40|$|Animal fats {{often are}} added {{in small amounts}} (1 - 2 %) to mixed {{commercial}} feeds primarily to reduce dustiness and to lubricate machinery.

50|$|Livestock {{speculation}} brought {{thousands of}} cattle {{to the open}} ranges in the late 1880s, the railroad was extended through the area, and Texas drove numerous cattle to Miles City <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> them on free grass and move them to {{where they could be}} loaded on trains bound for the slaughterhouses in Chicago.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} settlers in Fawkner was Michael Dowling and his family, who settled on their property at Major Road near Merri Creek in September 1902, grazing cattle <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> for market.

50|$|The Arrabury Pastoral Company, {{controlled}} by the Daley family, currently own the property along with neighbouring Cluny station that was acquired in 1992. Arrubury occupies and area of 7600 km2 and Cluny has an area of 5500 km2. Both properties are used <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> cattle that were bred in the gulf country.|$|R
50|$|The {{feeding area}} from the {{maternity}} roost is typically of radius 4 km, as neither the lactating females or young can travel far. In late August and September the bats feed on cranefly, <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> up before hibernation. Breeding females depend on beetles from April until June, and moths from June to August.|$|R
25|$|Indiana {{is located}} within the U.S. Corn Belt and Grain Belt. The state has a feedlot-style system raising corn <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> hogs and cattle. Along with corn, {{soybeans}} are also a major cash crop. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as Indianapolis and Chicago, assure that dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.|$|R
25|$|Neel {{proposed}} that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes was adaptive to the feast and famine cycles of paleolithic human existence, allowing humans <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> rapidly and profoundly {{during times of}} feast in order that they might better survive during times of famine. This would have been advantageous then {{but not in the}} current environment.|$|R
