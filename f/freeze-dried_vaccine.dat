40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{necessity}} for continuous refrigeration of liquid BCG vaccine during storage and transport in hot climates, various {{attempts have been made to}} develop more stable preparations. Several studies have indicated that <b>freeze-dried</b> BCG <b>vaccines,</b> and in particular the Japanese glutamate vaccine, are more resistant to high temperatures than liquid BCG vaccines. The present paper reports the results of three studies in schoolchildren designed to compare the heat-stability of three dried vaccines (Japanese glutamate vaccine, Japanese sucrose vaccine, and French glucose vaccine) and Danish liquid vaccine. The results showed that the allergenic potency of the Japanese glutamate vaccine was not much reduced even after storage at 42 °C for one month whereas the liquid vaccine was already seriously damaged after one month's storage at 30 °C. Exposure to a temperature of 50 °C for one month was found to reduce the allergenic capacity of all three <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>vaccines.</b> As exposure to such high temperatures hardly ever occurs under field conditions, it seems probable that the dried glutamate vaccine can be used without refrigeration even in tropical countries.

40|$|An {{influenza}} pandemic remains {{a major public}} health concern. A key strategy to prevent a pandemic is to stockpile and pre-position stable influenza vaccine to allow rapid deployment {{in response to an}} outbreak. However, most influenza vaccines today are formulated as liquids that are stable only within a temperature range of 2 °C to 8 °C and require use of a cold chain, making vaccine transportation, distribution, and storage complicated and expensive, particularly for developing countries. To support the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza preparedness in the United States and internationally, we developed two lead dry formulations of stable H 1 N 1 influenza subunit vaccines using freeze-drying technology. The stable formulations contain an excipient combination of a disaccharide, such as sucrose or trehalose, and glycine, in addition to a surfactant and phosphate buffer. The <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>vaccines</b> were shown to be safe and remained immunogenic in an in vivo study in mice. Moreover, the lead formulations demonstrated no significant loss of activity after 40 months at storage temperatures of 25 °C and 37 °C.

The vaccine contains killed E. coli bacteria over-expressing the main ETEC colonization factors (CFs) CFA/I, CS 3, CS and C 6, and a recombinant enterotoxin B subunit protein (LCTBA) given together with a recently developed enterotoxin-derived adjuvant, dmLT. A dry-powder vaccine formulation should be advantageous especially for use in low-income countries. Here we describe a method to produce a dry-powder formulation by freeze-drying of the vaccine using inulin as stabilizer. Although not completely preventing aggregation of bacteria during freeze-drying, the stabilizer provided both improved overall bacterial morphology and almost complete recovery of the CF and B subunit antigens. Most importantly, oral-intragastric immunization of mice with the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>vaccine</b> together with dmLT adjuvant elicited strong intestinal mucosal and serum antibody responses against all vaccine antigens, which were comparable to those achieved with the liquid vaccine.

40|$|Stockpiling of pre-pandemic {{influenza}} vaccines guarantees immediate vaccine availability to counteract an emerging pandemic. Generally, {{influenza vaccines}} {{need to be}} stored and handled refrigerated to prevent thermal degradation of the antigenic component. Requirement of a cold-chain, however, complicates stockpiling and the logistics of vaccine distribution. We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H 5 N 1 whole inactivated virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a <b>freeze-dried</b> powder, <b>vaccines</b> could be stored for 1  year at ambient temperature (20 °C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40 °C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3  months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40 °C for at least 3  months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3  months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40 °C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4 °C.

40|$|Bacterial {{concentrations}} in natural sea water were significantly reduced by 5 ptm filtration and subsequent treatment with ozone and UV light led to further reductions in total viable counts of bacteria and autoclaving water gave complete sterility. However, {{with the addition}} of artificial diets, such treated water was recolonised very rapidly and within 24 h, these water samples had significantly higher bacteria counts than the 5 pm filtered sea water treatment (f = 21. 30; p< 0. 001). Further treatment of 5 ýtrn filtered sea water also led to changes in the bacterial composition of the water. In ozonated and UV light irradiated water samples, the proportions of presumptive Vibrid sp. increased in the 24 h following treatment while in 5 ýLm filtered and natural sea water samples, the proportions of presumptive Vibrid sp. fell over the same period. When Penaeus indicus PZ 1 stage larvae were reared to PI- 1 stage in 5 lam filtered sea water, good larval survival was obtained irrespective of whether live or microencapsulated artificial diets were fed. In contrast, larvae raised in autoclaved, ozonated and UV light irradiated water exhibited significantly lower survival when raised on live diets and often showed complete mortalities when fed on microencapsulated diets. In periods of poor sea water quality, additions of bacteria from algal cultures to PZ 1 stage larvae fed algae had no effect on larval survival to M 1 stage for larvae reared in 5 gm filtered sea water or autoclaved water. In contrast, additions of these bacteria to larvae reared in 5 pm filtered sea water and fed on MED, led to a significant increase in larval survival. This effect was absent when larvae were reared in autoclaved water. Addition of bacteria from algal cultures were found to inhibit counts of presumed viable Vibrid sp. while having no effects on total viable counts. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of soluble protein leached from microencapsulated diets and micro particulate diets when incubated up to 48 h in bacterial laden and sterile water indicating that leaching is independent of microbial activity up to 48 h. However broken microcapsules gave higher total viable bacterial counts over 48 h in 5 ýtm filtered sea water when compared with intact microcapsules. Significant levels of protection were conferred on larvae when either fresh or <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>vaccines</b> were administered by Immersion, but not when such vaccines were administered orally. The degree of protection offered was correlated with the virulence of the pathogen from which the vaccine was made. Enhanced protection given by vaccines produced from the more virulent strains was not wholly due to activation of the prophenoloxidase system since such vaccines induced less stimulation of the prophenoloxidase system than less virulent strains. Untreated plasma of Penaeus vannamei significantly enhanced Escherichia coli growth compared with sea water nutrient medium. In contrast, plasma from vaccinated prawns exhibited antibacterial activity detectable up to 7 d after vaccination. Exposure to a mixture of fungicides Implicated in the initiation of the taura syndrome disease (TS), had no effects on the immune competence of P. indicus juveniles following live, in vivo pathogenic challenge. In addition, no effects on growth, growth rates, moulting rates or survival of postlarval and early juvenile prawns were observed following exposure to the fungicides. Prawns exhibited no gross or histopathological symptoms characteristic of TS...|$|R

Generally, {{influenza vaccines}} {{need to be}} stored and handled refrigerated to prevent thermal degradation of the antigenic component. Requirement of a cold-chain, however, complicates stockpiling and the logistics of vaccine distribution. We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H 5 N 1 whole inactivated virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a <b>freeze-dried</b> powder, <b>vaccines</b> could be stored for 1 year at ambient temperature (20 °C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40 °C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3 months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40 °C for at least 3 months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3 months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40 °C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4 °C. Use of the more stable dry-powder formulation could simplify stockpiling and thereby facilitating successful pandemic intervention.
