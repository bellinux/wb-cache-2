6000|$|... "We {{will take}} our seats on that side," [...] Chris said, [...] "and {{as we move}} in shout to them to <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{a great thing to}} get as many people we know in here as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect to}} have some trouble with them at first," [...] Mrs. Dodgson said cheerfully. [...] "I often tell my husband girls are ever so much more {{troublesome}} than boys, but I daresay I shall manage; and now, Mr Simpson, we {{are just going to}} have supper, <b>will</b> you <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> our first regular meal in the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, my friends, {{that the}} {{least we can}} do is to pass a formal vote of censure upon our comrade for such a grievous waste of his natural advantages. The only thing in his favour is, that he seems to have been giving up his whole {{attention}} to growing, and he has got so prodigiously broad and big that now he has again <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able {{to make up for the}} otherwise sinful loss of time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Amelius listened without conviction. [...] "It's {{certainly}} {{useless to}} make a secret of the matter now," [...] he said; [...] "but I don't see my way to making it more public still." [...] He paused, and looked at Mr. Hethcote. [...] "It so happens, sir," [...] he resumed, [...] "that this unfortunate affair {{is an example of}} some of the Rules of our Community, which I had not had time to speak of, when Mr. Dingwell here <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a relief to me to contradict these abominable falsehoods to somebody; and I should like (if you don't mind) to hear what you think of my conduct, from your own point of view. It might prepare me," [...] he added, smiling rather uneasily, [...] "for what I may find in the English newspapers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{search the}} whole {{of the back of the}} island with boats, keeping at oar's length from the cliffs. There must be some places where a man can climb up, {{probably}} gulleys worn by streams. Then to-morrow night sail round and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> again. I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> waiting for you about two miles off the land, and will show a light to seaward so that you will know where to find me. Then we can talk matters over, and you can get back to the other side again before morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{biggest problem}} in {{increasing}} awareness, I think, is that environmental protection still involves nothing but slogans. While many people see {{a conflict between}} economic development and environmental protection, I believe that when you come closer to nature {{to learn more about}} it, you will find no real conflict between the two. On the contrary, a deteriorating environment makes economic development a 'mission impossible.' It is just like when people sacrifice health to make money and then have to spend that money to recover their health. The Green Earth Volunteers is a big family of nature lovers. If you are interested in our goals, just <b>join</b> <b>us</b> and you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> surprised at how much you will enjoy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Senhor Armstrong," [...] {{replied the}} man, with {{a return of}} his stern expression, [...] "I have told you that my {{business}} is urgent. Not even the rescue of my old friend's daughter can turn me aside from it. When Manuela begged me to take her with me, I pointed out the difficulties and dangers of the route, and the necessity for my pursuing a long and devious course, {{but she said she}} feared to remain where she was; that, being young, strong, and accustomed to an active life, she felt sure she was equal to the journey; that she could trust me, and that she knew her father would approve of her taking the step. I agreed, with some hesitation. It turned out that the girl was right in her fears, for before we left the town it was attacked by the troops of Chili. The Peruvians made but a poor resistance, and it was carried by assault. When I saw that all hope of saving the place was gone, I managed to bring Manuela and her nurse away in safety. As I have told you, the nurse died, and now--here we are alone. Manuela chooses to run the risk. I will not turn aside from my duty. If you choose to <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> the girl <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safer--at least until we cross the mountains. On the other side I shall be joined by friends, if need be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} must be tea-time,' she said suddenly. 'Tea is a great meal with <b>us</b> here--you <b>will</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>will</b> you not?' And Ethelberta began to make for herself a passage through the boughs. Another rustle was heard a little way off, {{and one of the}} {{children}} appeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to turn the river here, if we can; and if you and your companions choose to <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> we <b>will</b> give you good wages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether," [...] Scott replied. [...] "Every share {{carries a}} vote. You {{and your brother}} hold a large block, and the friends I've persuaded to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> vote with me. Of course, if anybody bought up the most part of the other shares, he could give us trouble, but that's not likely. When it's obvious that we're making a good profit none of the holders <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to sell. In the meantime, {{some of the people}} are sending up a mining expert, and if they're {{satisfied}} with his opinion they'll give us the money." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 10a. [...] "Then one of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a Queen" [...] (Marco, Giuseppe, Gianetta, and Tessa) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't {{ask you to}} tell us {{anything}} more, Dick, till your mother <b>joins</b> <b>us,</b> or you <b>will</b> have {{to go over the}} story twice." ...|$|R

60|$|We shall criticize Heaven {{when we get}} there. I {{doubt if}} any of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pleased with the arrangements; we have grown so {{exceedingly}} critical.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The guards might <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> I <b>will</b> {{go down to}} {{the barracks}} and try them, if you choose' to-morrow. I am a boon-companion with a good many of them already. But after all, Prince Wulf--of course you are always right; we all know that--but what's the use of marrying this Hypatia to the Amal?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} sufficient," [...] the officer said, more cordially. [...] "I congratulate {{you on your}} escape. I confess it {{astonished}} us all, when a strange white officer, whom none of <b>us</b> knew, suddenly <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> You <b>will</b> find General Hunter somewhere over on the left. He is certain to have led the charge of the Soudanese." ...|$|R
6000|$|Profoundly {{disgusted with}} human kind,--as the noblest of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> at times,--Mr. Crewe flung down the paper, and {{actually}} forgot {{to send the}} fifty copies to his friends! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Dinner!” snorted Catherine, “what {{on earth}} is the good of dinner when none of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to appear at it? Look at your hair—and look at me! or rather, don’t.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} you will, Sammy my boy," [...] I said. [...] "But I hope, {{although}} things look queer, that none of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> called upon to die just yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as I thought," [...] {{the captain}} whispered. [...] "They {{have guessed that}} some of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ashore, and <b>will</b> make a rush upon us here, when the ships open fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adieu, my dear boy: we {{are both}} Wallingfords, and the nearest of kin to [...] each other, of the name. Clawbonny <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safe with either of us, and [...] either of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safe with Clawbonny.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> broad {{daylight}} {{by the time}} that we have finished our meal," [...] Jerry said, [...] "and I reckon none of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> wanting to sleep till we have got a sight of Harry's bonanza." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To save trouble,' Mr. Hardy went on, 'I {{suggest that}} we keep watch in the {{alphabetical}} order of our names. Twelve of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> on to-night, and the next twelve to-morrow night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Darling," [...] she said, [...] "you buy the Gallery, and I'll pay you {{four hundred}} {{a year for}} it. Then neither of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> any the worse off. Besides, it's a splendid investment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Alas!' said Hubert, 'this {{is worse}} than ever. As long as we were near the sea, I had hope, but now all trace of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lost, even if the Consul should send after us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe both of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{spared the}} pain of {{receiving}} promotion purchased {{by the death of}} a comrade and friend," [...] observed Mason kindly. [...] "It was reported that Sitgreaves said he would live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{very unfortunate}} occurrence," [...] {{answered}} George Strong. [...] "If there is a thief in Putnam Hall we ought to locate him. As long as he remains undetected none of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|CLARE. [Rising] I shan't {{be coming}} back. [Gazing at MRS. MILER'S hands, which are {{plaiting}} at her dress] I'm leaving Mr. Malise, and shan't see him again. And the suit against <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> withdrawn--the divorce suit--you understand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m {{played out}} and homesick! Wish I was back East, where I did my {{fishing in the}} natural way—on top of the water! But it’s a sure thing none of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> down at the wreck to-morrow.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] grumbled Roger. They had {{had only}} a quarter of an hour's rest for lunch. [...] "I reckon some of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> stiff in the morning," [...] and he was right, all felt {{somewhat}} sore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you might}} do that, Tim, but as we've no bacon here, that won't help us. No, we must {{put up with the}} cook, and I don't think any of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the worse for the dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just this: I joined your {{crowd to}} stand up for my rights not to commit murder. There's been {{mischief}} done already, an' the most of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sorry when we've had time to think the matter over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must not. You are {{the last}} person, you are indeed. He is so proud! Anything from <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> death to him. Yes! I know him, he will die sooner than be under an {{obligation}} to either of us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brag not, Dick," [...] said Hugh with a sad smile, [...] "for war is an {{uncertain}} game, {{and who knows}} which of <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> talking with his ancestors and praying the mercy of his Maker by this time to-morrow night?" ...|$|R
