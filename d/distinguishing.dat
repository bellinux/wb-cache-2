5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; <b>distinguishing</b> between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of <b>distinguishing</b> the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
