500|$|In August 2007, a Singaporean pub, Loof, sent an {{electronic}} direct mailer (e-flyer) {{to at least}} 1,500 members on its mailing list featuring a close-up shot of the crotch of a female model wearing a red swimsuit or pair of underpants bearing the crescent and five stars of the national flag. This was done {{as part of the}} pub's publicity campaign for its National Day events. According to Loof's marketing manager, [...] "he ad was definitely not meant as an insult to the country or anyone. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ad will be taken in the spirit of humour and fun." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
500|$|This {{led to the}} {{building}} of the first council housing estate in Gateshead. Alderman Hodkin laid the foundation stone on 27 October 1920; as work commenced the Alderman demonstrated the authority's concerns, telling the local newspaper that: [...] "we can build houses, but we cannot build homes. Only the people themselves can do that and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spirit of ‘esprit de corps’ will prevail and this will be a model estate" [...] Demand was highthere were 427 applicants for the first twenty eight houses builtand the council built further tracts of housing in a broad triangle between Sodhouse Bank, Ermine Crescent and The Avenue, although central government withdrew its promised funding. By 1936, most of the social housing available as of 2012 was in existence and provides accommodation to over half {{of the population of the}} suburb.|$|E

60|$|I {{had seen}} the thing so many times during my life within Pellucidar that I felt that I could {{anticipate}} to a nicety precisely what I was about to witness. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hunters would prove friendly {{and be able to}} direct me toward Sari.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are kind}} indeed to bear me so in remembrance," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "and I am indeed {{grateful}} for it. I have often wondered whether any fresh danger threatened you; but <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{advance of the}} Marquis of Hamilton's force {{would have given the}} Imperialists too much to do for them to disturb you." ...|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Himmler was {{inspired}} by the noted successes of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area south of Srem will be liberated by... the Bosnian division... so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state." ...|$|E

In a letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan said he was [...] "saddened by the hundreds of lives lost and disrupted due to the severe flooding in Chennai {{and other parts of}} Tamil Nadu. Like many Singaporeans, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> floods will recede soon. I am confident that normalcy will return to your state in the near future under your leadership," [...] he wrote. Balakrishnan added that he hoped Singapore's contributions would [...] "be of some assistance to those affected by the floods and demonstrate Singapore’s solidarity with the people of Tamil Nadu during this difficult period." [...] Stating it would donate a further S$209,670 (...) , the Singapore Red Cross also launched a public appeal for donations and placed a team of volunteers on standby to travel to India; SRC Secretary General and CEO Benjamin William said, [...] "We are closely monitoring the flood situation, and remain in close contact with our counterparts, the Indian Red Cross Society and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), to explore how we can further support the relief efforts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zoabi commented {{three years}} after the events, [...] "I came to the Knesset two days after the Marmara events, stunned by the way a {{political}} protest had become a bloodbath. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MKs would want to hear firsthand testimony. I was ready to be questioned. But I was so naive. I encountered hate politics." ...|$|R
60|$|The plants which I {{received}} {{during the}} early part of October from Kew never opened their leaves, though subjected to a high temperature. After examining the structure of some of them, I experimented on only two, as <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plants would grow; and I now regret that I did not sacrifice a greater number.|$|R

2500|$|Goldstone {{criticized the}} United Nations Human Rights Council {{resolution}} for targeting only Israel, {{and failing to}} include Hamas: [...] "This draft resolution saddens me as it includes only allegations against Israel. There {{is not a single}} phrase condemning Hamas as we have done in the report. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> council can modify the text." ...|$|E
60|$|The flat was by {{this time}} out of sight around <b>the</b> point. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sight of an empty flat {{drifting}} down shore might attract someone's attention and lead to investigation. That seemed to be my only hope. No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard's because of my non-appearance. They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam's.|$|R

2500|$|The Utzon Center in Aalborg, {{designed}} {{together with}} his son Kim, was the architect's last assignment.

It is intended to be a power centre for the architects and people of the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|... : [...] Foreign Secretary David Miliband {{issued a}} {{statement}} on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website saying [...] "The successful Presidential elections in Taiwan today are testament to Taiwan's vibrant democracy. The forthcoming change of administration is a real opportunity to renew efforts to improve cross-Strait relations. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Government and the new administration will now engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences and find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question, acceptable to the populations {{on both sides of}} the Straits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldstone {{and several}} U.S.-based rights groups denounced the resolution. Sarah Leah Whitson, a {{director}} of Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, commented that [...] "this sort of resolution sends a terrible message {{to the international community}} about American willingness to believe in international justice for all. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> members of Congress reject it. It's funny because it accuses the Goldstone Report of being one sided but it's not. It's this resolution that's one-sided and biased." [...] HRW also maintained that the House resolution [...] "has factual errors and would help shield from justice the perpetrators of serious abuses – both Israeli and Palestinian".|$|E

2500|$|Harry also {{released}} her fifth solo album in 2007. During this time, she delineated the different personae (Blondie the band, {{her role in}} the band, and Deborah Harry the singer) to an interviewer who asked why she played only solo music on the 2007 True Colors Tour: [...] "I've put together a new trio with no Blondie members in it. I really want to make a clear definition between Debbie's solo projects and Blondie, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audience can appreciate that and also appreciate this other material." [...] This was a longstanding issue with Harry, as the band name was often misconstrued as her own name. This led the band to feature a promotional slogan, [...] "Blondie is a group." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} made in 1880, Bishop Ignace Bourget called for Durocher's canonization, saying: [...] "I invoke her aid as a saint for myself, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lord will glorify her before men {{by having the}} church award her the honours of the altar." [...] On 9 November 1927, Alphonse-Emmanuel Deschamps, Auxiliary Bishop of Montreal, appointed an ecclesiastical tribunal to enquire into the possible canonisation of Durocher. [...] The tribunal was empowered by ecclesiastical mandate to collect anything written by Durocher, and called upon Roman Catholics of Montreal to produce any privately held documents in accordance with that mandate. [...] The evidence gathered by the tribunal was collected in a positio, which was then taken to Rome for presentation to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.|$|E
2500|$|Concluding his {{extensive}} reply dated 27 October 2009 to the Prime Minister, Dr Swire said: [...] "You have now received {{a much more}} comprehensive letter requesting a full inquiry from our group 'UK Families-Flight 103'. I {{am one of the}} signatories. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contents of this letter underline some of the reasons as to why I cannot possibly accept that any inquiry should be limited to Scotland, and I apologise if my previous personal letter of 24 August misled you over the main focus that the inquiry will need to address. That focus lies in London and {{at the door of the}} then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{allowed her}} to have her own way. Indeed, Aline {{generally}} insisted on this, while with many protestations of gratitude Minnie Fletcher departed the next morning, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> affair was ended. In this I was disappointed, for, returning with Jasper the next day from an outlying farm, I found Aline awaiting me {{in a state of}} suppressed excitement. She was paler than usual, and moved nervously, and the Marlin rifle lay on the table with the hammer drawn back.|$|R

2500|$|He had {{not been}} Governor General of Canada for five years before Willingdon {{received}} word {{that he was to}} be sent back to India as that country's viceroy and governor general. After being appointed to the British Privy Council on 20 March 1931, he was sworn in as such on 18 April 1931, merely two weeks after he was replaced in Canada by the Earl of Bessborough. When Willingdon arrived again in India, the country was gripped by the Great Depression and was soon leading Britain's departure from the gold standard, seeing thousands of tonnes of gold shipped to the United Kingdom through the port of Bombay. Of this, Willingdon said: [...] "For the first time in history, owing to the economic situation, Indians are disgorging gold. We have sent to London in the past two or three months, £25,000,000 sterling and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process will continue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ariel Sharon criticised the NATO {{bombing of}} Yugoslavia in 1999 {{as an act}} of [...] "brutal interventionism". Sharon said both Serbia and Kosovo have been victims of violence. He said prior to the current Yugoslav {{campaign}} against Kosovo Albanians, Serbians were the targets of attacks in the Kosovo province. [...] "Israel has a clear policy. We are against aggressive actions. We are against hurting innocent people. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible." [...] During the crisis, Elyakim Haetzni said the Serbs should be the first to receive Israeli aid. [...] "There are our traditional friends," [...] he told Israel Radio." [...] It was suggested that Sharon may have supported the Yugoslav position because of the Serbian population's history of saving Jews during the holocaust. On Sharon's death, Serbian minister Aleksandar Vulin stated: The Serbian people will remember Sharon for opposing the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia and advocating respect for sovereignty of other nations and a policy of not interfering with their internal affairs.|$|E
2500|$|... – High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said: [...] "I urge {{all sides}} to rapidly {{return to the}} {{democratic}} process, including the holding of free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections and the approval of a constitution, {{to be done in}} a fully inclusive manner, so as to permit the country to resume and complete its democratic transition. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new administration will be fully inclusive and reiterate the importance of ensuring full respect for fundamental rights, freedoms, {{and the rule of law}} and will hold the authorities to account for this. I strongly condemn all violent acts, offer my condolences to the families of the victims, and urge the security forces to do everything in their power to protect the lives and well-being of Egyptian citizens. I call on all sides to exercise maximum restraint." [...] During a visit to Cairo, Ashton met the interim president, Adly Mansour, but she also said that she regretted being unable to meet Morsi. She said: [...] "I believe he should be released. I was assured he is well. I would have liked to see him." ...|$|E

I carried it with me into all companies, into all occupations. Hardly anything had power to cause me even a few minutes' oblivion of it. For some months the cloud seemed to grow thicker and thicker.
