25|$|Back home at Little Creek, Virginia, Tucumcari {{continued}} its mission of demonstrating hydrofoil technology. Deployments included coastal surveillance with the U.S. Coast Guard out of Woods Hole, Massachusetts and further V.I.P. demonstrations at Annapolis, Maryland and Washington, D.C. On 16 November 1972, Tucumcari suffered a serious accident. While participating in simulated combat operations with other amphibious forces off Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, she unexpectedly ran aground. Hitting a coral reef at 40+ knots, Tucumcari was stopped dead within {{the length of}} her hull, forcing the <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> aft and shearing off the port and starboard foils. Several crewmen were injured and two crewmen had to be air lifted by helicopter from the grounded vessel. Fortunately, all the crewmen recovered from their injuries.|$|E
25|$|The revised GT-R {{features}} an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545bhp and 612Nm of torque from 3200 to 6000rpm. Changes {{also include a}} new more rigid <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. This new version is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment {{features an}}d USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.|$|E
25|$|The TRD Griffon Concept 014 {{is based}} on the 2013 TRD Griffon Concept. In turn, the 86 TRD Customize Concept 014 {{is based on}} the 86 TRD Griffon Concept 014, with roof fin, rear diffuser, HID bulb kit, winker bulb, full bucket driver seat, {{passenger}} sports seat, shoulder pad set, interior panel set (carbon), steering wheel and interior boot set, sport meter set (water temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure), leather shift knob (for manual transmission car), knee pad, battery clamp, fuel cap cover, full length adjustable suspension set, pillow upper set, stabilizer set (front, rear), <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> tower bar, member brace set, door stabilizer set, sports air filter, high response muffler Ver.R, sound changer, circuit brake kit, clutch cover, clutch disc (sport phasing), fly wheel, quick shift set (18-inch cast aluminium TRD TF6 18x7.5J-inch wheels, Goodyear EAGLE　RS　Sport　86spec 225/40R18 tires), lug nut set (M12×P1.25), oil filler cap, sport oil filter, radiator cap.|$|E

50|$|But at {{its first}} race in early April 1959, it became {{apparent}} that the handling was flawed, with the <b>front</b> <b>struts</b> bending and binding under racing loads. By the time the problem had been identified and rectified by the substitution of the <b>front</b> <b>struts</b> by more conventional wishbones (which was subsequently offered as a factory modification to all 17 owners), it was all too late and racing had moved on.|$|R
50|$|Braking and {{suspension}} were uprated to 284 mm ventilated front discs, {{a larger}} {{brake master cylinder}} and servo, as well as revised front springs, dampers, and <b>front</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Bullitt uses {{a version}} of the Mustang GT's {{aluminum}} 4.6L SOHC V8. It has a cold air intake, improved engine calibration, and a revised exhaust system designed to mimic the sound of the Mustang used in the Bullitt movie. Total output is 315hp (235kW) @ 6000rpm and 325lb·ft (440N·m) of torque @ 4250rpm and the engine's redline has been raised to 6500rpm (from the standard Mustang GT's 6250rpm). Premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline is recommended, although an adaptive spark ignition system allows the engine to accept regular grade gasoline. Total output is the same with either fuel, but the engine delivers a flatter torque curve when using premium. The Tremec TR3650 5-speed manual transmission from the Mustang GT is used, but the Bullitt featured a heavier duty rear axle (also used in GT500KR) with 3.73:1 ratio, versus the Mustang GT's 3.31:1 or optional 3:55:1 ratios. The suspension is improved over the standard GT utilizing stiffer springs, struts, and a decorative <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> tower brace while also lowering the car's ride height by six millimeters. Most of the Mustang Bullitt's components are available in the aftermarket for retrofitting earlier S197 Mustang GT vehicles, but some parts used in Bullitt Mustangs are marked to show authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Engineering wise, Holden {{kept the}} changes low key. A revised {{steering}} system and tweaked suspension tuning were {{among some of}} the changes to sharpen handling precision. Further improvements were made to the Generation III V8 engine to produce peak power of [...] for sports variants. In a bid to recapture the market for low-cost, high-performance cars, Holden created a new SV8 specification level. Based on the entry-level Executive, the SV8 inherited the V8 mechanical package from the SS but made do without the luxury appointments and was sold at a correspondingly lower price. Holden also experimented by releasing a limited edition wagon version of its high-performance SS variant, of which only 850 were built. The Series II update added a <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> bar as standard to the SS, which was claimed to increase rigidity and hence handling. As became the trend, the update raised V8 power, now up [...] Amendments in the remaining models were confined to new wheels, trims and decals, however, the Calais has taken on a sports-luxury persona as opposed to the discrete luxury character seen in previous models. This repositioning in turn affected the Berlina's standing. The once second-tier model now became the sole luxury model, only overshadowed by the more expensive Calais. Coinciding with the VY II models was the first four-door utility model dubbed the Holden Crewman. Crewman's underpinnings and body structure while somewhat unusual, shared a fair amount in common with the Statesman/Caprice, One tonner and the two-door Ute.|$|E

50|$|The first {{production}} car is widely {{thought to be}} the French 1949 Ford Vedette, but this was already developed before MacPherson with an independent front suspension based on wishbones and an upper coil spring. Only in 1954, after the Vedette factory had been purchased by Simca, did the revised Simca Vedette switch to using <b>front</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Mustang GT {{gained the}} same non-powertrain related {{upgrades}} that standard V6 Mustangs got for 2011. Other, new features exclusive to the 2011 Mustang GT included [...] "5.0" [...] fender badges replacing the [...] "GT" [...] badges used previously, an optional Brembo Brake Package includes 14 inch Brembo front disk brakes {{taken from the}} Shelby GT500, unique 19-inch wheels with Pirelli P-Zero ultra high performance summer only tires, a unique calibration of the Advanced Track stability system including a [...] "sport" [...] mode, and suspension enhancements such as stiffer springs (less aggressive than the BOSS 302 and Shelby models but {{more so than the}} regular GT models) and various other suspension enhancements. Convertible versions of the Mustang GT in particular received a <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> tower brace, stiffened crossmembers, and other enhancements resulting in a 12% increase in structural rigidity compared to 2010 Mustang GT convertibles. All 2011 Mustang GT's with 19inch wheels (brembo brake equipped, California special, etc.) also received the strut tower brace and stiffened cross members.|$|E
2500|$|The AMC Eagle SX/4 cars {{captured}} both {{second and}} third place the 1981 Sno*Drift Production Class rally held on Michigan's snow-covered gravel surface roads in January. Second in the Production Class and sixth overall were Henderson and Kloosterman. [...] "They were robbed of a nearly certain win in the class when the route was blocked on the 12th stage by John Woolf ... was in second place when the car slid {{on the ice and}} went straight into a bank tearing off the right <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> and setting the car straight across the road. Henderson was blocked and had to help clear the car from the road before he could continue. They lost two minutes, two places and a win in the class." [...] Third place Production and seventh overall in this two-day race in Grayling, Michigan, went to Guy Light and Jim Brandt. The finale of the 1981 SCCA ProRally season was held in Reno, Nevada. This is where Light and Brandt drove their AMC Eagle SX/4 to an eight-minute victory over the second-place finisher in the Production Class, as well as placing tenth overall.|$|E
50|$|For the 2013 model year, the GMC Terrain {{introduced}} the Denali trim {{which consists of}} more chrome trim and slightly improved interior quality, the 3.6L SIDI V6 that is shared with the 2012 Cadillac SRX {{in place of the}} optional 3.0L SIDI V6, and firmer <b>front</b> <b>struts.</b> The Denali also offers cross-traffic detection, blind-spot warning and a power passenger seat as options.|$|R
2500|$|The wing was {{a fabric}} covered {{semi-cantilever}} braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped Alclad ribs with Alclad sheet wrapped over leading edge.

50|$|The Evoluzione I had a wider track {{front and}} rear than earlier Deltas. The {{bodyside}} arches were extended and became more rounded. The wings were now made in a single pressing. The <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> top mounts were also raised, which necessitated a <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> brace. The new Integrale retained the four wheel drive layout. The engine was modified to produce 210 bhp (157 kW) at 5750 rpm.|$|E

50|$|The Lancia Prisma was a four-door, five-seat saloon {{with steel}} unibody construction, front-transverse mounted engines in block with the {{transaxle}} and all-independent suspension. Suspension consisted of MacPherson struts with offset telescopic dampers and coil springs, and anti-roll bars on both axles. The <b>front</b> <b>struts</b> were located by a stamped steel control arm and one radius rod; the rear by two parallel transverse links (the rearmost one adjustable for toe regulation) {{attached to a}} crossmember and one trailing link.|$|R
5000|$|The Evolution II was {{upgraded}} in December 1993, and {{was produced}} until February 1995. It consisted mainly of handling improvements, including minor wheelbase adjustments, lighter front swaybar that connected via swaybar {{links to the}} <b>front</b> <b>struts,</b> bodywork tweaks including a larger spoiler, and tires that were 10 mm wider. This Evolution also has a 50 L fuel tank. Power output was increased to [...] from the same engine and torque was unchanged for both GSR and RS models.|$|R
25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to <b>front</b> <b>struts</b> for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping in the <b>front</b> and rear <b>struts</b> for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|R
50|$|The MacPherson strut {{appears to}} have had little {{influence}} on Chapman at this time (although he would later use it unsuccessfully for the front suspension of his Lotus 17). Double wishbone suspension was already well-established for the front of high-performance cars. A <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> would also have required much greater height than was available in a racing car.|$|E
5000|$|A Ralliart version joined for 2007, finally {{upgrading}} the V6 to a class-competitive [...] while also adding a firmer suspension, <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> tower bar, rear stabilizer bar, and eighteen-inch alloy wheels. For 2008, the trimming of models left the Ralliart {{as the only}} V6 model, and the Galant skips the 2008 model year in Canada, only to return in 2009 with the facelifted model.|$|E
50|$|Differences between D2C and DEW98 {{are most}} {{noticeable}} in the suspension: The DEW98-based Lincoln LS uses a 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension. The D2C platform's MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} and solid axle rear suspension are less expensive to produce than DEW's more complicated setup. D2C also shares components with other Ford platforms. These include Ford's global C1 platform, with which D2C shares <b>front</b> <b>strut</b> and rear trailing arm components.|$|E
