60|$|The train {{made several}} stops, and {{at each of}} them shoals of country people filled the aisles, and paused for a most <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> with the senatorial candidate. Many called him Abe. His {{appearance}} was the equal in roughness to theirs, his manner if anything was more democratic,--yet {{in spite of all}} this Stephen in them detected a deference which might almost be termed a homage. There were many women among them. Had our friend been older, he might have known that the presence of good women in a political crowd portends something. As it was, he was surprised. He was destined to be still more surprised that day.|$|E
60|$|With {{regard to}} the more {{important}} part of your letter, I am under many difficulties. I am writing from a window which gives me a view of a little boat, gliding quietly about upon the surface of our basin of a lake. I should {{like to be in}} it, but what could I do with such a vessel {{in the heart of the}} Atlantic Ocean? As this boat would be to that navigation, so is my letter to the subject upon which you would set me afloat. Let me, however, say, that I have read your sermon (which I lately received from Longman) with much pleasure; I only gave it a cursory perusal, for since it arrived our family has been in great confusion, we having removed to another house, in which we are not yet half settled. The Appendix I had received before in a frank, and of that I feel myself more entitled to speak, because I had read it more at leisure. I am entirely of accord with you in chiefly recommending religious books for the poor; but of many of those which you recommend I can neither speak in praise nor blame, as I have never read them. Yet, as far as my own observation goes, which has been mostly employed upon agricultural persons in thinly-peopled districts, I cannot find that there is much disposition to read among the labouring classes, or much occasion for it. Among manufacturers and persons engaged in sedentary employments, it is, I know, very different. The labouring man in agriculture generally carries on his work either in solitude or with his own family--with persons whose minds he is thoroughly acquainted with, and with whom he is under no temptation to enter into discussions, or to compare opinions. He goes home from the field, or the barn, and within and about his own house he finds a hundred little jobs which furnish him with a change of employment which is grateful and profitable; then comes supper, and bed. This for week-days. For sabbaths, he goes to church with us often or mostly twice a day; on coming home, some one turns to the Bible, finds the text, and probably reads the chapter whence it is taken, or perhaps some other; and in the afternoon the master or mistress frequently reads the Bible, if alone; and on this day the mistress of the house almost always teaches the children to read, or as they express it, hears them a lesson; or if not thus employed, they visit their neighbours, or receive them in their own houses as they drop in, and keep up by the hour a slow and <b>familiar</b> <b>chat.</b> This kind of life, of which I have seen much, and which I know would be looked upon with little complacency by many religious persons, is peaceable, and as innocent as (the frame of society and the practices of government being what they are) we have a right to expect; besides, it is much more intellectual than a careless observer would suppose. One of our neighbours, who lives as I have described, was yesterday walking with me; and as we were pacing on, talking about indifferent matters, by the side of a brook, he suddenly said to me, with great spirit and a lively smile, 'I like to walk where I can hear the sound of a beck!' (the word, as you know, in our dialect for a brook). I cannot but think that this man, without being conscious of it, has had many devout feelings connected with the appearances which have presented themselves to him in his employment as a shepherd, and that the pleasure of his heart at that moment was an acceptable offering to the Divine Being. But to return to the subject of books. I find among the people I am speaking of, halfpenny ballads and penny and two-penny histories in great abundance; these are often bought as charitable tributes to the poor persons who hawk them about (and it is the best way of procuring them). They are frequently stitched together in tolerably thick volumes, and such I have read; some of the contents, though not often religious, very good; others objectionable, either for the superstition in them, such as prophecies, fortune-telling, &c., or more frequently for indelicacy. I have so much felt the influence of these straggling papers, that I have many a time wished that I had talents to produce songs, poems, and little histories that might circulate among other good things in this way, supplanting partly the bad flowers and useless herbs, and to take place of weeds. Indeed, some of the poems which I have published were composed, not without a hope that at some time or other they might answer this purpose. The kind of library which you recommend would not, I think, for the reasons given above, be of much direct use in any of the agricultural districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland with which I am acquainted, though almost every person here can read; I mean of general use as to morals or behaviour. It might, however, with individuals, do much in awakening enterprise, calling forth ingenuity, and fostering genius. I have known several persons who would eagerly have sought, not after these books merely, but any books, and would have been most happy in having such a collection to repair to. The knowledge thus acquired would also have spread, by being dealt about in conversation among their neighbours, at the door, and by the fire-side; so that it is not easy to foresee how far the good might extend; and harm I can see none which would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantage. The situation of manufacturers is deplorably different. The monotony of their employments renders some sort of stimulus, intellectual or bodily, absolutely necessary for them. Their work is carried on in clusters,--men from different parts of the world, and perpetually changing; so that every individual is constantly in the way of being brought into contact with new notions and feelings, and being unsettled in his own accordingly; a select library, therefore, in such situations may be of the same use as a public dial, keeping everybody's clock in some kind of order.|$|E

50|$|Males form territories, 7.5 - 49 ha large (the size {{depends on}} {{rainfall}} patterns), {{in which they}} stay with their partners and offspring. Males are generally more vigilant than females. Klipspringer form large dung heaps, nearly 1 m across and 10 cm deep, at the borders of territories; another form of marking is the secretion of a thick, black substance, measuring 5 mm across, from the preorbital glands onto vegetation and rocks in the territories. A study revealed that the tick Ixodes neitzi detects and aggregates on twigs marked by the klipspringer. Another study showed that plants near the borders with neighbouring territories are particularly preferred for marking. The main vocalisation is a shrill whistle, given out be the klipspringer pair in a duet, {{as a means of}} communication or anti-predator response. Predators include the baboon, black-backed jackal, caracal, eagle, leopard, martial eagle, serval, spotted hyaena and Verreaux's eagle. Birds such as <b>familiar</b> <b>chats,</b> pale-winged starlings, red-winged starlings and yellow-bellied bulbuls have been observed feeding on ectoparasites of klipspringer.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} smaller than the Karoo chat which also has {{the white of the}} outer tail {{feathers}} extending to the tip. It is paler and greyer than <b>Familiar</b> and sickle-winged <b>chats,</b> both of which have a darker rump.|$|R
50|$|The {{contrast}} between the dark upperparts and the much paler underparts distinguish this species from the more uniformly coloured <b>familiar</b> <b>chat.</b> It also has the pale salmon-buff on the rump extending only onto {{the base of the}} tail, whereas the <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> has a richer hue which almost reaches the tip of the tail.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> was {{illustrated}} {{and described}} by the French naturalist Fran√ßois Levaillant in Volume 4 of his Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique published in 1805. He named the bird, [...] "Le Traquet Familier" [...] but did not give the species a binomial name. The binomial name Motacilla familiaris was introduced by the English publisher John Wilkes in 1817. The species was subsequently placed in the genus Cercomela introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the <b>familiar</b> <b>chat,</b> phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe. As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> {{was moved to the}} genus Oenanthe.|$|E
50|$|The {{format is}} {{loosely based on}} BBC1's {{political}} discussion show, Question Time, though it also contains elements that are more <b>familiar</b> to daytime <b>chat</b> shows. In the first four series, each show featured four panellists {{from a range of}} different religious and ethical perspectives, {{as well as a number}} of contributors from the live studio audience. In Series 5, the panel was dropped, and the debates took place entirely within the audience, which still featured a number of contributors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the design and}} development of a participatory calculus textbook offered as a subscription site on the Internet. The project contains nearly 19, 000 HTML files presenting the complete single and multivariable calculus curriculum {{in addition to a}} wealth of supplemental content. As an interactive multimedia textbook, it integrates text, graphics, animation, simulation, and live mathematics. The text also features collaborative environments similar to the <b>familiar</b> online <b>chat</b> and news. We call the convergence of interactive multimedia course materials with context-sensitive collaborative environments a participatory document. The structure of this project represents over four years of design research while implementation represents several personyears. Hundreds of students have used the text and based partly on their feedback, we are now preparing a number of additional projects. We present the principles developed in designing, implementing, and hosting participatory textbooks and show the applicability {{to a wide range of}} disciplines...|$|R
60|$|A personable {{youth was}} Pemberton, and {{had brought with}} him from the wilds of Canada a sable-lined {{overcoat}} which was the envy of every masculine and the admiration of every feminine friend he had, and as he stood at her carriage window Rose knew that this luxurious garment and its stalwart wearer were objects {{of interest to the}} passersby.

50|$|The <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> (Oenanthe familiaris), {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is {{a common}} resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara in rocky and mountainous habitat and around human habitation.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the more}} notable species {{recorded}} are pied-winged swallow (Hirundo leucosoma), white-crowned robin-chat (Cossypha albicapillus), Botta's wheatear (Oenanthe bottae), <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> (Cercomela familiaris), white-fronted black-chat (Myrmecocichla albifrons), mocking cliff-chat (Thamnolaea cinnamomeiventris), common rock thrush (Monticola saxitilis), Senegal eremomela (Eremomela pusilla), blackcap babbler (Turdoides reinwardtii), red-winged pytilia (Pytilia phoenicoptera), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes), bush petronia (Petronia dentata) and Togo paradise-whydah (Vidua togoensis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> is {{typically}} seen {{sitting on a}} rock, or hopping on bare patches of soil. It has a habit of flicking its wings once or twice every time it moves. It is seen in small family groups of up to five birds, and is invariably tame and approachable. It eats insects, fruit, animal fat and household or farmyard scraps.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> is a dumpy short-tailed bird [...] long. The adult‚Äôs upperparts are a dull {{brown with}} warmer brown ear coverts behind the eye. The underparts vary from off-white to pale grey-brown, and the rump and outer tail {{feathers}} are rufous {{with a dark}} brown tip. The central tail feathers are dark brown. The short straight bill and the legs and feet are black. The sexes are alike, but the juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult but has buff spots above and a scaly pattern on the breast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> is monogamous. It breeds between December and March {{in most of}} west Africa, {{but between}} March and May in Nigeria and mainly between October and November in South Africa. It builds a thick {{cup-shaped}} nest of plant material lined with hair, wool and feathers. The nest is usually placed in {{a hole in the}} ground, but rock faces and buildings are also used. This species will use nest boxes or a disused sociable weaver nest. The clutch is 2-4 greenish-blue eggs decorated with reddish-brown speckling. The eggs hatch after 13-15 days. The nestlings are fed by both parents and fledge after 13-15 days. Usually only a single brood is raised each year.|$|E
50|$|Sociable weavers {{construct}} permanent nests {{on trees}} and other tall objects. These nests {{are the largest}} built by any bird, and are large enough to house over a hundred pairs of birds, containing several generations at a time. The nests are highly structured and provide birds with a more advantageous temperature relative to the outside. The central chambers retain heat and are used for nighttime roosting. The outer rooms are used for daytime shade and maintain temperatures of 7-8 degrees Celsius inside while outside temperatures may range from 16-33 degrees Celsius. Sociable weaver nests are used commensally by several other bird species, most commonly the pygmy falcon. Whereas this falcon is mostly believed to be an indifferent in most places, instances of predation of sociable weaver nestlings and animosity with the weavers has been reported from some sites in Kimberley. Red-headed finches and rosy-faced lovebird use the nests for breeding while other bird species such as acacia pied barbet, <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> and ashy tit may use it for roosting. Larger birds like owls and vultures use the nest as a platform {{to build their own}} nests.|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{investigation}} of the foraging site utilised by avian species may reveal the habitat factors important in their conservation. This study compared the foraging sites of the Sunlark, Galerida modesta and Familiar Chart, Cercomela familiaris (both African resident insectivorous birds) a week after fire engulfed about {{one third of the}} 300 ha of the Amurum Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Foraging sites were compared based on proxies of food availability (ant, grasshopper and other insect abundance) and vegetation structure. Data on food availability and vegetation structures were obtained by quadrate sampling while foraging spots were determined from four stratified transects each surveyed four times during the study. Food availability was not a significant predictor of foraging site characteristics between the two bird species. However of the nine vegetation variables measured, grass height and proportion of burned grass cover per foraging site significantly distinguished the foraging sites of the two bird species; Sunlark foraged more at sites with shorter grasses and high proportion of burned grass cover as compared to the <b>Familiar</b> <b>Chat.</b> The characteristics of the foraging sites observed might have implications on the foraging success of the birds in line with literature on the Influences of vegetation structure on avian foraging behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} a {{promising}} alternative to alleviating fossil fuel-based dependencies, but its development can require {{a complex set}} of environmental trade-offs for bird communities in the area, ranging from effective and physical habitat loss to direct collision-related mortality. The wide variation in the nature and significance of predicted impacts of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) facilities on birds, and the low levels of confidence attending these predictions, has emphasised the need for scientific research. This study assesses the risks to bird populations and guilds at one of South Africa's largest PV developments. Firstly, in order to identify functional and structural changes in bird communities in and around the development footprint, bird transect data were gathered, representing the solar development, boundary, and untransformed landscape. Secondly, to assess the risk of collision mortality with solar-related infrastructure, representative samples (core vs. edge) were surveyed for bird carcasses and other signs of collision for three months covering 20 - 30 % of the facility at search intervals of 4, 7 and 14 days. In order to account for potential biases in carcass detection, searcher efficiency and carcass persistence trials were conducted. The distribution of birds in the landscape changed, from a shrubland to open country and grassland bird community, in response to changes in the distribution and abundance of habitat resources such as food, water and nesting sites. These changes in resource availability patterns were detrimental to some bird species and beneficial to others. Shrubland specialists, such as the black-chested prinia (Prinia flavicans) and chestnut-vented tit-babbler (Parisoma subcaeruleum), appeared to be negatively affected by the presence of the PV facility. In contrast, open country/grassland and generalist species, especially species such as the Cape sparrow (Passer melanurus) and <b>familiar</b> <b>chat</b> (Cercomela familiaris), were favoured by its development. Utility-scale PV facilities inevitably will not substitute for the natural habitats they have replaced, but might offer opportunities for climate protection that do not necessarily conflict with nature conservation. Monitoring success of avian mortality was significantly influenced by variation in detection rates by size class (60 and 95 % for birds 100 g, respectively) and the location of carcasses relative to the solar panel units (65 and 90 % for birds adjacent and under the units, respectively) as well as decreasing persistence rates per search interval (57, 53, and 40 % after 4, 7, and 14 days, respectively). Only injuries associated with non-fatal collision of large-bodied birds with the underside of the panels and entrapment between fencing could be concluded with reasonable certainty. An extrapolated fatality estimate of 4. 53 fatalities. MW‚Åª¬π. yr‚Åª¬π (95 % CI 1. 51 - 8. 50), short study period, and lack of comparable results from other sources made it difficult to provide a meaningful assessment on avian mortality at PV facilities. Despite these limitations, the few bird fatalities that were recorded might suggest that there is no significant link with collision-related mortality at the study site. In order to fully understand the risk of solar energy development on birds, further collation and analysis of data from solar energy facilities across spatial and temporal scales, based on scientifically rigorous research designs, is required...|$|E
