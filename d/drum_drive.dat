Prior to its introduction, a rope <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> controlled the rudder.

5000|$|Lucas Oil Stadium has a {{retractable}} roof {{designed by}} Uni-Systems that, like the Veltins-Arena, divides lengthwise into two retractable panels, with each half {{sliding down the}} sloping roof of the stadium into the open position. The stadium roof is gabled, with the peak {{in the center of}} the field, paralleling the sidelines. A cable <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> system drives the retractable roof panels up and down the sloped track. Rather than dragging the 1½" [...] diameter galvanized cables across the fixed roof, this system's patented design lays the roof cable down, and then picks it back up. In nine minutes, the roof panels will simultaneously move to the open position at the touch of a button. To guard the stadium's interior from weather conditions the roof is designed with a large cap that will run the length of a sealed overlap between the parting roof panels. Just beneath the sealed overlap is a large trough, finalizing the retractable roof's layers of protection. It is the only retractable roof in the country with two moving panels that will meet in a peak above the center of the stadium. The roof boasts the largest opening—a 4.5 acre hole to the sky—of all current and planned NFL stadiums with retractable roofs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a detailed mathematical {{model of a}} casting <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> in a web production process. The drive uses a at belt to connect the casting drum itself to a drive and a brake pulley. The model includes mechanical effects, such as creep and slip between the belt and pulleys, and its parameters are obtained {{by a combination of}} calculations and experimental tests. Experimental results from a laboratory-scale model of a commercial casting drum system are used to validate the model under steady-state and transient conditions. A companion paper describes the model’s application in new controller strategies, which signicantly reduce drum speed variations caused by web tension changes...|$|E

Drying experiments were carried out by drying fermented ground cassava particles in a bench scale rotary dryer at inlet air temperatures of 115 – 230 °C, air velocities of 0. 83 [*]m/s– 1. 55 [*]m/s, feed mass of 50 – 500 [*]g, <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> speed of 8 [*]rpm, and feed drive speed of 100 [*]rpm to validate the model.

40|$|A Grapple Hoist Assembly is {{currently}} {{used on the}} Rotary Mode Core Sampling Trucks (RMCSTs) to actuate the sampler and retrieve the pintle rod during sampling operations. The hoist assembly includes a driven drum approximately two inches wide and six inches in diameter that rotates to pay out or reel in the 5 / 32 -in. cable The current Grapple Hoist Assembly, detailed on drawing H- 2 - 690057, is prone to ''bird nesting'' the cable on the drum. ''Bird nesting'' is {{a condition in which}} the cable does not wind onto the drum in a uniformly layered manner, but winds in a random fashion where the cable essentially ''piles up'' inappropriately on the drum and, on some occasions, winds on the <b>drum</b> <b>drive</b> shaft. A system to help control this ''bird nesting'' problem has been designed as an addition to the existing components of the Grapple Hoist Assembly. The new design consists of a mechanism that is timed with, and driven by, the shaft that drives the drum. This mechanism traverses {{back and forth across the}} width of the drum to lay the cable on the drum in a uniformly layered manner. This test plan establishes the acceptance criteria, test procedure and test conditions It also describes the test apparatus necessary to verify the adequacy of the level wind system design. The test is defined as qualification testing (LMHC 1999 b) and as such will be performed at conditions beyond the parameters that the Grapple Hoist Assembly is allowed to operate by the Safety Equipment List (SEL) (LMHC 1998) ...|$|E

40|$|Power is a {{critical}} consideration in planning exploration of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and places beyond. Nuclear power is an important option, especially for locations {{in the solar system}} where sunlight is limited or environmental conditions are challenging (e. g., extreme cold, dust storms). NASA and the Department of Energy are maintaining the option for fission surface power for the Moon and Mars by developing and demonstrating technology for a fission surface power system. The Fission Surface Power Systems project has focused on subscale component and subsystem demonstrations to address the feasibility of a low-risk, low-cost approach to space nuclear power for surface missions. Laboratory demonstrations of the liquid metal pump, reactor control <b>drum</b> <b>drive,</b> power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution technologies have validated that the fundamental characteristics and performance of these components and subsystems are consistent with a Fission Surface Power preliminary reference concept. In addition, subscale versions of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, using electric resistance heating in place of the reactor fuel, have been built and operated with liquid metal sodium-potassium and helium/xenon gas heat transfer loops, demonstrating the viability of establishing system-level performance and characteristics of fission surface power technologies without requiring a nuclear reactor. While some component and subsystem testing will continue through 2011 and beyond, the results to date provide sufficient confidence to proceed with system level technology readiness demonstration. To demonstrate the system level readiness of fission surface power in an operationally relevant environment (the primary goal of the Fission Surface Power Systems project), a full scale, 1 / 4 power Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is under development. The TDU will consist of a non-nuclear reactor simulator, a sodium-potassium heat transfer loop, a power conversion unit with electrical controls, and a heat rejection system with a multi-panel radiator assembly. Testing is planned at the Glenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 6 starting in 2012, with vacuum and liquid-nitrogen cold walls to provide simulation of operationally relevant environments. A nominal two-year test campaign is planned including a Phase 1 reactor simulator and power conversion test followed by a Phase 2 integrated system test with radiator panel heat rejection. The testing is expected to demonstrate the readiness and availability of fission surface power as a viable power system option for NASA's exploration needs. In addition to surface power, technology development work within this project is also directly applicable to in-space fission power and propulsion systems...|$|E
