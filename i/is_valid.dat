Louis and his new wife were within the prohibited degree of kinship, because Louis's mother and his wife's grandmother were cousins, but they applied for a papal dispensation only about four months after their marriage. Historian Iván Bertényi says that this haste suggests that Elizabeth, who had been living in the court of Louis's mother, was pregnant {{at the time of the}} marriage. If this theory <b>is</b> <b>valid,</b> Louis's and his wife's first child was stillborn. Their next child, Catherine, was born in 1370 and died in 1378.
