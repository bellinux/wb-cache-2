25|$|One morning late in 1954, Lowe {{organised}} a rare closed-door {{discussion with}} his vice presidents in his office. Lowe announced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice</b> {{that he had}} contracted tuberculosis. He withdrew from {{the operation of the}} company with immediate effect in order to undergo treatment. Surviving from tuberculosis depended on early detection, regular medication, at least nine months of nearly absolute inactivity, and in extreme cases, surgery.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{section of}} the song to feature bass is the bridge, {{opposing}} {{the rest of the}} song. This portion has Reznor singing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> The remaining quarters follow, ending with manipulated and looped guitar noises made by Belew, who was invited by Reznor to the production. Like [...] "March of the Pigs", [...] "A Warm Place" [...] and [...] "Reptile", the song is played in the Drop D tuning.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2009 book Recollections of President Lincoln and his Administration, author L.E. Chittenden {{argues that}} {{there was no need for}} any precautions, such as a disguise, because Lincoln [...] "entered the sleeping–car at Philadelphia, and slept until awakened within a few miles of Washington." [...] That account contradicts other firsthand accounts, which state that Lincoln spent a sleepless and anxious night with Lamon and Pinkerton, during which he [...] "spoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice</b> to avoid being noticed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alice is a 14-year-old undine for Orange Planet. She first appears (in volume 3 of Aria/episode 3 of Aria the Animation) as a standoffish, {{detached}} girl. Aika later {{describes her}} as anti-social and complains about her tendency {{to put on}} a grim face and speak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> Alice speaks in a deadpan manner, though she frequently uses [...] as an intensifier. Although initially only a Pair, her rowing already surpasses both Aika and Akari's—for which skill she was scouted by Orange Planet despite her young age. Despite working for rival companies, Alice, Akari, and Aika often practice together, and Alice sincerely enjoys the others' company, though this does not stop her from telling them to be quiet when they argue. Because of her age and lower status, Aika often addresses her as [...] Through her friendship with Akari and Aika, Alice lightens up as the series progresses, though she still struggles with her detachment.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pardon me for contradicting Your Majesty," [...] {{returned}} Quox <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "but I don't believe you'll perform {{any more}} magic." ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly the {{old woman}} with the basket glanced up and, {{speaking}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> matter-of-fact <b>voice</b> but with a foreign accent, said: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{tears were}} {{trembling}} in Dinah's eyes, and they fell {{before she could}} answer. But she spoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> low <b>voice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Guards,' {{she said}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> choked <b>voice,</b> and {{pointing}} at the fair but unconscious disciple of Wackford Squeers, 'slay me that woman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] said he, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "if {{you will}} but stand aside {{there will be}} some murder done among them first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Stannard {{refused to}} marry me," [...] Jimmy replied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "But {{we were talking}} about the insurance. I rather urged Stannard--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand ready, lads!" [...] said Lumley <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> {{bringing}} {{forward the}} muzzle of his gun, [...] "there's no saying what may come of this." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Steady, partner; we'll soon be across," [...] he said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> reassuring <b>voice,</b> and Lawrence's slack pose stiffened, {{as if he}} had {{gathered}} confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it seems," [...] {{she said}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice</b> that {{nevertheless}} gave a Foster a thrill. [...] "The charm of rashness {{is a favorite}} subject of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will shine again to-morrow," [...] Blanca {{answered}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "The shadows {{have long}} rested on {{this country of}} ours, but one looks for the dawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The road is {{long and}} the heart may grow cold," [...] was the answer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "If he does not return it is because he has forgotten." ...|$|E
60|$|She turned very pale, and {{answered}} him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold, <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> every syllable of which fell upon {{him like the}} stroke of a knife.|$|R

6000|$|... "My object's not to play," [...] said Jimmy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Anyhow, {{before you}} start to work you must get proper tools. Suppose {{you tell me what}} I need?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{we discuss}} that," [...] he said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small, <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "let us {{go into a}} private room. I have {{something}} very particular to say." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{seemed not}} to have listened to him. When he stopped, she said, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> passionless <b>voice,</b> [...] "I suppose you wrote it to get money for this sacque." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] remarked the latter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Come here, my man," [...] he added, taking the shopkeeper {{apart from the}} crowd, and {{questioning}} him closely.|$|E
