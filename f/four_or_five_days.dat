5|$|The {{number of}} nations playing Test cricket {{increased}} gradually over time, {{with the addition}} of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952.

5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days.</b> On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E

The Weasels are very loosely organized with membership requirements being simply <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>day's</b> participation as a course worker at a Weasel-supported Whistler ski race.

Each year in April a well dressing competition is organised around a theme {{set by the}} Malvern Spa Association, with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards presented to adult's and children's groups. The well dressing initiative usually takes place {{over a period of}} <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> with the Malvern spouts starting the annual season of well dressing around the country in the Derbyshire tradition. In 2003, photographer Bob Bilsland gave permission to the BBC to publish 21 of his special panaoramic views of the decorated wells and spouts.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{also noticed}} these {{vacancies}} in the lineup; he was dissatisfied {{in the role}} of a pitcher who appeared every <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.|$|E
5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> and may continue through incubation.|$|E
40|$|Optimizing {{regeneration}} {{of cotton}} plant in two variety (Sahel and Varamin) via shoot apex {{was done in}} order to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In this reaserch shoot apexes of two varieties were isolated from <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>day</b> seedling and were placed on a special medium of shooting (modified MS without hormon). In order to select the best rooting media, The Statistical Analysis explants that produce shoot and leaves in a CRBD with 4 replicates and 4 rooting treatments: 1) modified MS without hormon, 2) ½ MS with 0. 1 mg/lit IBA, 3) ½ MS with 0. 1 mg/lit NAA, 4) ½ MS with 0. 1 mg/lit IAA. The statistical analysis indicated that the best for both varieties, was medium with 0. 1 mg/lit IBA and rooting percentage of Varamin is better than sahel in all of media...|$|R

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days</b> ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower for <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow {{as big as the}} stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

40|$|Extract:In Australia when {{we think}} of {{mediation}} training, we generally envisage a <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>day</b> training course run by a mediation service provider or educational institution. Many Australian universities also offer postgraduate studies in mediation and ADR which generally provide a combination of theory and skills development subjects. Such studies typically take the form of postgraduate diplomas or Masters degrees offered by a university department or a multi-disciplinary mediation centre. Notably, there are no requirements that participants have previous qualifications or experience in mediation. One direct effect of this ‘open’ policy has been to lower the standard of postgraduate teaching and learning in this field. For example, postgraduate subjects in mediation in many law schools around the country offer a standard of instruction which is not dissimilar to that being offered at other schools on an undergraduate level. In fact, in some schools undergraduates sit in the same sessions with postgraduates and legal professionals enrolled in a certificate course...|$|R

25|$|An adult {{butterfly}} emerges {{after about}} two weeks as a chrysalid, and hangs upside down until its wings are dry. Fluids are pumped into the wings, and they expand and stiffen. The monarch expands and retracts its wings, and once conditions allow, it then flies and feeds {{on a variety of}} nectar plants. During the breeding season adults reach sexual maturity in <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>days,</b> however, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete. Monarchs typically live for two to five weeks during their breeding season. Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared to lower densities.|$|E
