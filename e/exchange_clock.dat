5000|$|SWCC {{imprinted}} all {{of their}} movements with serial numbers. The serial numbers were used for inventory purposes and were assigned in ascending order. It is possible to approximately date the time of manufacture of a movement based on the serial number. The first [...] "F" [...] movements were made in 1898 and were made into the 1940s. However, {{it is not possible}} to automatically date a particular clock by the movement serial number. SWCC had a practice of <b>exchanging</b> <b>clock</b> movements rather than servicing a movement and then returning it to the same clock. This results in rarely finding a SWCC clock with its original movement. Identification tag numbers also often do not match movement serial numbers because the tags were not changed when the movement was exchanged. The total number of [...] "F" [...] movements manufactured could be confusing. The lowest serial numbers are in the 33,000 range and the highest is in the 402,000 range. There were large numbering gaps and it has been calculated that probably around 200,000 movements were produced.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to {{automatic}} systems, the subscriber rang {{an operator}} who would quote {{the time from}} a central clock in the exchange with a phrase such as [...] "The time by the <b>exchange</b> <b>clock</b> is...". This was not precise and the operator could not always answer when the subscriber wanted. In 1954, British-made systems were installed in Melbourne and Sydney. The mechanical speaking clock used rotating glass discs where {{different parts of the}} time were recorded on the disc. A synchronous motor drove the disc with the driving source derived from a 5 MHz Quartz Oscillator via a multi stage valve divider. This was amplified to give sufficient impetus to drive the motor. Because of the low torque available, a hand wheel was used to spin the motor on start up. The voice was provided by Gordon Gow. The units were designed for continuous operation. Both units in Melbourne and Sydney were run in tandem (primary and backup). For daylight saving time changes, one would be on line while the second was advanced or delayed by one hour and at the 02:00:00 Australian Eastern Standard time, would be switched over to the standby unit.|$|E

40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} {{is a very}} fundamental task in distributed system. It thus {{makes sense}} to require an underlying clock synchronization mechanism to be highly fault-tolerant. A self-stabilizing algorithm seeks to attain synchronization once lost; a Byzantine algorithm assumes synchronization is never lost and focuses on containing {{the influence of the}} permanent presence of faulty nodes. There are efficient self-stabilizing solutions for clock synchronization as well as efficient solutions that are resilient to Byzantine faults. In contrast, {{to the best of our}} knowledge there is no practical solution that is self-stabilizing while tolerating the permanent presence of Byzantine nodes. We present the first linear-time self-stabilizing Byzantine clock synchronization algorithm. Our deterministic clock synchronization algorithm is based on the observation that all clock synchronization algorithms require events for <b>exchanging</b> <b>clock</b> values and re-synchronizing the clocks to within safe bounds. These events usually need to happen synchronously at the different nodes. In classic Byzantine algorithms this is fulfilled or aided by having the clocks initially close to each other and thus the actual clock values can be used for synchronizing the events. This implies that clock values cannot differ arbitrarily, which necessarily renders these solutions to be non-stabilizing. Our scheme suggests using an underlying distributed pulse synchronization module that is uncorrelated to the clock values. Comment: This is a corrected version.

Based on the clock synchronization state space model, this paper establishes the model of synchronization error variance analysis and design issues. In the analysis issue, assuming sensor nodes <b>exchange</b> <b>clock</b> information in the network with packet loss, we find a minimum clock information packet arrival rate in order to guarantee the synchronization precision at synchronization node. In the design issue, assuming sensor node freely schedules whether to send the clock information, we look for an optimal clock information exchange rate between synchronization node and reference node which offers the optimal tradeoff between energy consumption and synchronization precision at synchronization node. Finally, simulations further verify the validity of clock synchronization analysis and design from the perspective of synchronization error variance...|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, the {{measurement}} of time dilation at everyday speeds has been accomplished as well. Chou et al. (2010) created two clocks each holding a single 27Al+ ion in a Paul trap.

The two clocks were situated in separate laboratories and connected with a 75 m long, phase-stabilized optical fiber for <b>exchange</b> of <b>clock</b> signals. These optical atomic clocks emitted frequencies in the petahertz (1 PHz = 1015 Hz) range and had frequency uncertainties in the 10−17 range. With these clocks, it was possible to measure a frequency shift due to time dilation of ∼10−16 at speeds below 36 km/h (< 10 m/s, the speed of a fast runner) by comparing the rates of moving and resting aluminum ions. It was also possible to detect gravitational time dilation from a difference in elevation between the two clocks of 33 cm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Timing {{synchronization}} is {{a critical}} requirement for implementation {{of a number of}} performance-enhancing strategies in mesh networks, including Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) for more efficient resource usage, and sleep scheduling for power efficiency. While there is a significant body of prior work on distributed timing synchronization, it requires explicit exchange of timestamps; in addition, algorithms trying to synchronize clock frequencies as well as phases typically require <b>exchange</b> of <b>clock</b> rate estimates as well. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of overhead-free maintenance of timing synchronization in a TDM-based mesh network, using only the information obtained from the timing of existing communication in the network: each node updates its clock rate and phase only when it receives a packet, depending on the difference between the expected and actual packet arrival times. While the algorithm is asynchronous (only a subset of nodes perform updates on any given slot), we exploit the law of large numbers to provide fundamental theoretical insight by analyzing an averaged, synchronous system. We demonstrate using simulations that a distributed, asynchronous algorithm designed based on prescriptions from the averaged system achieves phase and time synchrony. I...|$|R

This issue has gained increasing importance with the emergence of new resource constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a new distributed clock synchronization algorithm, referred to as Weighted Consensus Clock Synchronization (WCCS), whose objective is to achieve a consensus clock among network nodes. In this distributed approach and in contrast to centralized schemes, each node periodically <b>exchanges</b> the local <b>clock</b> reading with its immediate neighbor nodes. Then, each node employs these time informations to calculate its relative offset and skew with respect to its neighbor nodes using a weighted average consensus based technique.

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{clock synchronization}} protocol is presented which achieves {{a very high}} precision {{without the need for}} very frequent resynchronizations.

At the end of each round, <b>clock</b> times are <b>exchanged</b> between the <b>clocks.</b> Each clock applies a convergence function (CF) to the values obtained.

50|$|Speedskating World (SSW) is an {{international}} magazine devoted to news and discussions pertaining to speed skating and speedskaters. The magazine is the only English-language publication of its kind, and has had subscribers in more than twenty-five countries. The SSW first saw light in 1995, and typically publishes eight issues a year. It has a broad outlook on speedskating, featuring articles and interviews related to athletes, coaches, politics, sports medicine, training regimes, equipment, statistics, Olympics, championships, history, and the broad fan culture associated with these aspects. Around twenty different Olympic champions have been specially interviewed for the SSW, many of them before they won their medals. The natural emphasis of the SSW is on classical long-track speedskating (where athletes race in pairs on 400-m rinks, against each other and against the <b>clock,</b> <b>exchanging</b> inner and outer lanes on the backstretch), but some space is also devoted to short track and marathon skating races.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Oversampled delta-sigma {{modulation}} {{is one of}} the widely used A/D conversion techniques for narrow bandwidth signals. In this study several new lowpass and bandpass delta-sigma modulator architectures as well as novel pseudo-N-path integrators {{that can be used in}} implementing these architectures are proposed. By using multiplexing techniques the new lowpass delta-sigma modulator architectures <b>exchange</b> higher <b>clock</b> rates with hardware complexity. For a given oversampling ratio (OSR), the multiplexed first-order delta-sigma modulator achieves a higher resolution. Guaranteed stability is a very desirable feature of these structures. The multi-loop delta-sigma modulator architecture similarly reduces the number of integrators needed to achieve high-resolution conversion for a given OSR. To ensure stability a quantizer with (N+ 1) bits must be used, where N is the number of loops, or in other words, the order of the delta-sigma modulator. Digital correction or randomizing techniques can be used to eliminate the performance reduction due to digital-to-analog- (D/A) converter nonlinearity error [59], [64]. Bandpass delta-sigma modulators are useful for applications such as AM radio receivers, spectrum analyzers, and digital wireless systems. Using z [...] > -z[superscript N] or z [...] > z[superscript N] mapping, a low pass delta-sigma modulator can be transformed to a bandpass one. One of the methods to implement the loop filters in bandpass delta-sigma modulators is to use Pseudo-N-Path (PNP) switched-capacitor (SC) integrators. The advantage is that the center frequency occurs exactly at an integer division of the sampling frequency because of the number of physical paths. To achieve maximum resolution, integrators that do not suffer from clock feedthrough peaks are needed. The proposed differential and single-ended novel PNP integrators address this problem [76]. To keep the opamp specifications less stringent while achieving high resolution, these PNP integrators have been further improved with gain compensation techniques [53]...|$|R
40|$|In Mida Creek, Kenya (3 ° 20 ′S, 40 ° 5 ′E), at high water, {{the snail}} Cerithidea decollata dwells on {{the trunks of}} {{mangrove}} trees (Avicennia marina), while during low water it migrates to the ground, foraging at various distances from the trunk, where it aggregates again well before the incoming tide. Snails from the upper shore level are 150 - 200 m distant from those living at the lower shore level and they cluster at lower heights on trunks. In any case, sufficient height is usually attained to avoid being submersed. An experiment was designed (February and October 2005), exchanging individuals from different shore levels subject to different tide regimes, {{in order to test}} whether snails rely on internal information or on external, direct cues, to adapt their behaviour to local conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{satellite}} based navigation {{system that can}} be used to locate positions anywhere on earth and proper timing determination. The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate, stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to provide world-wide position and time determination. As a result of their motion and being in the earth gravitational field, these clocks are subject to one of the relativity effects known as time dilation and without carefully accounting for this effect, the system would not work. This research work discussed the concept and effect of special and general relativity on GPS navigation as well as using Karl Schwarzschild time dilation equation to estimate time error. Signals <b>exchanged</b> by atomic <b>clocks</b> at different altitudes are subject to general relativistic effects described using the Schwarzschild metric and neglecting these effects would make the GPS errorfull. Applying the Kerl Schwarzchild time dilation equation in the obtained GPS data set, as measured at the orbit of the satellite, we found a difference between the proper time and the coordinate time whish gave us the dilated time within the range of 0. 7 - 0. 9 seconds. The dilated time for signal to travel from the orbit to the receiving station is what we regarded as Time Error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For many applications, {{distributed}} networks {{require the}} local clocks of the constituent nodes to run {{close to an}} agreed upon notion of time. Most of the widely used clock synchronization algorithms in such systems employ the sender-receiver protocol based on a two-way timing message exchange paradigm. Max-imum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the clock offset based on the timing message <b>exchanges</b> between two <b>clocks</b> was derived in D. R. Jeske, On maximum likelihood estimation of clock offset[IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 53, pp. 53 – 54, Jan. 2005], when the fixed delays are symmetric and the variable delays in each direction assume an exponential distribution with an unknown mean. Herein, the best linear unbiased estimate using order statistics (BLUE-OS) of the clock offset between two nodes is derived assuming both symmetric and asymmetric exponential network delays, respectively. The Rao-Blackwell-Lehmann-Scheffé the-orem is then exploited to obtain the minimum variance unbiased estimate (MVUE) for the clock offset which it is shown {{to coincide with the}} BLUE-OS. In addition, it is found that the MVUE of the clock offset in the presence of symmetric network delays also coincides with the MLE. Finally, in the presence of asymmetric network delays, although the MLE is biased, it is shown to achieve lesser mean-square error (MSE) than the MVUE in the region around the point where the bidirectional network link delays are symmetric and hence its merit as the most versatile estimator is fairly justified.

40|$|In this paper, a low-cost, {{low-power}} {{and high}} performance micro control unit (MCU) core is proposed for wireless {{body sensor networks}} (WBSNs). It consists of an asynchronous interface, a register bank, a reconfigurable filter, a slop-feature forecast, a lossless data encoder, an error correct coding (ECC) encoder, a UART interface, a power management (PWM), and a multi-sensor controller. To improve the system performance and expansion abilities, the asynchronous interface is added for handling signal <b>exchanges</b> between different <b>clock</b> domains. To eliminate the noise of various bio-signals, the reconfigurable filter is created to provide the functions of average, binomial and sharpen filters. The slop-feature forecast and the lossless data encoder is proposed to reduce the data of various biomedical signals for transmission. Furthermore, the ECC encoder is added to improve the reliability for the wireless transmission and the UART interface is employed the proposed design to be compatible with wireless devices. For long-term healthcare monitoring application, a power management technique is developed for reducing the power consumption of the WBSN system. In addition, the proposed design can be operated with four different bio-sensors simultaneously. The proposed design was successfully tested with a FPGA verification board. The VLSI architecture of this work contains 7. 67 -K gate counts and consumes the power of 5. 8 mW or 1. 9 mW at 100 MHz or 133 MHz processing rate using a TSMC 0. 18 μm or 0. 13 μm CMOS process.

40|$|The delay {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) {{is characterized}} by frequent disconnections and long delays of links among devices due to mobility, sparse deployment of devices, attacks, and noise, etc. Considerable research efforts have been devoted recently to DTNs enabling communications between network entities with intermittent connectivity. Unfortunately, mobile devices have limited energy capacity, and the fundamental problem is that traditional power-saving mechanisms are designed assuming well connected networks. Due to much larger inter-contact durations than contact durations, devices {{spend most of their}} life time in the neighbor discovery, and centralized power-saving strategies are difficult. Consequently, mobile devices consume a significant amount of energy in the neighbor discovery, rather than in infrequent data transfers. Therefore, distributed energy efficient neighbor discovery protocols for DTNs are essential to minimize the degradation of network connectivity and maximize the benefits from mobility. In this thesis, we develop sleep scheduling protocols in the medium access control (MAC) layer that are adaptive and distributed under different clock synchronization conditions: synchronous, asynchronous, and semi-asynchronous. In addition, we propose a distributed clock synchronization protocol to mitigate the clock synchronization problem in DTNs. Our research accomplishments are briefly outlined as follows: Firstly, we design an adaptive exponential beacon (AEB) protocol. By exploiting the trend of contact availability, beacon periods are independently adjusted by each device and optimized using the distribution of contact durations. The AEB protocol significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining comparable packet delivery delay and delivery ratio. Secondly, we design two asynchronous clock based sleep scheduling (ACDS) protocols. Based on the fact that global clock synchronization is difficult to achieve in general, predetermined patterns of sleep schedules are constructed using hierarchical arrangements of cyclic difference sets such that devices independently selecting different duty cycle lengths are still guaranteed to have overlapping awake intervals with other devices within the communication range. Thirdly, we design a distributed semi-asynchronous sleep scheduling (DSA) protocol. Although the synchronization error is unavoidable, some level of clock accuracy may be possible for many practical scenarios. The sleep schedules are constructed to guarantee contacts among devices having loosely synchronized clocks, and parameters are optimized using the distribution of synchronization error. We also define conditions for which the proposed semi-asynchronous protocol outperforms existing asynchronous sleep scheduling protocols. Lastly, we design a distributed clock synchronization (DCS) protocol. The proposed protocol considers asynchronous and long delayed connections when <b>exchanging</b> relative <b>clock</b> information among nodes. As a result, smaller synchronization error achieved by the proposed protocol allows more accurate timing information and renders neighbor discovery more energy efficient. The designed protocols improve the lifetime of mobile devices in DTNs by means of energy efficient neighbor discoveries that reduce the energy waste caused by idle listening problems...|$|R
