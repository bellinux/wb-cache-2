40|$|The {{onset of}} a 'late' {{rotating}} vortex over an off-centre <b>drain</b> <b>nozzle</b> at 2 / 3 radius was studied in an 1160 -mm diameter tank. It {{was found that}} using a sloped bottom ladle could be beneficial in terms of steel yield, provided the exit nozzle is located 'centrically'. Miner modification of the nozzle (skewed nozzle) to impart a radial component of velocity to the spinning vortex core {{was found to be}} effective in making AMEPA system sensitive to early slag entrainment phenomena by diverting the core away from the central vertical axis of the nozzle. A 0. 75 scale water model was constructed to simulate the flow of liquid steel through a ladle shroud in the presence of gas infiltration. It was found that the ladle shroud slag detector could be temporarily 'blinded' by gas bubbles or permanently blinded by a standing submerged gas jet...|$|E
40|$|Dear Sir or Madam: By the {{reference}} letter dated April 21, 2008, the NRC approved the request by Entergy Operations, Inc,(Entergy) for inservice inspection (ISI) {{program to the}} requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section Xl. The requested relief was for the installation of preemptive full structural weld overlays on dissimilar metal welds of one pressurizer surge nozzle, one pressurizer spray nozzle, three pressurizer safety/relief valve nozzles, one hot leg surge nozzle, two hot leg shutdown cooling nozzles and one hot leg <b>drain</b> <b>nozzle.</b> As part of the request, Entergy committed to submit the following information to the NRC within 14 days following completion of final Ultrasonic (UT) examinations of the weld overlays: (a) Weld overlay examination results, including a listing of indications detected, (b) Disposition of all indications using the standards of ASME Section Xl, IWB- 3514 - 2 and/or IWB- 3514 - 3 criteria and, if possible, the type and nature of the indications, and (c) A discussion of any repairs to the weld overlay material and/or base metal and the reason for the repairs. W 3 F 1 - 2008 - 0040 Page 2 This information is provided in the attachment to this letter. The final UT examination of the weld overlays was completed on May 16, 2008. There are no new commitments contained in this submittal. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Robert Murillo a...|$|E
40|$|Fairly recently, a new {{experimental}} {{free surface}} liquid metal MHD facility, the so-called MTOR facility, has come on-line, and new data {{has been taken}} concerning flows of gallium alloy across a moderately strong toroidal field with characteristic 1 /R field gradient. The purpose of these experiments has been two-fold: to gather data for benchmarking currently existing one and two dimensional free surface computational flow models (as well as 3 D models currently under development), and to investigate phenomena not predicted by models, especially effects of <b>nozzles,</b> <b>drains,</b> waves and turbulence. Data is presented concerning MHD effects on the mean flow height and wave structure, both with and without the so-called Zakharov magnetic propulsion current added to help control and stabilize the flow. The test section is wide enough so that the characteristic factor (Hartmann Number * Aspect Ratio) is less than unity. In this case the Hartmann layer drag effects are small, allowing comparison of experimental data to two-dimensional axisymmetric models. Preliminary conclusions suggest that the field gradient in these experiments does not adversely affect {{the stability of the}} surface, and that magnetic propulsion current is effective in flattening and accelerating the liquid metal flow...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A stopper rod runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to <b>drain</b> through the <b>nozzle.</b> Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|R
