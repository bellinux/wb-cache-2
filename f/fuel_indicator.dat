The {{accident}} resulted from engine fuel starvation that resulted from the installation of the wrong <b>fuel</b> quantity <b>indicator.</b> The <b>fuel</b> quantity <b>indicator</b> installed had been calibrated for the smaller ATR-42 aircraft and showed significantly more fuel than was actually in the tank of the larger ATR 72.

Both engines stopped and the crew was forced to ditch the airliner in the sea.|$|R

The {{aircraft}} was carrying 39 passengers and crew, 16 of whom died. Officials at Bari airport reported {{that most of the}} passengers were Italian tourists. The <b>fuel</b> <b>indicator</b> was reading incorrectly because it was designed to be fitted only in a smaller plane: the ATR42. Therefore, the crew did not detect that the aircraft was running low on fuel. The turboprop suffered fuel exhaustion and the ATR72 ditched off the Sicilian coast. The airline was banned from flying into Italy for almost two years.|$|E
50|$|The last {{incarnation}} of the Fiat 500 was the R model. It had the same 594 cc engine of the Fiat 126, however, the power rating {{is the same as}} the L but at lower rpm (4000 instead of 4400) and with a bit more torque; a full synchromesh gearbox is still missing. The floor-pan which was from either the 'L', or later, the new 126. It was also more comfortable, but more simply trimmed and equipped than before — the fuel gauge was omitted and only the low <b>fuel</b> <b>indicator</b> remained. The 500 R was also a stop-gap for Fiat prior to the launch of the Fiat 126, and when the new 126 was launched, sales of the old Fiat 500 R plummeted. It was sold alongside the Fiat 126 for another two years before Fiat retired the 500.|$|E
50|$|Both the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 {{feature the}} new unit {{construction}} engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively.

Also the Classic 350 has an ammeter while the Classic 500 {{has a low}} <b>fuel</b> <b>indicator</b> light and engine check light instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on the Classic 350 {{is more of a}} vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the top dead centre (CB Points closed) then the ammeter would stay in the middle. This feature allowed the rider to use the decompresson lever to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500.|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} and {{hazard level}} {{associated with the}} use of hypergolic fuels necessitates the development of technology capable of detecting the presence of such fuels in a variety of different environments and conditions. The most commonly used sensors for the detection of hypergolic fuels are electrochemical in nature, which have serious limitations when used as area monitoring devices. Recent collaborative work between Kennedy Space Center and ASRC Aerospace has led to the development of indicators which exhibit a color change upon exposure to hydrazine under different conditions. The indicators under investigation on this developmental effort are para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB), various formulations of universal pH indicators, and potassium tetrachloroaurate (KAuCl 4). These chemochromic indicators have been tested for the detection of hydrazine under various conditions: pure liquid fuel, aqueous fuel solution, saline aqueous fuel solutions, vapor fuel, and 3 -month shelf life study, which included UV protection, thermal extremes, and normal storage conditions. The hypergolic <b>fuel</b> <b>indicator</b> test was conducted with the indicator impregnated into a wipe material to test the applicability of the indicator to be used to capture (absorb) and indicate the presence of hypergolic fuels. Each of the indicators performed well, with the universal pH indicator being the best candidate because of the visible response color change and the indicator stability after the shelf life study...|$|E
