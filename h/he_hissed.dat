500|$|In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov {{conducted}} {{a pair of}} concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky-Korsakov's in particular. The following year, his opera Sadko was produced at the Paris Opéra and The Snow Maiden at the Opéra-Comique. He also {{had the opportunity to}} hear more recent music by European composers. <b>He</b> <b>hissed</b> unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss's opera Salome, and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande, [...] "Don't make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them!" [...] Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music. He admitted that he was a [...] "convinced kuchkist" [...] (after kuchka, the shortened Russian term for The Five) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind.|$|E

6000|$|Baxter put up his fists, {{but on the}} {{approach}} of Dick and Sam he promptly retreated. But before he went <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> in Tom's ear: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sacrè Bleu!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hisses</b> {{between his}} new {{celluloid}} teeth. [...] "It is Tictocq, the detective. I wonder {{whom he is}} following now?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Orion - A ginger cat {{belonging}} to Nick and Rachel. Rhiannon and Small Sam {{think he is}} ugly. When {{some of the kids}} try to escape, they run into Orion, and <b>he</b> <b>hisses</b> in surprise, alerting Nick and Rachel to the escape.|$|R
50|$|The Rattler: A green, decidedly creepy snake-man with {{a passion}} for the arts. <b>He</b> <b>hisses</b> and slithers, and can {{communicate}} with and control plant life. The Rattler is also known to wield shotguns and bombs. His name is a take off on The Riddler, though his m.o. is more like Poison Ivy. He is voiced by Chuck McCann.|$|R
6000|$|... "Legget, you needn't try to {{hide your}} trail," [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed,</b> and {{it seemed as if}} there was a bitter, {{reckless}} pleasure in these words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you be silent!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> {{through his}} teeth, his face deadly pale {{now with a}} passion of wrath at least as fierce as hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall yet be mine!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> in Winnifred's ear, and, {{releasing}} his grasp, {{he rushed}} with a bound past the rescuer into the street.|$|E
6000|$|Thers. This Diomede's a false-hearted rogue, {{an unjust}} knave; I will no more trust {{him when he}} winks with one eye, than I will a serpent when <b>he</b> <b>hisses.</b> <b>He</b> will spend his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound; but when he performs, astronomers set it down for a prodigy: though I long to see Hector, I cannot forbear dogging him. They say he keeps a Trojan drab; and uses Calchas's tent, that {{fugitive}} priest of Troy, that canonical rogue of our side. I'll after him; nothing but whoring in this age; all incontinent rascals! [...] [Exit THERSITES.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll rue this, both of you! Mark my words!" [...] <b>he</b> fairly <b>hissed,</b> and {{the next}} moment he had {{disappeared}} {{into the darkness of}} the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't make {{a bit of}} noise, or you'll {{be sorry}} for it," [...] <b>he</b> fairly <b>hissed,</b> and his manner was so hateful that Dora was {{thoroughly}} cowed.|$|R
6000|$|The marquis gave three short sharp raps on {{the ground}} with his stick. [...] "I demand of you to step out of our path!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ach So!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> with an {{animosity}} {{that made}} my assumed gravity change into the most genuine concern. What meant this tone? And I hurried on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You cad!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> out, {{his voice}} shaking with fury. [...] "How dare you attempt to pry into my private affairs? Give me the envelope, or I'll----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Our host rushed at {{his sister}} and grabbed the white wrist that escaped from the loose sleeve of her dress. [...] "What was in that note?" [...] <b>he</b> quite <b>hissed</b> at her.|$|R
6000|$|As for the rest, {{each winter}} up they run, And all are clear, and {{something}} must be done. [...] 30 Then urged by C---t,[100] or by C---t stopp'd, Inflamed by P----,[101] and by P---- dropp'd; They follow reverently each wondrous wight, Amazed that one can read, that one can write: So geese to gander prone obedience keep, <b>Hiss,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>hiss,</b> and if <b>he</b> slumber, sleep. Till having done whate'er was fit or fine, Utter'd a speech, and ask'd their friends to dine; Each hurries back to his paternal ground, Content but for five shillings in the pound, [...] 40 Yearly defeated, yearly hopes they give, And all agree Sir Robert cannot live.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, Carol Channing had {{appeared}} on Sesame Street and sang {{a parody of}} the song called [...] "Hello, Sammy!", a love song being sung by Carol to a character known as Sammy the Snake (as voiced by Jim Henson). Carol, in this parody segment, serenades Sammy telling him just how much she loves and adores him while Sammy coils himself around Carol's arms. They are soon joined by 4 giant swaying letter S's wearing top hats. Carol ends the song by telling Sammy just how much she'd miss him and the way <b>he</b> <b>hisses</b> if they ever parted. Carol's song includes lyrics such as: [...] "So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I'll stake a claim on you".|$|R
6000|$|The mask had fairly {{dropped from}} Girdlestone. No gaunt old wolf could have glared down with fiercer eyes {{or a more}} cruel mouth. [...] "You fool!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you, white man?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed.</b> [...] "That {{you are no}} Barsoomian {{from the}} outer world is evident from your colour. And you are not of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, discovered! Hush! listen, girl!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed,</b> in {{a fierce}} whisper; [...] "utter a {{syllable}} to frustrate my plans, and you die; aid me, and"-- But he was gone.|$|E
60|$|The breath {{came through}} Barnes' teeth {{with a little}} <b>hiss.</b> <b>He</b> {{realized}} his position almost at once. He was trapped.|$|R
50|$|The Attorney General of Israel dropped {{criminal}} charges against <b>Hiss.</b> <b>He</b> was fired in 2012 and replaced by Dr. Hen Kugel.|$|R
6000|$|Urgent voices {{cried out}} {{together}} alongside. Massy {{did not seem}} able to tear himself away from the bridge. <b>He</b> chattered and <b>hissed</b> despairingly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White boy {{keep quiet}} or Yellow Elk {{come in and}} kill!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed,</b> in a low but {{distinct}} tone. [...] "No make a sound till Indian open door again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dog!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed,</b> {{and struck}} {{the master of}} fence a {{stinging}} blow across the face, and spat upon him. Then he turned on his heel and strode from the armory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, discovered! Hush! listen, girl!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed,</b> in a fiercer whisper, [...] "utter a {{syllable}} {{to frustrate}} my plans and you die; aid me, and--" [...] But he was gone.|$|E
50|$|Licurius, an evil-tempered leer, Miss Europe's factotum (servant). He has {{a speech}} {{impairment}} {{and as a}} result constantly <b>hisses.</b> <b>He</b> thinks Rossamund smells funny.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help you. Mother of Mercies! I {{dare not}} help you!" [...] <b>hissed</b> <b>he.</b> [...] "She-devil! you have begun it, {{and you must}} finish it yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She sent me. I did {{not come}} of my own accord. I came under orders." [...] <b>He</b> spoke sternly, <b>hissing</b> out his gutturals in an angry voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Gall—I smell sulphur! Beardsall, old boy, there's {{fun in the}} wind. Madie, and the coy little Tempest, and——" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> a line of a music-hall song {{through his}} teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Richard Wharton!' <b>he</b> <b>hissed</b> {{out between}} his teeth, {{springing}} away like one stung. 'Richard Wharton come back! You liar! You sneak! He's dead this twenty years! You're trying to frighten me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you know}} about its contents?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hissed.</b> [...] "Why do you suppose it would not suit my purpose to have it {{fall into the hands of}} the English police?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Of note is {{the account}} of her {{acquaintance}} with Alger Hiss ("a charming and attractive fellow") and of her version of the breakdown of his marriage with Priscilla Hiss. During the 1930s in Washington, DC, Durr knew the Hisses through Marnie and Henry Abbott, the latter descended from the family of US President John Adams. Some years later, she saw Priscilla Hiss at the wedding of the oldest child of Clark Foreman (founder of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and a Wallace aide during the 1948 elections). Aside from aging past point of recognition, Mrs. Hiss (according to Durr), was [...] "terribly bitter" [...] about her separation from Alger Hiss: [...] <b>He</b> <b>Hiss</b> became a symbolic hero, particularly {{to a lot of}} rich women here in New York. And they just took him away from me. They surrounded him and made him a hero and became worshippers, formed a cult almost." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the fallout of the {{prosecution}} case against the clergy of the Chapel was serious. Wilkinson was sentenced in 1756 to 14 years transportation. He died the following year en route to British North America. The curate John Grierson, who had carried out the marriage, received the same sentence: Vernon had testified at the trial, and consequentially hissed off the stage. <b>He</b> was <b>hissed</b> off in the October and when he appeared again in the following January <b>he</b> was <b>hissed</b> off the stage again. The unpopular Vernon moved to Dublin, where he had further success as an actor. She used the name of Vernon, but in 1762 her [...] "husband" [...] returned and Poitier returned to using her former name. She caused scandal that year when she shocked the royal family in their Covent Garden box with a very low cut gown. She balanced this by tying a shoe on stage and the stalls noticed that she not wearing underwear.|$|R
5000|$|... [...] "Give {{him what}} <b>he</b> wants," [...] <b>hissed</b> the innkeeper's wife into his ear. [...] "He's clearly insane. I don't {{know what his}} father did, {{but it must be}} {{something}} terrible!" ...|$|R
