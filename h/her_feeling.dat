5|$|The Scranton and Stamford {{branches}} {{prepare for}} the upcoming merger. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) professes excitement over the merger, mostly because of the return of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). She soon learns throughout the day that Jim has become slightly distant at her {{and that he has}} formed a close relationship with Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), visibly shaking <b>her.</b> <b>Feeling</b> bad with their awkward reunion, Jim catches up to Pam {{at the end of the}} day and informs her that he's seeing someone.

5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left <b>her</b> <b>feeling</b> bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and <b>her</b> <b>feeling</b> of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left <b>her</b> <b>feeling</b> shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
25|$|Another {{close friend}} was George Eliot, whom Georgiana met in February 1868. The self-educated novelist {{encouraged}} her young friend {{to make up}} for her lack of education, and Georgiana studied to improve her scant French and German, and took Latin lessons.

25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though <b>her</b> <b>feeling</b> for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E

50|$|As a {{young child}} Swentzell began to {{experiment}} with clay, creating tiny figures to convey <b>her</b> <b>feelings.</b> Roxanne found it exceedingly difficult to communicate through speech because of a speech impediment. The desperate need to express <b>her</b> <b>feelings</b> provoked <b>her</b> to collect scraps of clay from her mother, a potter, to create figures to illustrate <b>her</b> <b>feelings.</b> When she was in first grade, Swentzell molded a small clay school desk with sad, weeping little girl slouched in it. The sculpture was meant to explain her unhappiness at school to her mother. Sculpting became Swentzell’s primary means of communication: an emotional outlet and safe haven to express <b>her</b> <b>feelings.</b> Swentzell’s teachers were amazed by her clay figures and took {{a special interest in}} developing her talents as a young sculptor.|$|R

500|$|Although a {{male voice}} actor was sought for the Japanese {{adaptation}} of the Naruto role, the actress Junko Takeuchi was chosen instead over many male applicants.

Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with <b>her</b> <b>feeling</b> he was [...] "a very reliable young man". She admired his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.|$|E
