40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the elastic {{behavior of a}} very long crosslinked polyelectrolyte chain (Debye-Hückel chain), which is weakly charged. Therefore {{the response of the}} crosslinked chain (network) on an external constant force f acting on the ends of the chain is considered. A selfconsistent variational computation of an effective field theory is employed. It is shown, that the modulus of the polyelectrolyte network has two parts: the first term represents the usual <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> of connected flexible chains and the second term takes into account the electrostatic interaction of the monomers. It is proportional to the squared crosslink density and the Debye - screening parameter. Comment: submitted for publication to PR...|$|E

The {{thermodynamic}} parameters (change in {{free energy}} of elasticity, ∆Ge; change in enthalpy of elasticity, ∆He; {{and change in}} <b>entropy</b> of <b>elasticity,</b> ∆Se) and the electrical conductivity of natural rubber composites reinforced separately with some agricultural wastes have been determined. Results show that the reinforced composites are relatively more ordered and more spontaneous to elasticity than the unreinforced composite.

Both the &# 8220;entropic&# 8221; and &# 8220;energetic&# 8221; motions of polymer chains that contribute in macroscopic elastic deformation {{are taken into}} account. The model displays a continuous transition from <b>entropy</b> to energetic <b>elasticity,</b> without common singularity caused by finite extensibility of polymer chains. A multi-scale molecular approach, based on recent literature concepts has been employed for evaluations of continuum parameters.

40|$|The "two-way" {{shape memory}} {{response}} of semicrystalline networks was studied on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) -based systems, crosslinked by thermal curing of methacrylic end-capped linear chains. By changing the methacrylation degree of the precursors, {{it was possible}} to vary the network density over one order of magnitude, without any remarkable change in their transition temperatures and crystallinity content. When subjected to a constant stress and to a cooling-heating cycle from above T-m to below T-c, the materials display reversible two-way shape memory capabilities, consisting in a cyclic elongation-contraction effect, which involves significant variations of strain. Two different cooling induced elongational processes are evidenced, one due to <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> and the other to a crystallization driven effect. The amount of elongation that may be achieved depends on the network density and on the applied stress, and it is maximized for systems with a crosslink density that allows to exploit both the entropy-and the crystallization-induced effect...|$|E
30|$|NaOH {{treatment}} is well-known as mercerization {{that is the}} pretreatment of cellulose, by which the cellulose crystalline structure translates from cellulose I to cellulose II in the specified concentration region. Decrystallization and swelling perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cellulose chains are important factors in the mercerization process, and have thus been noted and discussed for NaOH treatment. However, structural changes along the longitudinal axis of the microfibrils of a decrystallized region have been little noted with a few reports [1 – 4]. Nakano et al. [5 – 7] have reported that dimensions of wood sample induced with NaOH treatment change anisotropically, which {{is related to the}} longitudinal structural changes in the microfibrils embedded in the matrix of the wood cell wall. Ramie fibers also show significant contraction {{along the length of the}} material [8]. Changes in such shapes are due to the construction of the microfibrils, that is, the <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> force resulting from the temperature dependence [5, 8, 9].|$|E
40|$|A type {{of quick}} water-responsive shape memory hybrids is {{fabricated}} by introducing cellulose nanofibrous mats as the filler in a polymeric matrix. Cellulose nanofibrous mats are obtained through hydrolyzing electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) nanofibers, then casted in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) solution {{to form the}} hybrids. The quick shape memory behavior of the formed hybrids is demonstrated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and stress–strain cyclic test. According to a predetermined protocol, the hybrids present desirable shape fixation and recovery, and the elastic modulus (E′) is shown to be responsive promptly and reversibly against drying and wetting cycle. Shape memory mechanism of the hybrids involves the reversible and competitive hydrogen bonds within cellulose before and after water immersion {{as well as the}} <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> of the TPU matrix.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis for the}} elasticity of the human erythrocyte membrane was explored. Skeletons were released from ghosts in Triton X- 100 and their dimensions followed by dark-field microscopy and packed volume. The rest size of skeletons was assumed to reflect the balance point between expansion (deformation) driven by electrostatic repulsions among the excess of fixed negative charges on the proteins and contraction (recovery) driven by their elasticity. The size of skeletons decreased with increasing temperature. This finding suggests that <b>entropy</b> drives <b>elasticity.</b> The requisite <b>entropy</b> change could be associated with either the configurational freedom of flexible protein chains or with the solvation of side chains exposed during protein dissociation (hydrophobic effects). To distinguish between these two alternatives, we tested the impact of two weak denaturants, 10 % ethanol and 20 nM lithium 3, 5 -diiodosalicylate. Both agents reversibly promoted the expansion of skeletons, presumably by reducing their elasticity. Since the conformation of random coils and globular proteins should not be significantly altered by these mild treatments, this finding strongly suggests a role for weak interdomain and/or interprotein associations. We conclude that the elasticity of the red cell membrane skeleton may not derive from the configurational entropy of flexible coils. Rather, the elastic energy may arise from reversible dissociations of weak but specific intramolecular and/or intermolecular contacts, presumably within deformed spectrin filaments...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a summary of}} {{an example of how}} relationships between molecular scale properties and macroscopic properties are formulated, in this case with a focus on fibril microstructures and according system <b>elasticity.</b> <b>Entropy</b> plays a dominant role on all length scales. The elasticity is reviewed in terms of the micro-mechanical properties of the fibrils over a wide range of concentrations. The elasticity is concluded to be of an entropic nature. The micro-mechanical fibril property is the persistence length. For fibrils based on globular proteins the response to temperature change and flow has been reported to be either reversible or non-reversible, dependent on the age of the fibril. The reversibility is argued {{to be related to the}} fact that the fibril consists of peptides originating from hydrolysis of the globular proteins, and that the initial step of fibrillar peptide assembly is entropic of nature. The longer term irreversibility is speculated to be caused by a secondary assembly step being a collective transition into inter-beta-sheet...|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of non-isothermal flow of viscoelastic materials using differential constitutive equations is investigated. The {{approach is}} based on the concept of a slip tensor describing the nonaffine motion of the stress-carrying structure of the fluid. By specifying a slip tensor and the elastic behaviour of the structure, the constitutive model is determined. This slip tensor also appears in the energy equation and thus, for a given constitutive model, the form of the energy equation is known. Besides the partitioning between dissipated and elastically stored energy, also the difference between <b>entropy</b> and energy <b>elasticity</b> is discussed. Numerical simulations are based on a stabilized Discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the mass, momentum and constitutive equations and a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation to solve the energy equation.

Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) sapwood was used to produce the samples of compressive wood.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{phenomenon}} in which the reversible formation and disruption of a cellulose nano-whisker (CNW) percolation network in an elastomeric thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix leads to an unprecedentedly rapidly switchable shape-memory effect (SME) that may be activated by water. The materials have been fully characterized to investigate the SME phenomenon using {{a number of different}} experimental techniques including cyclic tensile deformation, dynamic mechanical analysis, FTIR and polarized Raman spectroscopy. A model is developed in which it is shown that exposure to water allows breakup of the CNW percolation network so that the flexible elastomer matrix can be deformed to the desired shape. The CNW percolation network reforms after drying to provide a fixing force for the temporary shape. The <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> of the TPU matrix then enables rapid shape recovery when the CNW percolation network is disrupted again during wetting. This completely athermal water-sensitive SME mechanism is totally different from traditional ones, in which the water or other solvents are used as plasticizers to lower the glass transition temperature of shape memory polymers, so as to allow triggering of the shape recovery at room temperature or lower. The reported work provides a novel and effective strategy to achieve rapidly switchable shape recovery in a material by a simple wetting process and fixing through an easily applicable programmed drying process.

When exposed to humid environments, epoxy resins can absorb water up to a 10 weight -%, depending on the chemical nature and structure, stress state, exposure time, water concentration and temperature. The use of temperature and time dependent material parameters is state-of-the-art in microelectronic packaging. This paper presents various modified measurement methods for analysis of the effect of moisture of thermo-mechanical properties of MEMS-relevant polymer systems. In the Micro Materials Center's lab, an advanced measurement method was developed - which modified DMA multi frequency and hygroscopic swell analysis for the determination of moisture-dependent parameters for micro and nano scale samples. The time-moisture superposition principle has been introduced for some polymers where a humidity shift factor is used along the frequency axis at constant temperature. The relationship between the humidity shift factor and the equilibrium water content is analogically described by the WLF (Williams-Landel-Ferry) -type equation on the time-temperature-superposition.

The aim of the work was to study the direct interactions of spectrin, the cytoskeleton of RBCs, with membrane lipid to determine its effects on the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer. Motivation for this work came {{from a lack of}} unanimity in the field of spectrin, and the hypothesized potential of the protein to perforate giant unilamellar vesicles. The work aimed to investigate and determine how spectrin-lipid interactions influence membrane mesoscopic morphology and biophysics in ways that could ultimately be important to cellular function. For this purpose, a protocol was implemented {{to take into account the}} different aspects of the binding. Direct visualisation of the spectrin-lipid interaction and distribution was achieved using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Changes in the mechanical properties of the membrane were investigated using the micropipette aspiration technique. Finally the thermodynamics of the interaction were considered with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. This allowed evaluation of the protein-lipid interaction in a complete and coherent manner. Experiments were also performed on another elastic protein, alpha-elastin, for comparison.

HTPB R 45 HT based binders with four different types of isocyanates (IPDI, HDI, DE 305 and 6 HMDI), with and without the common plasticizer DOA (dioctyl adipate), were analyzed using loss factor curves obtained by torsion DMA. Exponentially modified Gauss distribution functions (EMG) were used to model {{the effect of the}} isocyanates on the molecular mobility (MM) of the polymeric networks. Developments of loss factor curves as a function of temperature showed distinct differences in the intensity of loss factor curves with different isocyanates in the following order HDI > IPDI >> 6 HMDI > DE 305. A relationship between MM observed by loss factor curves with tensile test was developed to support the effect of the isocyanates on the binder network. Additional series of HTPB R 45 HT+IPDI binders were formulated with four different plasticizers (DOA, DOS, DOZ and IDP) to make further analysis of the effect of plasticizer types. Loss factor curves with different plasticizers had showed not such pronounced differences compared with the differences obtained with the isocyanate types. Mainly, the four plasticizers showed the same level of intensity in loss factor curves and maximum peak temperature Tg, except IDP, which provided with the lowest glass-rubber transition temperature.

40|$|Chapter 1 briefly {{introduces}} the theoretical background of how applications and lists some of resent research progresses in this area. Polymer with various configurations and conformations pass through nanopores; including polymer linear chains, stars polymer, branched polymers, polymer micelles are introduced. Among them, the de Gennes and Brochard-Wyart's predictions of polymer linear and star chains passing through nanopores are emphasized, {{in which they}} predicted that qc of linear chain is qc ≃ kBT/(3 pieta), where kB, T and eta are the Boltzmann constant, the absolutely temperature, and the viscosity of solvent, respectively, independent of both the chain length and the pore size; and for star chains passing through nanopores, there exist a optimal entering arm numbers, namely, the star chains passing through nanopores. Chapter 2 details basic theory of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS), including its instrumentation and our ultrafiltration setup. Chapter 3 briefly {{introduces the}} sample preparation, including the history and mechanism of anionic living polymerization, {{as well as how}} we used a novel home-made set-up to prepare linear polystyrene with different chain lengths and star polystyrene with various arm numbers and lengths. Chapter 4 summarizes our measured critical flow rates (qc) of linear polymer chains with different lengths for nanopores with different sizes, since the flow rate {{is directly related to the}} hydrodynamic force, we have developed a sensitive method (down to tens fN) to directly assess how much the hydrodynamic force (Fh) is required to overcome the weak <b>entropy</b> <b>elasticity</b> and stretch individual coiled chains in solution. Our method is completely different from the using existing optical tweezers or AFM, because they measure the relatively stronger enthalpy elasticity. Our results confirm that qc is indeed independent of the chain length, but decreases as the pore size increases. The value of qc is ∼ 10 [...] 200 times smaller than kBT/(3 pieta). Such a discrepancy has been attributed to the rough assumption made by de Gennes and his coworkers; namely, each chain segment "blob" confined inside the pore is not a hard sphere so that the effective length along the flow direction is much longer than the pore diameter. Finally, using the solution temperature, we varied the chain conformation, our result shows that q c has a minimum which is near, but not exactly located at the theta temperature, might leading to a better way to determine the true ideal state of a polymer solution, at which all viral coefficients, not only the second vanish. Chapter 5 uses polymer solutions made of different mixtures of linear and star chains, we have demonstrated that flushing these solution mixtures through a nanopore with a properly chosen flow rate can effectively and cleanly separate linear and star chains no matter whether linear chains are larger or smaller than star chains. Chapter 6 further investigates how star-like polystyrene pass through a given nanopore under the flow field. Star polystyrene chains with different arm lengths (LA) and numbers (f) passing through a nanopore (20 nm) under an elongational flow field was investigated in terms of the flow-rate dependent relative retention ((C 0 - C) /C 0), where C 0 and C are the polymer concentrations before and after the ultrafiltration. Our results reveal that for a given arm length (LA), the critical flow rate (qc,star), below which star chains are blocked, dramatically increases with the total arm numbers (f); but for a given f, is nearly independent on LA, contradictory to the previous prediction made by de Gennes and Brochard-Wyart. We have revised their theory in the region fin < fout and also accounted for the effective length of each blob, where fin and fout are the numbers of arms inside and outside the pore, respectively. In the revision, we show that qc,star is indeed independent of LA but related to f and f in in two different ways, depending on whether fin ≤ f/ 2 or ≥ f/ 2. A comparison of our experimental and calculated results reveals that most of star chains pass through the nanopores with fin ∼ f/ 2. Further study of the temperature dependent (C 0 - C) /C 0 of polystyrene in cyclohexane reveals that there exists a minimum of qc,star at ∼ 38 °C, close to its theta temperature (- 34. 5 °C). This Ph. D. thesis presents our study on the ultrafiltration of polymers with different configurations and conformations; namly, theoretically, the passing of polymer chains through a nanopore under an elongational flow filed has been studied for years, but experimental studies are rare because of two following reasons: (1) lacks a precise method to investigate how individual single polymer chain pass through a nanopore; (2) it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a set of polymer samples with a narrow molar mass distribution and a uniform structures; except for linear chains. The central question in this study is to find the critical (minimum) flow rate (qc) for each kind of chains, at which the chains can pass through a given nanopore. A comparison of the measured and calculated qc leads to a better understanding how different chains are deformed, stretched and pulled through a nanopore. We have developed a novel method of combinating static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS) to precisely measure the relative retention concentration ((C 0 - C) /C 0). Ge, Hui. Adviser: Chi Wu.
