50|$|South Devons {{were one}} of the few British breeds to have been {{selected}} for draught purposes as well as for beef and milk. The first <b>importations</b> into Australia were of milking cows carried on sailing ships. Several large <b>importations</b> occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but the breed then lost its identity through crossbreeding. <b>Importations</b> from Britain took place in 1969, and the first purebred animals were imported from New Zealand in 1971.

5|$|About 900years ago, {{attempts}} were made to introduce eastern blood into the Icelandic, resulting in a degeneration of the stock.

40|$|Background: Given the {{interconnectivity}} of Brazil {{with the}} rest of the world, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have the potential to spread rapidly around the world via viremic travellers. The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number of <b>importations</b> of ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. Design: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on <b>importations</b> of dengue to estimate the number of ZIKV <b>importations</b> into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. Results: Our model estimated between 508 and 1, 778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number of <b>importations</b> being into France, Portugal and Italy. Conclusions: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent of <b>importations</b> in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain–Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome...|$|R

5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 {{black people}} in Texas, taking {{advantage}} of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the <b>importation</b> of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the <b>importation</b> to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the <b>importation</b> of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundMeasles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} vaccine-preventable disease {{that can lead to}} serious complications. Although measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur each year as a result of <b>importations</b> of the disease from countries in which it remains endemic.

MethodsMeasles is nationally notifiable in the USA and local and state health departments report confirmed measles cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
