We were kind of told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that the voice was too mature. I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{contains}} a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with [...] "karaoke renditions" [...] of whale calls. Gish later noted that [...] " [...] gave me a tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer." [...] Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, [...] "I just thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of much like [...] character to appreciate that." ...|$|E
500|$|Hair {{challenged}} many of {{the norms}} held by Western society in 1968. [...] The name itself, inspired {{by the name of}} a Jim Dine painting depicting a comb and a few strands of hair, was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism. [...] Rado remembers that long hair [...] "was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was. Long hair was shocking, and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a flag, really." ...|$|E

500|$|The opening {{match between}} Owen Hart and Bret Hart has also {{garnered}} acclaim. McNew {{described as the}} [...] "best opening match in professional wrestling history". It was also #4 {{on the list of}} IGN's Top 20 Matches in Wrestlemania History; writer Jon Robinson described it as [...] "the best opening match in pay-per-view history." [...] Multi-time world champion Chris Jericho stated: [...] "For me, the best match on [...] was always Bret vs. Owen, and it kicked off the show {{and it was hard to}} follow...the story was amazing, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of Owen's coronation – it was a great moment".|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of like very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir-y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on".|$|E
500|$|... "So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E

500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game). It was pretty cool. Watching [...] John Wangler go back was pretty cool. For a split-second as they're going back, I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, I pray to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something on the big screen pass.' But it was a good block, and it was a fun moment. Any time I hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{subsequent}} years, {{band members}} have expressed {{dissatisfaction with the}} way the album's mixing turned out. In 2001, Ament said, [...] "I'd love to remix Ten. Ed, for sure, would agree with me...It wouldn't be like changing performances; just pull some of the reverb off it." [...] In 2002, Gossard said, [...] "It was 'over-rocked', we were novices in the studio and spent too long recording, doing different takes, and killing the vibe and overdubbing tons of guitar. There's a lot of reverb on the record." [...] In 2006, Vedder said, [...] "I can listen to the early records [...] the first record...it's just the sound of the record. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of mixed in a way that was...it was kind of produced." ...|$|E

500|$|Disney {{decided to}} release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the film would be [...] "too dark and scary for kids", Selick remembered. [...] "Their biggest fear, and why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a stepchild project, [...] {{they were afraid of}} their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
500|$|The {{farm and}} lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively, {{though it is}} {{depicted}} in Greenwood Lake, New York. [...] "We shot part {{of it at the}} lake where it was 37° cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool," [...] Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. [...] "My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of cool to face my fear and all that," [...] Cook divulged. [...] "We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," [...] Landes enunciated.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different.

This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E

500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, you know, he had a valid point. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played. It’s like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Jake Nava, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "Beautiful Liar". The dance sequences in the video were choreographed by Nadine [...] "Hi-Hat" [...] Ruffin, and are said to incorporate ballet, popping and locking, tribal dance and moves {{similar to the ones}} in the eighties drama Flashdance. Talking about her dancing in the video, Shakira said, [...] "I start doing all kinds of outrageous stuff and hanging upside down and doing stuff that wasn't planned. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of an improvisation. I just got caught in the moment." [...] The music video premiered on 30 July 2009, on MTV and was made available for download on iTunes a day later on 31 July. The video for the Spanish-language translation [...] "Loba" [...] was released on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of a cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When you walked through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the {{religious}} connotations of the album's second track, [...] "Jesus Fever", Vile stated, [...] "My family was religious - I am not particularly practicing religion myself but I was definitely exposed to <b>it.</b> They <b>were</b> super-religious {{but not like}} over-the-top to the point it turns negative. But, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>kind</b> of a gospel thing - back to old music. The Rolling Stones and Spacemen 3 tap into that religious thing really well, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> of a blues-gospel thing. So, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a combination of coming from a religious family and that musical lineage." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Early Winter" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Rice-Oxley, pianist of English {{alternative}} rock band Keane, and Gwen Stefani for the latter's second solo studio album The Sweet Escape (2006). The production of the song was handled by Nellee Hooper. Before working with Oxley in the studio, Stefani called him to discuss some of her ideas behind a potential song, saying [...] "I wanted a ballad. I wanted to write 'Eyes Without a Face' or 'Killing Me Softly' or 'Time After Time,' and he was like, 'OK, Cyndi Lauper, got it,' like he was taking my order." [...] In the studio, Oxley played [...] "Early Winter" [...] on a piano, and after hearing the song, Stefani approved of it and commented that [...] "It was so beautiful and addictive. I didn't really attack it because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of done, lyrics and everything." [...] After letting the song [...] "sit with her for a bit", she rewrote some of the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Dave Lombardo, on {{the other}} hand, asserts the album was professionally done {{compared}} to Show No Mercy: [...] "I didn't have to overdub the cymbals, {{and we had a}} really good engineer." [...] Lombardo's favorite song is [...] "At Dawn They Sleep", [...] "because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of slow and grungy, but then it had that double-bass part at the end." [...] While recording the track, neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics were in the studio—only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it's not a real word. The song [...] "Hardening of the Arteries" [...] on the album ends with the a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song [...] "Hell Awaits" [...] and {{is also one of the}} only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff.|$|E
500|$|On October 24, {{the band}} {{mentioned}} {{that they had}} nearly finishing recording the album and would start the mixing process shortly afterwards. On November 6, the band announced they were [...] "still putting the finshing [...] touches on the album". The recordings were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge with Fernio Hernandez at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne [...] "a good producer," [...] but didn't think he was [...] "the right fit" [...] for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was [...] "just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and {{with all of that}} stuff". Reyes said he was [...] "pre-warned about working with him and I didn't listen to that. ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> of very blank.
