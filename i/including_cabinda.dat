5|$|After the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, <b>including</b> <b>Cabinda</b> and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E

40|$|This project {{offers a}} {{critical}} historical {{analysis of the}} all but forgotten eighteenth-century lifeworlds of the enslaved West Africans, who were brought largely from the ports of Senegambia as well as, to a lesser extent, Ouidah (in present-day Benin) and Cabinda (in today’s Angola) to colonial Louisiana. I argue that paying attention to one particular aspect of being in, transitioning and surviving these worlds can interrupt not only the stubborn formations of silence in the colonial archive but also the ways that ostensibly tongue-tied archive is continuously used to legitimise and loudly proclaim as ‘historical’ only certain kinds of subjectivity and life of the enslaved Africans. That aspect is gender, or more specifically, gender variance of the enslaved. There {{is a great deal}} of evidence to suggest that, across the societies and historical periods that are of broader relevance here, a gender-variant person would be in many ways a living interruption to the imperial orders of human personhood, an interruption whose presence revealed certain less-obvious inconsistencies in those orders. I begin by (I) sketching out certain social, legal and political positionalities of gender-variant subjectivities in various Muslim empires of the day. I move, then (II), to an examination of numerous accounts of gender variance and transitioning in the spiritual, political and social configurations of the self in West Africa. First, I assess the gendered narratives of the Wolof, Serer and Fulɓe slave warriors in eighteenth-century Senegambia as well as Muslim slave armies that arose against them, many of which included individuals who were castrated in their youth. Second, I explore Bamana and Mandinka cosmologies, linguistic and social practices—replete with androgyny and non-gender-binary ways of being in the world. Third, I revisit colonial accounts of gender variance in and around Ouidah and <b>Cabinda,</b> <b>including</b> those relating to the Dahomey court as well as a more wide-ranging Angolan subjectivity known as chibado/chibanda/quimbanda. Next (III), I interrogate the colonial sources on the Middle Passage. These documents attempted to produce a clear gender-binary structure of the enslaved—a prerequisite for the colonial slave economy that was to be built upon the labour of their bodies. And yet, such attempts weren’t always successful. I examine some such telling failures. Finally (IV), I engage in a detailed re-examination of eighteenth-century Louisianan society, including the accounts of gender variance amongst its indigenous peoples. Against the backdrop of the colonial state’s racing, classing and gendering of its Louisianan subjects, I pay special attention to the ways the enslaved West Africans formed alliances across the imagined and real imperial fault- lines but, also, the ways they managed to retain certain aspects of their linguistic and religious autonomy. With respect to their gender diversity, however, the colonial archives are still largely silent. Instead, what little remains are fragments—modest insurrectionary details—that challenge the logics of pure binarism in cultural, religious and linguistic formations of gender. I examine, in particular, some telling remnants in Louisiana Creole and Louisiana Voodoo...|$|R

40|$|The present paper aims at {{describing}} different pre-verbal focus {{strategies in}} Kisikongo (H 16 a), spoken {{in the vicinity}} of Mbanza Kongo, northern Angola. This western Bantu language is part of the Kikongo Language Cluster (KLC), stretching from southern Gabon to northern Angola, <b>including</b> <b>Cabinda</b> and parts of Congo-Brazzaville and Congo-Kinshasa. Kikongo exhibits a clause-internal pre-verbal argument focus position, which has rarely been reported in Bantu languages, except in Mbuun (B 87) (Bostoen and Mundeke 2012) and Nsong (B 85 d) (Koni Muluwa and Bostoen, this volume), both spoken in the neighboring Kwilu region of the DRC. The more extensively studied eastern and southern Bantu languages generally have a post-verbal argument focus position (cf. Watters 1979, Morimoto 2000, Creissels 2004, Güldemann 2007, Buell 2009, van der Wal 2009, among others). In addition to this mono-clausal argument focus strategy, Kisikongo also relies on different bi-clausal constructions to focus arguments, i. e. cleft-constructions...|$|E
