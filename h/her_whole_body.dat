500|$|The stage show {{included}} new choreography, {{as well as}} Victoria Halkiti and Nektarios Georgiadis as backing vocalists. Kalomoira {{started off}} the show sitting on a diamond sequenced bench held up by her dancers. She then got down and started a dance routine with complex choreography. There was also a large purple book on stage that opened up as a heart shaped pop-up book that Kalomoira stepped out of when she sang the lyrics [...] "an open book". In time with the book opening, Kalomoira removed her pink dress revealing a pink and silver mini-dress underneath. Toward {{the middle of the}} song during the break, the cameras cut to Kalomoira who was doing a provocative dance; shaking <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b> At the end of the song, she was slightly lifted up by her dancers. The background image on stage was a skyline of buildings that moved with glowing lights. She wore clothes exclusively by JLO and managed to finish in first place out of nineteen countries, receiving 156 points.|$|E
2500|$|KITECH {{researched}} and developed EveR-1, an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial [...] "musculature" [...] {{and capable of}} rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is [...] tall and weighs , matching the average figure of a Korean woman in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the Biblical Eve, plus the letter r for robot. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables speech recognition and vocal synthesis, {{at the same time}} processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-CCD cameras with face recognition technology. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. <b>Her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the Ministry of Information and Communication [...] has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020. Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (440 million USD), of which 50 billion is direct government investment. The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.|$|E

6000|$|Feeling <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> slender <b>body</b> {{shaken by}} sobs, he was terribly alarmed. She must have Blank to-morrow. He would insist upon it. He {{could not have}} her like this.... There, there! ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{there is}} such a change in her face, such {{rigidity}} of <b>her</b> [...] <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> that he stops and averts his eyes. When he looks [...] again she is drinking. She puts the glass down, and gives a [...] little laugh.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} tell this also to her own {{consciousness}} and to realize the mighty wave of danger that shook <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The terror faded out of {{her eyes}} and <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> relaxed. “Oh, yes, I do remember,” she said. “And you won one of the canoe races.” ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Yes, very. But you're so {{much more}} than pretty. I expect you have more brains in your little finger than she has in <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
60|$|The man in {{the tent}} seemed to be {{watching}} her with much amusement {{for a moment or}} two, as <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> graceful <b>body</b> stiffened for that absurd and unequal physical contest. He seemed vastly entertained at the sight of this good-looking young woman striving to pit her strength against five sturdy soldiers of the Republic.|$|R
60|$|Ursula was dazed. She {{could still}} feel the touch of the mistress's body against her own--only this, only this. The rest of the {{swimming}} time passed like a trance. When the call was given to leave the water, Miss Inger walked down the bath towards Ursula. Her rust-red, thin tunic was clinging to <b>her,</b> the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> was defined, firm and magnificent, as it seemed to the girl.|$|R
40|$|She {{had come}} to him shortly after he had taken up the farm. Fifteen years, but the day was full of hope and he remembered it like yesterday. She had tumbled down from the truck, long-legged and spindly like a young girl, and stood in the paddock before him, her eyes bright and wild with fear at the bare endless spaces about her. She had never left her mother 2 ̆ 7 s side before, on a coastal farm, ordered, small-fielded, lush and English. But this brown vacancy could swallow <b>her</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> seemed to say, there was nothing to hold her in. It was days before she allowed his hands on her...|$|R
60|$|And she hid {{her face}} in her hands, and {{bursting}} into bitter tears, walked slowly away into her own chamber, <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> convulsed with the internal struggle.|$|E
60|$|I stooped down, and {{her arms}} were {{suddenly}} around me like a vise. She clung to me with <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> and held me so that I could scarcely breathe.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only her}} face, but <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> gave {{a sense of}} alacrity. I nodded. I {{wondered}} if the poor devil had been hammered on the Stock Exchange or run over by an omnibus.|$|E

6000|$|... "Won't {{you take}} off your coat?" [...] she said, looking at him with strange, large dark eyes. A strange woman, he could not {{understand}} her. Yet, as he sat down again, having removed his overcoat, he felt her looking at his limbs, his physical body. And this went against him, {{he did not want}} it. Yet quite fixed in him too was the desire for her, her beautiful white arms, <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> soft white <b>body.</b> And such desire he would not contradict nor allow to be contradicted. It was his will also. <b>Her</b> <b>whole</b> soft white body--to possess it in its entirety, its fulness.|$|R
50|$|The {{surgery is}} {{performed}} in this way: Have the girl {{sit on a}} chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girls thighs. Have him separate and steady <b>her</b> legs and <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b> Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, {{about the size of}} the membrane thats between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; do {{not leave}} me." [...] And <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> was shaken with a tremour, as though of an ague fit. [...] "Do not go away, and I will tell you everything. I did it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Very {{early one}} morning we were awakened by a bustling {{presence}} in the yard, and found our camp had been surprised by a tall, lean, old native lady, dressed in what were obviously widow's weeds. You could see at a glance she was a notable woman, a housewife, sternly practical, alive with energy, and with fine possibilities of temper. Indeed there was nothing native about her but the skin; and the type abounds, and is everywhere respected nearer home. It did us good to see her scour the grounds, examining the plants and chickens; watering, feeding, trimming them; taking angry, purpose-like possession. When she neared the house our sympathy abated; {{when she came to}} the broken chest I wished I were elsewhere. We had scarce a word in common; but <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> lean <b>body</b> spoke for her with indignant eloquence. [...] "My chest!" [...] it cried, with a stress on the possessive. [...] "My chest--broken open! This is a fine state of things!" [...] I hastened to lay the blame where it belonged--on François and his wife--and found I had made things worse instead of better. She repeated the names at first with incredulity, then with despair. A while she seemed stunned, next fell to disembowelling the box, piling the goods on the floor, and visibly computing the extent of François's ravages; and presently after she was observed in high speech with Taniera, who seemed to hang an ear like one reproved.|$|R
60|$|She gave a wild gasp {{of terror}} and {{ran back to the}} chair--like a frightened feline creature, swift and silent--and sank into it, still gasping, <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> shaken now as with fever, her teeth chattering, her limbs numb.|$|E
60|$|It did offend her; I {{thought it}} would. But she looked really {{interesting}} {{when she was}} cross. Her grey eyes would flash, and <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> quiver. There was a charming spice of danger always about making her cross.|$|E
60|$|On {{the instant}} Saxon's brain snapped {{with a white}} flash of light, while <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> relaxed, numb and weak, volitionless, sad her vision reeled and blurred. The next instant she was herself again, in her eyes terror and understanding.|$|E
60|$|But Tiare Johnson {{would never}} under any {{circumstances}} have been rich. She could not keep money. The daughter of a native and an English sea-captain settled in Tahiti, when I knew her {{she was a woman}} of fifty, who looked older, and of enormous proportions. Tall and extremely stout, she would have been of imposing presence if the great good-nature of her face had not made it impossible for her to express anything but kindliness. Her arms were like legs of mutton, her breasts like giant cabbages; her face, broad and fleshy, gave you an impression of almost indecent nakedness, and vast chin succeeded to vast chin. I do not know how many of them there were. They fell away voluminously into the capaciousness of her bosom. She was dressed usually in a pink Mother Hubbard, and she wore all day long a large straw hat. But when she let down her hair, which she did now and then, for she was vain of it, you saw that it was long and dark and curly; and her eyes had remained young and vivacious. Her laughter was the most catching I ever heard; it would begin, a low peal in her throat, and would grow louder and louder till <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> vast <b>body</b> shook. She loved three things -- a joke, a glass of wine, and a handsome man. To have known her is a privilege.|$|R

30|$|A {{limitation}} in {{the current}} study was the use of indirect calorimetry to measure REE and RER, rather than <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> direct calorimetry, which is considered the gold standard. Also, excluding the acute PRO and CHO supplementation, no dietary modifications were made, which could have a potential effect on the acute RER measurement. However, because no modifications were made, the study results may be more practical for a woman who only wants to change her pre-workout nutrition rather than <b>her</b> <b>whole</b> diet. In addition, since this was an acute intervention, and post-exercise measurements were only conducted for 60  min, it is difficult to predict longer term EE and energy substrate utilization. Specifically, EE calculations extrapolate our 60 -min findings to a 24 -h period (using Weir et al. [23] equation), potentially elevating the actual caloric differences (i.e. approximately 800 kcal). Future research should focus on determining the effects of chronic exercise and nutrition modifications in women using <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> calorimetry.|$|R

40|$|Most {{mammalian}} tissues regulate O 2 utilization {{such that}} O 2 consumption (VO 2) is relatively constant at O 2 delivery (DO 2) {{higher than a}} critical value (DO 2 c). We studied the relationship between VO 2 and DO 2 of kidney and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> during graded progressive exsanguination. The relationship between <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 and DO 2 was biphasic, and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 decreased by 5. 6 +/- 14. 4 % (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 c. Kidney DO 2 decreased {{in direct proportion to}} <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 such that the average R 2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO 2 vs. <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 was 0. 94 +/- 0. 02. The relationship between kidney, like <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> VO 2 and DO 2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO 2 decreased by 63. 3 +/- 10. 4 % (P less than 0. 0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO 2 c. Renal O 2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO 2, whereas <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> O 2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 values as <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> DO 2 decreased. However, final values of O 2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> (0. 86 +/- 0. 1) and kidney (0. 86 +/- 0. 06) (P = NS). We conclude that the pattern of kidney and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> VO 2 response to decreasing DO 2 differs during hemorrhage, particularly in the range of DO 2 normally associated with tissue wellness...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution on blood-brain barrier damage, brain edema and morphological changes of rats during <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia. 90 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 5 groups: Control group (a room temperature for 4 hours); <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group without solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with Ringer's solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with hydroxyethyl starch and Ringer's solution treatment; <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia group with Hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution treatment. All rats except those of control group were housed in a heated container and maintained at 36 °C for 3 hours until the rectal temperature reached 41 - 42 °C. Corresponding solutions were administered intravenously at the beginning of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia within 30 minutes as designed. Following <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia, rats were subsequently cooled down for 1 h. Evans blue was administered intravenously when the rectal temperature was cooled down to 37 °C. The leakage of Evans blue-albumin and water content of brain were calculated and morphological changes were investigated. In group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution treatment, brain water content and the leakage of Evans blue-albumin were the lowest among the four <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia groups. Compared with the other three <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia groups, in which profound to moderate damages to blood-brain barrier and brain tissue and cells were found, there were only slight morphological changes in the group with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solutionon treatment. Treatment with hypertonic/hyperoncotic solution appeared to attenuate the injury to blood-brain barrier and reduce brain edema and cell morphological changes in <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> hyperthermia rats...|$|R
40|$|To measure <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> fat accurately, {{the dual}} energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is widely utilized. Simultaneously, bone mineral density (BMD) of the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> {{can also be}} measured. BMD is one of important information to diagnose osteoporosis. However, it is not established to use <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for this diagnosis. It is recommended that lumbar and/or hip BMD {{should be used for}} diagnosing osteoporosis by the guideline for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Although it is possible to measure <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar and/or hip BMD separately at the same visit, it is inevitable to expose patients to more X-ray. Therefore, an aim {{of this study is to}} elucidate the relationship between <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar BMD to find the cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for screening of osteoporosis. Two hundred and thirty six Japanese adult females were ascertained to this study. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD and lumbar BMD of each subject were measured with the use of Delphi W (Hologic, USA).

The cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD for screening possible osteoporosis was estimated by receiver operated characteristic (ROC) analysis. The cut off point of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD was 84 % of YAM, equivalent to 80 % of YAM of lumbar BMD, with the following sensitivity and specificity (0. 84 and 0. 79, respectively), indicating that <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> BMD could be used for screening osteoporosis...|$|R
