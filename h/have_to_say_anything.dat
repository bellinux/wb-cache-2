500|$|While {{working at}} the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based {{producers}} who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While {{working at the}} recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were [...] "saying totally relevant stuff, but I guess it was just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?" [...] For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Elton John {{commented that}} [...] "we {{all know how}} inspiring he is. We all know that his music stands. We don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the music: it speaks for itself. He was innovative, he was boundary-changing, and he danced to his own tune—which in any artist is really rare". John also {{performed}} a cover of [...] "Space Oddity" [...] at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles two days after Bowie's death.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all. I says to 'er {{the next}} morning, 'Now you know,' I says, 'what I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Except {{for that}} letter in this morning's paper I should never <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> you again. But that changes everything.' ...|$|R

6000|$|I saw Anneke colour, and her eye turn hastily towards Dirck. Before I <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{anything}},</b> or <b>to</b> {{do anything}} in fact, she answered steadily-- ...|$|R
60|$|All the {{delicate}} hues of the peach blossom {{went out of}} Cicely's face. That everlasting person had come up again, and now he called her Dora, and it was glorious to have her back! She did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> for Ralph went rapidly on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} you all to remember," [...] said the master pirate, [...] "that when I appoint an officer on this ship, {{there is to be}} no sneering at him nor any want of respect, and it strikes me that I shall not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more on the subject--to this {{precious}} crew, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah your journalist, your journalist, mademoiselle!" [...] said Maxime de Cliche. [...] "I'm {{very sorry}} to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{in regard to}} any friend of yours that can give you so little pleasure; but I promise myself the {{satisfaction}} of administering him with these hands a dressing he won't forget, if I may trouble you {{so far as to}} ask you to let him know it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{ought to}} be a fight, Miss Mackenzie; I know that there ought. I believe I'm right in supposing, if all this is allowed to go by the board as it is going, that you won't <b>have,</b> so <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>anything</b> of your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Dot again, {{and before}} he <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more she saw a {{carriage}} drive {{around to the front}} of the palace. Then the door quickly opened, and what looked to be a lady came out and entered the carriage.|$|R
60|$|Milton {{was a great}} favorite, and he <b>had</b> no time <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> Bettie as peace-maker. He reached Ed as soon as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give you time! How could I {{give you}} time, and he {{here on the}} spot? There's been too much time to my thinking. When young folk are {{agreeable}} and the old folk are agreeable too, there can't be too little time. Come along over and we'll talk {{of it in the}} kitchen while they talks in the parlour. He'd a' been in there among you all only for Mrs. Prime. She is so dour like for a young man to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> before her, of the likes of that. That's why I took him into our place." ...|$|E
60|$|At ten {{and twelve}} Susy wrote plays, {{and she and}} Daisy Warner and Clara played them in the library or up-stairs in the school-room, with only {{themselves}} and the servants for audience. They were of a tragic and tremendous sort, and were performed with great energy and earnestness. They were dramatized (freely) from English history, and in them Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth had few holidays. The clothes were borrowed from the mother's wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary, {{but that was not}} regarded as a defect. In one of these plays Jean (three years old, perhaps) was Sir Francis Bacon. She was not dressed for the part, and did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> but sat silent and decorous at a tiny table and was kept busy signing death-warrants. It was a really important office, for few entered those plays and got out of them alive.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, no, for I don't {{think you}} <b>have</b> the face <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> that would {{distress}} her, or disturb the friendship {{which has been}} her greatest benefit.' ...|$|R
60|$|They {{reached it}} {{in due time}} and Carroll, who <b>had</b> refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about Vane on the way, found the girls a seat in a grove of giant firs and sat down {{opposite}} to them. Though it was winter, the day, {{as is often the}} case near Vancouver, was pleasantly mild.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> hesitated <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about it," [...] Lessingham went on, [...] "because {{there is}} so much {{uncertainty}} about these things, but I believe that it is now finally arranged. I think that within the next week or ten days--perhaps a little before, perhaps a little later--your brother Richard will be set at liberty." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No. At first I thought I {{would do}} so, {{but he looked}} so down-and-out that I didn't <b>have</b> the heart <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> and perhaps make him feel worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{train them}} any," [...] began Toby; {{and then he}} <b>had</b> no time <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more, for Ben, who had been talking with the manager, called to him.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hemphill turned pale when, that afternoon, his hostess, in an {{exceedingly}} clear and plain manner, made known to him his fate. For {{a few moments}} he did not speak. Then he said very quietly: [...] "If she had not, of her own accord, {{told me that she}} had once loved me, I should never <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> like that <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before I ask you any {{questions}} I {{must tell you}} that {{you have the right to}} remain silent.This means you do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> answer any question or make any statement unless you wish to do so.However, if you do say something or make a statement, it may later be used as evidence. Do you understand? ...|$|E
5000|$|Kwong then quoted several verses in Book of Isaiah {{to support}} his claim that Jesus {{remained}} silent {{in the face of}} crucifixion, saying, [...] "Jesus remained silent in the face of Pilate. He was like a lamb awaiting slaughter." [...] He further added, [...] "sometimes we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Silence is better than saying anything." ...|$|E
50|$|A suspect {{arrested in}} Israel is {{typically}} interrogated by police. Though police {{are allowed to}} lie to a suspect during interrogation, anyone facing police interrogation {{has the right to}} consult a lawyer beforehand, and an interrogating officer must warn a suspect that he or she does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> self-incriminating, and that anything said might be used against them in court.|$|E
5000|$|Emblems {{are certain}} {{gestures}} {{which have a}} specific meaning attached to them. These meanings usually {{are associated with the}} culture they are established in. Using emblems creates a way for humans to communicate with one another in a non-verbal way. An individual waving their hand at a friend, for example, would communicate [...] "hello" [...] without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> verbally <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Even then Pony {{would not}} have <b>had</b> the courage <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> but Jim Leonard was just behind him with another bucket of water, and he spoke up for him. [...] "He wants {{to go with the}} circus." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was hurt}} between the past glamour with Miriam and the {{knowledge}} that his mother fretted. He <b>had</b> meant not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>to</b> refuse to answer. But he could not harden his heart to ignore his mother.|$|R
5000|$|In Portugal, a {{variation}} on this game is called [...] "Puque" [...] (reads as Poock, in English). The rules are almost the same, with the 2 replacing the 8 as the [...] "skip turn" [...] card. One must say Puque when one plays his next-to-last card, and doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> different from end with a Jack, still getting the double score.|$|E
50|$|You do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{unless you}} wish to do so, but I must warn {{you that if you}} fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this {{opportunity}} to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. If you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence.|$|E

6000|$|... "So you {{had made}} a wager! Now we are <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some news at last. How stupid of you, Richard, not to tell me before. I confess I wonder what these wits find in your company. Here am I who have seen naught but dull women for a fortnight, and you <b>have</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> amusing in {{a quarter of an}} hour. Let us hear about the wager." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{cut out for}} a general, I am afraid; but if--I don't say if I could marry that woman--I {{suppose it}} would be a foolish thing--though I shall break my heart, I believe, if I do not. Oh, Mrs. Mellot, you cannot tell what a fool I have made myself about her; and I cannot help it! It's not her beauty merely; but there is {{something}} so noble in her face, like one of those Greek goddesses Claude talks of; and when she is acting, if she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> grand, or generous--or--you know the sort of thing,--she brings it out with such a voice, and such a look, from the very bottom of her heart,--it makes me shudder; just as she did when she told that Yankee, that every one could be a hero, or a martyr, if he chose. Mrs. Mellot, I am sure she is one, or she could not look and speak as she does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! But with {{a gentleman}} it's so {{different}} and really {{you look so}} amazingly well that you <b>have</b> no right <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> of the kind, while, as to me, you know--oh!' cried Flora with a little scream, 'I am dreadful!' ...|$|R
