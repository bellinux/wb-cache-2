5|$|Similarly, Luigi Russolo, the Italian Futurist {{painter and}} composer, {{wrote of the}} {{possibilities}} of new music in his 1913 manifestoes The Art of Noises and Musica Futurista. He also invented and built instruments such as the intonarumori, mostly percussion, which were used in a precursor to the style known as musique concrète. One {{of the most influential}} events in early 20th century music was the return of Alfredo Casella from France in 1915; Casella founded the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, which promoted several composers in disparate styles, ranging from experimental to traditional. After a dispute over the value of <b>experimental</b> <b>music</b> in 1923, Casella formed the Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche to promote modern <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{the stylistic}} {{blueprint}} of Debut, Post {{is considered an}} important exponent of art pop and {{is known for its}} eclecticism, mainly incorporating electronic and dance styles—such as techno, trip hop, IDM and house—but also ambient, jazz, industrial and <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b> A reflection of Björk's new life in London, Post features songs she wrote after moving to England and was intended to convey the fast pace and urban culture of the city, deviating from the themes of its predecessor, which focused on the compositions the singer had written in Iceland. It also centres on the contemporary styles of British underground club culture, with which the singer had established close ties.|$|E

5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of <b>experimental</b> <b>music,</b> atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E
5|$|Linda Hopper—a {{native of}} Marietta, Georgia—was {{a member of}} the late 1970s/early 1980s music scene in Athens, Georgia, where she befriended fellow University of Georgia student Michael Stipe in an art design class. Stipe went on to form R.E.M. and Hopper joined him in the <b>experimental</b> <b>music</b> group Tanzplagen along with Stipe's sister, Lynda, and other local musicians. After the group folded, Stipe and Hopper formed Oh-OK, whose line-up later {{included}} Matthew Sweet and David McNair. That project ended in 1984 and Hopper briefly belonged to a Washington, D.C. band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{produced}} by Tricky with assistance from Mark Saunders, who helped him utilize dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken {{from a variety of}} musical sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b> The songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, and recreational drug use. In writing them, Tricky drew on his experiences in the British drug culture and the influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E

5|$|Noé's dream {{project for}} many years, the {{production}} {{was made possible}} after the commercial success of his previous feature film, Irréversible (2002). Enter the Void was primarily financed by Wild Bunch, while Fidélité Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and psychedelic drug experiences. Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo, and involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie, which also provided the computer-generated imagery. The film's soundtrack is a collage of electronic pop and <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars has {{consistently}} enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is {{noted for its}} energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared {{to the sounds of}} bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b> Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s.|$|E

50|$|A musical {{argument}} {{is a means}} of creating tension through the relation of expressive content and musical form: Traditional dialectal music is representational: the musical form relates to an expressive content and {{is a means of}} creating a growing tension; this is what is usually called the musical argument.

5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing <b>experimental</b> <b>music</b> {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more <b>experimental</b> <b>music.</b> Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was {{produced}} by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame {{with the release of}} their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated <b>experimental</b> <b>music</b> as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide.|$|E
