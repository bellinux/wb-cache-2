5|$|Recognising {{that his}} force {{was at a}} disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> no signs of movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for {{personal}} reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl {{would have had to}} either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working <b>Group</b> <b>showed</b> that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E

Manual methods also involve time constraints that place limitations on the number of data streams that can be incorporated into the forecast, which therefore limits forecasting accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Two {{independent}} studies {{published in}} the journal Nature in 2010 November confirmed the ability of tumors to make their own blood vessels. When one group found that tumor stem cells could make their own blood vessels and avastin could not inhibit their early differentiation, the other <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> that selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by tumor-derived stem cells in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction. These studies done in glioblastoma model may have implications in other tumors.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} study on motor {{functional}} recovery after {{spinal cord injuries}} in mice showed that after human-induced pluripotent stem cells were transplanted into the mice, the cells differentiated into three neural lineages in the spinal cord. The cells stimulated regrowth of the damaged spinal cord, maintained myelination, and formed synapses. These positive outcomes were observed for over 112 days after the spinal cord injury, without tumor formation. Nevertheless, a follow-up study by the same <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> distinct clones of human-induced pluripotent stem cells eventually formed tumors.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{biological}} {{evaluation of}} (+)-discodermolide by the Longley <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> {{that it has}} immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo. The immunosuppression response was observed at a relatively low concentration that (+)-discodermolide was non-toxic in vitro. In both human peripheral blood leukocytes and murine splenocytes, (+)-discodermolide was found to suppress the two-way mixed lymphocyte reaction. In addition, mitogenic response of peripheral blood leukocytes was also suppressed by the (+)-discodermolide. Follow up experiments demonstrated that (+)-discodermolide also has anti-proliferative effects in several other non-lymphoid cell lines.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by the same <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> that (R)-citalopram also enhances binding of escitalopram, and therefore the allosteric interaction cannot explain the observed counteracting effect. In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (R)-citalopram decreases binding of escitalopram to the transporter. Although allosteric binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the allosteric site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.|$|E
25|$|Each of the {{patients}} of VR went through 3 weeks, 5 days a week, of 30-minute intervals emerged in these programs. The controls went through the equivalent time in traditional rehabilitation therapies. Each patient took the star cancellation test, line bisection test, and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) 24 hours {{before and after the}} three-week treatment to assess the severity of unilateral spatial neglect. The VR <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> a higher increase in the star cancellation test and CBS scores after treatment than the control group (p<0.05), but both groups did not show any difference in the line bisection test and K-MBI before and after treatment. These results suggest that virtual reality programs can be more effective then conventional rehabilitation and thus should be further researched.|$|E

25|$|Music {{has proven}} {{useful in the}} {{recovery}} of motor skills. Rhythmical auditory stimulation in a musical context in combination with traditional gait therapy improved the ability of stroke patients to walk. The study consisted of two treatment conditions, one which received traditional gait therapy and another which received the gait therapy {{in combination with the}} rhythmical auditory stimulation. During the rhythmical auditory stimulation, stimulation was played back measure by measure, and was initiated by the patient's heel-strikes. Each condition received fifteen sessions of therapy. The results revealed that the rhythmical auditory stimulation <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> more improvement in stride length, symmetry deviation, walking speed and rollover path length (all indicators for improved walking gait) than the group that received traditional therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting <b>Group</b> <b>showed</b> that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has. Though some may call it a modern-day version of McCarthyism, another prevalent issue also remains members of our own society sending disconcerting emails to one another. It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E
25|$|Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern {{discovered}} the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910–11. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924.

After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent {{the majority of the}} antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's <b>group</b> <b>showed</b> the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.|$|E
