5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> of their motion in flight. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by <b>doppler</b> <b>shift</b> as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

Signals in high-mobility systems could experience large <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifts</b> in the order of kilohertz, while most conventional wireless communication systems are designed for <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifts</b> up to a few hundred hertz. The large <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifts</b> result in fast time-varying fading, {{which is one of the}} main challenges for the design of reliable high-mobility systems.

5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given <b>Doppler</b> <b>shift</b> value.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a <b>doppler</b> <b>shift</b> in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E

Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E
