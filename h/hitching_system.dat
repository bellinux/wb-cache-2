Its main function is to hook and control agricultural machines working position. The hydraulic <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> {{is an important}} part of modern agricultural tractor work unit. The research on the hydraulic <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> control method, is the basis of ensuring that the tractor work unit reach the optimal performance. This paper analyzes the tractor hitch control function, introduces the principle of electro-hydraulic control of tractor ploughing depth, and the tractor mechanical hydraulic hitch equipment as the basis, using electric hydraulic control to replace the original mechanical hydraulic control, improved design of automatic control system. The novel electro-hydraulic <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> having multiple parameter stability comprehensive regulation performance, can replace the traditional mechanical type regulating device, to achieve depth homogeneous, stable work...|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, as patents on the {{technology}} expired, tractor and implement manufacturers {{agreed on the}} three-point hitch as the one standard, interchangeable, full-featured <b>system</b> to <b>hitch</b> implements to tractors. With the advent of nonproprietary status, the manufacturers were able to refine the system and create useful modifications. Now, nearly all manufacturers have adopted some standardised form of the modern three-point hitch system; many companies also offer safe adaptation kits for converting the non-standard <b>hitch</b> <b>systems</b> to the three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bicycle trailer is a motorless {{wheeled frame}} with a <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> for {{transporting}} cargo by bicycle. It can greatly increase a bike's cargo capacity, allowing point-to-point haulage of objects up to 4 cubic yards (3 cubic metres) in volume that weigh {{as much as}} half a ton.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 Ferguson made a {{handshake}} agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson System Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson's own self-regulating three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system,</b> {{beginning with the}} Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is recognizable by the blue Ford emblem {{on the front of}} the hood and the Ferguson System emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favourite <b>hitch</b> attachment <b>system</b> among farmers in North America and around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three-point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|R
50|$|The power {{produced}} by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment. This may be accomplished via a drawbar or <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|R

50|$|The 9N was {{the first}} American-made production-model tractor to {{incorporate}} Harry Ferguson's three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system,</b> a design still used on most modern tractors today. It was released in October 1939. The 2N, introduced in 1942, was the 9N with some improved details. The 8N, which debuted in July 1947, was a largely new machine featuring more power and an improved transmission. It {{proved to be the}} most popular farm tractor of all time in North America.|$|R
5000|$|The three-point hitch {{revolutionized}} farm {{tractors and}} their implements. While the Ferguson system {{was still under}} patent, other manufacturers developed new <b>hitching</b> <b>systems</b> to try to fend off some of Ferguson's competitive advantage. For example, International Harvestor's Farmall tractors gained a two-point [...] "Fast Hitch", and John Deere had a power lift that was similar to, but not as flexible as, the Ferguson invention. Once the patent protection expired on the three-point hitch, it became an industry standard.|$|R
50|$|Three Point <b>Hitch</b> - <b>system</b> with {{hydraulic}} lift and 540 RPM PTO (power take off) will accept Category 1 {{three point hitch}} attachment.|$|R
50|$|Drawbars were {{appropriate}} to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear. As the history of mechanization progressed, however, the advantages of other <b>hitching</b> <b>systems</b> became apparent, leading to new developments (see below). Depending on the function for which a tractor is used, though, the drawbar {{is still one of}} the usual means of attaching an implement to a tractor (see photo at left).|$|R
50|$|The hitch {{lifting arms}} are {{powered by the}} tractor's own {{hydraulic}} system. The hydraulic system {{is controlled by the}} operator, and usually a variety of settings are available. A draft control mechanism is often present in modern three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>systems.</b> The draft of the implement, the amount of force it is taking to pull the implement, is sensed on the lower arms and the hydraulic system automatically raises the arms slightly when the draft increases and lowers the arms when the draft decreases.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} the three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> utilized on farm tractors, invented by Harry Ferguson of Ireland. Harry Ferguson partnered with Henry Ford to mass produce the farm tractor's first dominant design which prominently featured the Ferguson System, also called the three-point hitch. First introduced to farmers in 1939, the three-point hitch was the innovation that allowed farmers to upgrade from animal power to machine power. The Ferguson System revolutionized mechanized agriculture because it allowed farmers to increase productivity far beyond the capabilities of their traditional animal power...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{enterprise}} manufactured the Ferguson plough {{incorporating the}} patented [...] "Duplex" [...] <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> mainly {{intended for the}} Fordson [...] "F" [...] tractor. Following several more years of development, Ferguson's new hydraulic version of the three-point linkage was first seen on his prototype Ferguson [...] "Black", now in the Science Museum, Kensington, London. A production version of the [...] "Black" [...] was introduced in May 1936, made {{at one of the}} David Brown factories in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and designated Ferguson Model A tractor. In 1938, Ferguson's interests were merged with those of David Brown junior to create the Ferguson-Brown Company.|$|R
50|$|The Farmall H, {{produced}} from 1939 to 1954 (the last two model {{years it was}} sold as the Super H, but was the same basic tractor with a slightly larger engine and disc type brakes), became the number two selling tractor model of all time in North America with 420,011 sold, (the last 28,784 being Super H's). Only the Ford 8n (due primarily to Ford's much greater economies of scale, the fact it sold for a significantly lower price, in 1952 versus $2000 for the H the same year and to its exclusive Ferguson Three Point <b>Hitch</b> <b>system)</b> was a slightly better seller, at 524,076 sold. The Farmall H, however, {{was and still is}} the number one selling row crop tractor of all time.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{benefit of}} the three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> is to {{transfer}} the weight and resistance of an implement to the drive wheels of the tractor. This gives the tractor more usable traction than it would otherwise have, given the same power, weight, and fuel consumption. For example, when the Ford 9N introduced Harry Ferguson's three-point hitch design to American production-model tractors in 1939, it was a light and affordable tractor competing principally with row-crop tractors such as Farmalls that {{did not yet have}} three-point hitches. At 2500 lb, the 9N could plow more than 12 acre in a normal day pulling two 14 in plows, outperforming the tractive performance of the heavier and more expensive Farmall F-30 model. The hitch's utility and simplicity have since made it an industry standard.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical three point hitch regulation in mouldboard ploughing. Increase of working velocity and three point hitch automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both regulation systems but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical regulation system. Electro-hydraulic three point <b>hitch</b> control <b>system</b> decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical regulation system. Net energy requirement at mechanical three point <b>hitch</b> regulation <b>system</b> spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value. The greatest working rates were achieved at the greatest working velocity (8, 0 km h- 1), while exactly at that velocity the greatest working rate increase of 3, 8 % influenced by electro-hydraulic three point hitch control was noticed...|$|R
50|$|A {{motorcycle}} trailer may be {{a trailer}} designed to haul motorcycles behind an automobile or truck. Such trailers may be open or enclosed, {{ranging in size from}} trailers capable of carrying several motorcycles or only one. They may be designed specifically to carry motorcycles, with ramps and tie-downs, or {{may be a}} utility trailer adapted permanently or occasionally to haul one or more motorcycles. Another type of motorcycle trailer is a wheeled frame with a <b>hitch</b> <b>system</b> designed for transporting cargo by motorcycle. Motorcycle trailers are often narrow and styled to match the appearance of the motorcycle they are intended to be towed behind. You can get either two wheeled versions or single wheeled version. The single wheeled versions, such as the Unigo or Pav 40/41, are designed to allow the bike to have all the normal flexibility of a motorcycle, usually using a universal joint to enable the trailer to lean and turn with the motorcycle. No motorcycle manufacturer recommends that its motorcycles be used to tow a trailer because it creates additional safety hazards for motorcyclists.|$|R

5000|$|In Ireland, {{businessman}} Harry Ferguson {{had been}} developing and selling various improved hitches, implements, and tractors since the 1910s. His first tractors were adapted from Model T cars. In 1920 and 1921 he gave demonstrations at Cork and Dearborn of his hitches and implements as aftermarket attachments to Fordson tractors. The hitches were mechanical at the time. By 1926, {{he and a}} team of longtime colleagues (including Willie Sands and Archie Greer) had developed a good hydraulic three-point hitch. Ferguson put such hitches on Fordsons throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. In the mid-1930s, he had David Brown Ltd build Ferguson-brand tractors with his hitches and implements. In 1938, Eber Sherman, importer of Fordsons from England to the United States and a friend of both Ford and Ferguson, arranged to have Ferguson demonstrate his tractor for Henry Ford. [...] In October 1938 the Ferguson tractor was put through a demonstration before Ford and his engineers. It was light in weight relative to its power, which impressed Ford. Ferguson's successful tractor demonstration led to a handshake agreement with Ford in 1938, whereby Ford would manufacture tractors using the Ferguson three-point <b>hitch</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|Harry Ferguson {{applied for}} a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, a three-point {{attachment}} of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering.

In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite <b>hitch</b> attachment <b>system</b> among farmers around the world.

5000|$|The {{ability to}} store verbal {{material}} in working memory, and {{the storage of}} verbal material in short-term memory relies on a phonological loop. This loop, proposed by Baddeley and <b>Hitch,</b> represents a <b>system</b> that is composed of a short-term store in which memory is represented phonologically, and a rehearsal process. This rehearsal preserves and refreshes the material by re-enacting it and re-presenting it to short-term storage, and subvocalization is {{a major component of}} this rehearsal. The phonological loop system features an interaction between subvocal rehearsal and specific storage for phonological material. [...] The phonological loop contributes {{to the study of the}} role of subvocalization and the inner voice in auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological loop interact in a non-dependent manner demonstrated by their differential requirements on different tasks. The role of subvocalization within the workings of memory processes is heavily reliant on its involvement with Baddeley's proposed phonological loop.|$|R
40|$|The field {{performances}} of agricultural field machineries in South -East agricultural zone of Nigeria were assessed, to enable farmers and agriculturists select suitable farm machines/implements based on soil conditions/characteristics for their agricultural activities. The various implements studied include; disc plough, 2 -gang tandem disc harrow, ridger, rotovator and 6 -row combine seed planter. Three different makes and models of tractors namely: New Holland (model-NH 5610 SE and capacity- 55. 9 kw), Massey Ferguson (model-MF 430 E and capacity- 55. 2 kw) and Mahindra (model-NH 7570 E and capacity- 55. 9 kw) with 3 - point <b>hitch</b> <b>systems</b> and {{average age of}} 1. 3 years were used to study the field {{performances of}} each of the implements, in five different states that made up the study area. The field performances studied include; implements working speed, operation time, depth of cut, effective and theoretical field capacities, field efficiency, fuel consumption rate, implement power requirements, and wheel slippage, under different soil conditions. Results obtained revealed that the disc plough had field efficiency range of 85. 74 % to 88. 55 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 846 to 1. 164 ha/hr and 0. 961 to 1. 319 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (ploughing) efficiency was obtained in loamy-sandy soil when the plough was operated with the Massey Ferguson tractor. Harrow recorded field efficiency range of 80. 17 to 91. 38 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 931 to 1. 458 ha/hr and 1. 151 to 1. 667 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (harrowing) efficiency was obtained on sandy-clay soil by New Holland tractor. Ridger recorded 83. 65 to 88. 82 % field efficiency, 0. 932 to 1. 322 ha/hr effective capacity and 1. 073 to 1. 504 ha/hr theoretical field capacity; and sandy-clay gave the highest field (ridging) efficiency when operated with a New Holland tractor. The rotovator had field efficiency range of 81. 10 to 89. 81 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 759 to 0. 902 ha/hr and 0. 758 to 1. 039 ha/hr respectively; and the highest pulverizing efficiency was achieved on the clay-loam soil with a Massey Ferguson tractor. The planter recorded 80. 63 to 89. 37 field efficiency, 1. 012 to 1. 481 ha/hr effective field capacity and theoretical field capacity of 1. 22 to 1. 716 ha/hr. Ploughing gave the highest average fuel consumption rate of 22. 72 L/ha (8. 89 L/hr), followed by harrowing with average consumption of 19. 57 L/ha (8. 04 L/hr), ridging recorded 19. 42 L/ha (7. 97 L/hr), rotovator had 16. 79 L/ha (7. 19 L/hr) and least was planter with average consumption rate of 15. 10 L/ha (6. 26 L/hr). More so, all implements recorded highest tyre slippage in sandy-clay soil, followed by loamy-sandy and the least slippage was recorded in the clay-loam soil. Results finally revealed that the highest draft force (10. 8 kN/m) was obtained by the plough, followed by the harrow and ridger with equal draft force values of 10. 5 kN/m respectively and least draft was recorded by the rotovator (5. 1 kN/m) ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} can {{be predicted}} in real-time {{by measuring the}} draught of a cutting tool, when the depth is held constant by the three-point <b>hitch</b> position control <b>system</b> of the tractor. A semi-analytical model was developed for {{the conversion of the}} voltage applied to the hydraulic subsystem of an agricultural tractor to the depth under the soil surface of an attached cutting tool (subsoiler) for online measurement of spatial variation in soil compaction. The model consisted of two distinct submodels: a model for the agricultural tractor based on a kinematic and dynamic analysis of the tractor in the XY plane and a `grey box' model for the hydraulic subsystem. The order of this `grey box' model was determined using a theoretical, mechanistic approach, while the parameters for the model structure have been determined using data-based modelling techniques. Both submodels have been coupled and successfully validated by comparing experimental results with those predicted by the model. It is concluded that the tractor dynamics are not excited by the activity of the hydraulic subsystem, when the subsoiler is attached. Therefore, a reduced model consisting of the hydraulic subsystem model multiplied by a conversion factor was found to be appropriate for the design of a depth controller for the soil compaction sensor.

The objectives of this thesis have been to develop a fast simulation model to replicate the functioning of an excavators system and the analysis of a tractor rear hitch controls. Both topics are of substantial importance in today’s industrial research scenario. With a large demand being placed on more intelligent development of construction and agricultural equipment to meet the changing needs of the worlds economy, this thesis offers its contribution in the meeting of these requirements.

From the viewpoint of designing and tuning an efficient control system, an excavator is a very complex nonlinear plant. To design and tune such a complex control system an extremely good nonlinear model of the plant is necessary. The problem of modeling an excavator is considered in this document; a nonlinear mathematical model of an excavator has been developed using the AMESim® modeling environment to replicate actual operating conditions. The excavator model is described by detailed models of the main pump, mobile valve block, actuators and a completely developed kinematic model. The objective of this research is to develop a complete simulation model of an excavator with the capability of reproducing the actual characteristics of the system. This part presents the developed model of a complete excavator system with detailed verification of individual components and preliminary results of a complete excavator system. PART 2 This part of the thesis describes the work carried out towards mathematical modeling and analysis of a tractor rear hitch control valve (HCV). The HCV operates in two modes namely lifting and lowering. The lifting circuit incorporates a pressure compensated flow control valve, while the lowering circuit is gravity assisted. The HCV is a load-sensing system; load-sensing systems and pressure compensated valves are classified as feedback systems. Systems with feedback offer scope for tuning and towards this objective the pressure compensator has been linearised and its characteristics analyzed. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a complete mathematical model of the HCV. This would help to better understand its functionality and to quantify the energy losses across its components...|$|R

As {{a result of this}} year's project, we proposed "Tsuneishi Smart Community" system. This systemutilized strong and active local community, which is valuable social capital in Tsuneishi area. Through our project, we clarified five core issues in Tsuneishi area. Communication, traffic, shopping, education and land are their core issues. We interviewed residents in Tsuneishi for 5 times. At first, we defined four problems from the VOC by using KJ diagram. i. Traffic problem caused by lack of public transport system and narrow road. ii. People can't drive a car have difficulty to go shopping iii. Children must go other area for higher education. iv. Narrow land restrict to build new buildings and houses In this project, we defined "revitalization" as improving these problems. We selected traffic problem as most important. The land problem is given environment, and has huge challenge to improve it. Causal loop diagram shows that the shopping and education problem will be solved by traffic system. While the interview, people mentioned about the traffic problem most frequently. According to the questionnaire responded by Tsuneishi residents, 60 % people think that the traffic problem is the most important. Additional interview and observation conducted after we defined four problems showed us the other problem: communication gap in Tsuneishi area. There are 3 major gaps between sub-communities, such as different generation, different town association, or Tsuneishi Employee and other residents. On the other hand, we found out that there are active local community. They have many event and communication in the community center. It is the wonderful resource in Tsuneishi. CVCA included interview results shows us that these sub-communities have no relations each other. WCA result is similar. As a result of concept generation, we reached "On Demand Bus" system as initial idea. On Demand Bus System is the public transportation system with flexible bus operation is regarding user demand. QFD result shows time to destination and distance to bus stop are key quality metric in transportation system design. In this phase this system seems suitable solution.. In the next phase, we used Pugh selection to compare traffic systems. Both of On Demand Bus System and Car Sharing System show similar advantage, so we combined each advantage and propose new system. On Demand Bus System has challenge on sustainable profit. The system is introduced in the many community, butalmost all of these cases require the subsidy from local govenment Usually 70 % of incomes are subsidies. The system is very useful for substitute of the local fixed route bus, {{but it is difficult to}} operate for private enterprises. From the study result we made, we recommend <b>Hitch</b> Life Community <b>System.</b> The system has a concept "we are all friends in Tsuneishi". The system is the membership carpool system in Tsuneishi utilize strong human network. A fundamental use-case is described below. Drivers and users made member registration first. A driver responds to a user's hitchhike usually. User interface is local SNS and Kairanban: a notice around from house to house in the neighborhood. A user can check operation status of a car and make reservation. A driver pick up users could earn local currency as incentive. Moreover, the system uses the bus already operated inside the Tsuneishi HD factory as a On Demand Bus in the high demands time as morning. Income source of the system is user's registration fee, advertise revenue on the car and sales of cooperation stores. We carried out field survey of the French Covoiturage system as the system's benchmark. Covoiturage is the carpool system using SNS started by a venture enterprise. The system is intended to transport from a local city to other local city in French. At first, users and drivers write their schedule and search for travel partner. Users have to negotiate with a driver from several days before. A user pays a part of highway cost and gasoline cost for a driver. Now, Covoiturage is a governmental promotion enterprise and has 1, 000, 000 users. In the early phase of this system, Tsuneishi HD will recommend their employee, which occupies the half of the daytime population in Tsuneishi area becoming a driver to provide drivers need in early phase. We assume that student who attends school not located in Tsuneishi area will be major user in early phase. Biggest risk of thinking has uneasiness to the responsibility and safety in case of a traffic accident. It seems that both user and driver feel anxious from result of questionnaire. As a countermeasure, evaluation system of the driver similar to covoirturage could be introduced...|$|R
