He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a {{motorcycle}} escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is <b>happening.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E

25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} that increase accuracy of NGS platforms such as barcoding techniques and circle sequencing method. The data generated by these methods the same as NGS platforms originate from single strand of DNA and therefore the errors that are introduced during PCR amplification, tissue processing or DNA extraction can still be distinguished as a true variant. Duplex sequencing method solve this problem {{by taking advantage of}} complementary nature of two strands of DNA and confirming only variants that are present in both strands of DNA. Since the probability of two errors <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same exact base pair in both strands and resulting in a complementary basepair is very low, duplex sequencing increases the accuracy of sequencing significantly.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a subtle}} {{difference}} or distinction between {{these two types of}} simultaneity Gleizes describes that deserve closer attention: inscribed onto the canvas could be either (1) the properties of two or more instantiations or physical occurrence <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time {{from the point of view}} of one frame of reference (the artist fixed in one position), or (2) the artist could inscribe (paint) the properties of one event represented over a succession of time intervals, observed from several frame of reference (or multiple points of view simultaneously expressed onto the canvas), meaning that the observational reference frame is tied to the state of motion of an observer. There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.|$|E
25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified energy fields. Taking light as an example, receptors in our eyes turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in our eye is triggered our brain energy field merges with the energy field of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events at the source and at the receiver are <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional energy field remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement at the source. It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|E

25|$|As {{the show}} progressed into the 1990s, EastEnders still {{featured}} hard-hitting {{issues such as}} Mark Fowler discovering he was HIV positive in 1991, {{the death of his}} wife Gill from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, adoption, abortion, Peggy Mitchell's battle with breast cancer, and Phil Mitchell's alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as the condition was more common among the gay community. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

John J.

[...] In a later piece by O'Connor in 1975, he wrote that TVTV [...] "gained a respectable measure of national success with 'The Lord of the Universe'".|$|E

500|$|Much of folk {{psychology}} {{involves the}} attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists {{point out that}} these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An {{example of this is}} the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics have no place in the neurosciences, which speak of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature. Hence, the syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can have no place in such a structure as the brain. Against this there have been two responses. On the one hand, there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and see this as a straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to [...] "a language of thought". They assert that the mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what's <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> physical level.|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's <b>happening</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
