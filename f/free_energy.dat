40|$|The linear finite {{difference}} Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) {{equation is}} applied to the calculation of the electrostatic binding <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of a group of inhibitors to the Neuraminidase enzyme. An ensemble of enzyme-inhibitor complex conformations was generated using Monte Carlo simulations and the electrostatic binding <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of subtly different configurations of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were calculated. It was seen that the binding <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> calculated using FDPB depend strongly on the configuration of the complex taken from the ensemble. This configurational dependence was investigated in detail in the electrostatic hydration <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of the inhibitors. Differences in hydration energies of up to 7 kcal mol(- 1) were obtained for root mean square (RMS) structural deviations of only 0. 5 Angstrom. To verify the result, the grid size and parameter dependence of the calculated hydration <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> were systematically investigated. This showed that the absolute hydration <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> calculated using the FDPB equation were very sensitive to the values of key parameters, but that the configurational dependence of the <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> was independent of the parameters chosen. Thus just as molecular mechanics energies are very sensitive to configuration, and single-structure values are not typically used to score binding <b>free</b> <b>energies,</b> single FDPB energies should be treated with the same caution...|$|R

5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Helical {{membrane}} proteins (HMPs) play crucial {{roles in}} a variety of cellular processes. Unlike water-soluble proteins, HMPs need not only to fold but also get inserted into the membrane to be fully functional. This process of membrane insertion is mediated by the translocon complex. Thus, it is of great interest to develop com-putational methods for predicting the translocon-mediated mem-brane insertion <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of protein sequences. Result: We have developed Membrane Insertion (MINS), a novel sequence-based computational method for predicting the mem-brane insertion <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of protein sequences. A benchmark test gives a correlation coefficient of 0. 74 between predicted and observed <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> for 357 known cases, which corresponds to a mean unsigned error of 0. 41 kcal/mol. These results are signifi-cantly better than those obtained by traditional hydropathy analysis. Moreover, the ability of MINS to reasonably predict membrane insertion <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of protein sequences allows for effective identification of transmembrane (TM) segments. Subsequently, MINS was applied to predict the membrane insertion <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of 316 TM segments found in known structures. An in-depth analysis of the predicted <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> reveals a number of interesting findings about the biogenesis and structural stability of HMPs.

We compute the dependence of the <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> on the radius of the sphere by using dimensional regularization. It is shown that the first (second) derivative of the <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> in odd (even) dimensions {{with respect to the}} radius of the sphere are proportional to the square of the beta functions of coupling constants. The result is consistent with the c, F and a-theorems in two, three, four and six dimensions.
