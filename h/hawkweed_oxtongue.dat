40|$|Ten {{hydroalcoholic}} extracts of edible {{plants from}} the Calabria region (Italy) were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and antiradical properties and in vivo topical anti-inflammatory activity. All the extracts had radical-scavenging and/or antioxidant properties, {{the most active}} plants being <b>hawkweed</b> <b>oxtongue</b> and viper’s bugloss. The best free radical (DPPH°) -scavenging activity was found in <b>hawkweed</b> <b>oxtongue</b> and chicory leaves extracts (IC 50 = 25 and 26 µg/ml, respectively). <b>Hawkweed</b> <b>oxtongue,</b> poppy and viper’s bugloss extracts showed the greatest inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation (IC 50 = 3 µg/ml). Viper’s bugloss and <b>hawkweed</b> <b>oxtongue</b> extracts had the greatest antioxidant effect on bovine brain peroxidation (IC 50 = 11 and 22 µg/ml). All the extracts also showed an anti-inflammatory effect: 300 µg/cm 2 provoked oedema reductions ranging from 18 % to 43 %. Cress was the most active plant. Chicory leaves contained the highest amount of phenolics (190 mg/g) whilst Rush crimps con...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding past {{reactions}} of ecosystems under natural and anthropic constraints is of crucial importance {{to anticipate the}} consequences of the current global changes. Unraveling natural and anthropic impacts on environments requires the reconstruction of ancient land-uses. As a part of a larger project aiming at developing new molecular biomarkers in soils that could be specific of their overlying vegetation, we have analyzed the neutral lipid content of soils developed under distinct types of plants. Soils were sampled around Lake Aydat, in Central France, of which the catchment is covered with pastures/meadows, forests and moors. The ketone/ester lipid fraction from soils under pastures or meadows contains a series of 14 pentacyclic triterpenyl acetates with a large structural diversity (Fig. 1). This discovery motivated an extensive phytochemical literature survey (240 references) that showed restricted potential sources of triterpenyl acetates. -amyrin, taraxeryl, glutinyl, -amyrin, and multiflorenyl, acetates are found in very distinct taxa and are thus poorly informative. Conversely, lupeyl, bauerenyl, isobauerenyl, taraxasteryl and -taraxasteryl acetates appear more specific since they are majoritary reported in Asteraceae. Pichierenyl, isopichierenyl and gammacerenyl acetates seem to be the more specific ones since they are produced by a single known species, Picris hieracioides L. (<b>hawkweed</b> <b>oxtongue,</b> Asteraceae) ...|$|E
