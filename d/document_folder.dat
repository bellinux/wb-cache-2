40|$|This paper {{describes}} our {{design and}} implementation of a computer augmented environment that allows users to smoothly interchange digital information among their portable computers, table and wall displays, and other physical objects. Supported by a camera-based object recognition system, users can easily integrate their portable computers with the pre-installed ones in the environment. Users can use displays projected on tables and walls as a spatially continuous extension of their portable computers. Using an interaction technique called hyperdragging, users can transfer information from one computer to another, by only knowing the physical relationship between them. We also provide a mechanism for attaching digital data to physical objects, such as a videotape or a <b>document</b> <b>folder,</b> to link physical and digital spaces...|$|E

50|$|Windows XP {{introduces}} a more simplified form of sharing files with local users in a multi-user environment {{and over the}} network called Simple File Sharing. Simple File Sharing which is enabled by default for non-domain joined computers, disables the separate Security tab used to set advanced ACLs/permissions and enables a common interface for both - permissions on file system folders and sharing them. With Simple File Sharing enabled, the My <b>Documents</b> <b>folder</b> or its subfolders can only be read and written to by its Owner and by local Administrators. It is not shared on the network. By checking the Make this folder private option in its Properties, local Administrators are also denied permissions to the My <b>Documents</b> <b>folder.</b> For sharing files with other user accounts on the same computer when Simple File Sharing is enabled, Windows XP includes the Shared <b>Documents</b> <b>folder.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Documents</b> <b>folders</b> are {{for storage}} {{and can be}} made {{accessible}} to members or just administrators but not non-members. In adding a file to a <b>documents</b> <b>folder</b> this contributes to the member's storage limit. A photo album can also be created for storing photos and images for the site. These images can be put on a custom web page and on the message boards. Adding images also contributes to the storage limit. Uploading images and documents requires the ActiveX control to be installed. The storage limit is 3 MB across all groups and can be upgraded to 30 MB if the person upgrades to MSN Hotmail Plus (fee). However, on MSN Spaces an unlimited amount of images can be added without the need of paying. So, images can be hotlinked as {{they are on the}} MSN domain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} DocMan, {{an interactive}} {{document management system}} which supports cooperative preparation, exchange, and distribution of <b>documents.</b> <b>Document</b> <b>folders</b> are shared among people, allowing for collaboration {{on the basis of}} a common information space. Access to <b>document</b> <b>folders</b> is provided transparently. Each folder contains a set of document revisions and a set of drafts currently in preparation. Metainformation concerning what is going on with folders, revisions, drafts, and users is distributed. DocMan's revision concept is based on a soft-locking scheme, avoiding both loss of work done simultaneously and access restrictions, thereby allowing users to work mobilly while being periodically disconnected from any network. 1.

50|$|Encrypting File System (EFS) in Windows Vista {{can be used}} {{to encrypt}} the system page file and the per-user Offline Files cache. EFS is also more tightly {{integrated}} with enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and supports using PKI-based key recovery, data recovery through EFS recovery certificates, or a combination of the two. There are also new Group Policies to require smart cards for EFS, enforce page file encryption, stipulate minimum key lengths for EFS, enforce encryption of the user’s <b>Documents</b> <b>folder,</b> and prohibit self-signed certificates. The EFS encryption key cache can be cleared when a user locks his workstation or after a certain time limit.|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally, the Start menu {{provided}} a customizable nested list {{of programs for}} the user to launch, {{as well as a}} list of most recently opened documents, a way to find files and get help, and access to the system settings. Later enhancements via Windows Desktop Update included access to special folders like [...] "My Documents" [...] and [...] "Favorites" [...] (browser bookmarks). Windows XP's Start menu was expanded to encompass various My <b>Documents</b> <b>folders</b> (including My Music and My Pictures), and transplanted other items like My Computer and My Network Places from the Windows desktop. Until Windows Vista, the Start menu was constantly expanded across the screen as the user navigated through its cascading sub-menus.|$|R

Prior computers were not tailored to the office and what Smith called [...] "knowledge workers". He made a distinction between how these knowledge workers and secretaries - who were the common computer users at the time - wanted to use a computer. To introduce a computer that knowledge workers could easily understand and interact with, Smith believed it was imperative to incorporate objects and ideas they were already familiar with. This led him to represent common office items, such as <b>documents,</b> <b>folders,</b> file cabinets, and wastebaskets, in his icon designs for the Star.|$|R

40|$|Despite its shaping {{influence}} on the interactive structures of desktop computing, humancentered design {{has yet to be}} seriously applied to the filesystem. GNOME Storage is an evolving design and implementation for a document store that addresses many problems stemming from traditional filesystems. Some of the problems are: <b>document</b> <b>folders</b> are overflowing with hundreds of files, there's a strong separation on desktop computers between desktop and application, there's a strong separation between local and remote resources, most applications do not support real-time collaboration using multiple computers, localizing basic filesystem structures is very hard, and applications use a save-buffer model rather than presenting documents as concrete objects. We discuss these as design goals and how they are solved in the Storage implementation, in addition to providing a theoretical framework for understanding the filesystem's role...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{research}} project EPOS 1 we build a pro-active, contextsensitive support system {{to aid the}} user with his knowledge work, which is mostly about searching, reading, creating, and archiving of documents. In order to avoid distracting the user, the context gathering is realized by installable user observation plugins for standard applications such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. The main part {{of this paper is}} about the definition of a context model for the personal knowledge management domain. The context model incorporates only contextual elements relevant to satisfy the knowledge worker’s potential information need. It stores only information items known to the user (such as links to his own <b>documents,</b> <b>folders,</b> etc.), as well as, shared ontologies to assure an understanding of the context. The context is modeled in RDF/S and can be retrieved by context-aware applications from the context support system via an XML-RPC call. ...|$|R
