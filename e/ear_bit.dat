40|$|Groups of pigs were {{observed}} from weaning to marketing for {{the incidence of}} tail and/or ear biting and persistent inguinal nose thrusting. The 16 groups included single and mixed litters, single or mixed-sex ratios, and comprised up to 12 pigs; 14 of the groups showed biting behaviour and 12 groups showed persistent inguinal nose thrusting behaviour. The onset of biting appeared from 0 to 44 days after weaning, and persistent inguinal nose thrusting was first observed 4 to 22 days after weaning. There was {{a significant relationship between}} the number of pigs biting and being bitten in a group. The high ranks tend to bite middle and low ranks more than expected, the middle ranks bite other middle ranks more than expected, and low ranks bite the least. Within any rank {{there was no difference between}} male and females biting or being bitten. The most common situation was to have, in a group, some pigs which only tail bit, others that only <b>ear</b> <b>bit,</b> and others which both tail and <b>ear</b> <b>bit.</b> It is suggested that biting is a learned response spread by visual communication, so that visual barriers around affected groups may help to limit the spread of an outbreak. In persistent inguinal nose thrusting behaviour, rank was important, as the top ranking pigs were the most most likely to show persistent inguinal nose thrusting. Persistent inguinal nose thrusting may have its origin in udder seeking, exploratory or rooting behaviour, but becomes used mainly by dominant pigs. The behaviour is halted by the pig which received the nose thrusts moving away...|$|E

60|$|The poor {{creature}} {{never moved}} a step; she only crouched low before her own door {{and began to}} shiver violently. Kagax ran up to her; raised himself on his hind legs so as to place his fore paws on her neck; chose his favorite spot behind the <b>ears,</b> and <b>bit.</b> The hare straightened out, the quivering ceased. A tiny drop of blood followed the sharp teeth on either side. Kagax licked it greedily and hurried away, afraid to spoil his hunt by drinking.|$|R

60|$|When Prince Jollikin's head stopped rolling, {{he opened}} his eyes and looked about him, but could see no one; for the people and the Gigaboo had now gone. So, being unable to move, he decided to lie quiet for a time, and this was not a {{pleasant}} thing for an active young man like the Prince to do. To be sure, he could wiggle his <b>ears</b> a <b>bit,</b> and wink his eyes; but that was the extent of his powers. After a few minutes, because he had a cheerful disposition and wished to keep himself amused, he began to whistle a popular song; and then, becoming interested in the tune, he whistled it over again with variations.|$|R

When the final skin had been removed he rose. Now he heard Sabor in the bushes to his rear, but not yet too close. Leisurely he {{gathered}} up the six pelts and one of the carcasses, and as the lioness appeared between the boles of two trees he swung upward into the branches above him. Here he hung the hides over a limb, seated himself comfortably upon another with his back against the bole of the tree, cut a hind quarter from the carcass he had carried with him and proceeded to satisfy his hunger. Sabor slunk, growling, from the brush, cast a wary eye upward toward the ape-man and then fell upon the nearest carcass.|$|R
6000|$|Just at {{that moment}} a rabbit sprang from under a bush and darted away before them. In an instant Harry Somerville gave a wild shout, and set off in pursuit. Whether it was the cry or the sudden flight of Harry's horse we cannot tell, but the next instant Kate's charger {{performed}} an indescribable flourish with its hind legs, laid back its <b>ears,</b> took the <b>bit</b> between its teeth, and ran away. Jacques was on its heels instantly, and a few seconds afterwards Charley and Harry joined in the pursuit, but their utmost efforts failed {{to do more than}} enable them to keep their ground. Kate's horse was making for a dense thicket, into which it became evident they must certainly plunge. Harry and her brother trembled when they looked at it and realised her danger; even Jacques's face showed some symptoms of perturbation for a moment as he glanced before him in indecision.

40|$|Poincaré famously {{compared}} the logician’s understanding of mathematics {{to the understanding}} we would have of chess if we were only to know its rules. ”To understand the game, ” Poincaré wrote, ”is wholly another matter; it is {{to know why the}} player moves this piece rather than that other which he could have moved without breaking the rules of the game. It is to perceive the inward reason which makes of this series of moves a sort of organized whole. ” [P, pp. 217 - 218] The Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer took a position similar to Poincaré’s: genuinely mathematical reasoning is {{not simply a matter of}} logical inference. It is, as Poincaré put it, a matter of mathematical insight. Despite those views concerning logic, Poincaré and Brouwer believed that the foundations of mathematics ought to be studied, and indeed carried out fundamental work in this area. This might strike contemporary <b>ears</b> as a <b>bit</b> odd, but it is a consistent view. Mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics are frequently lumped together, as though they are the same...|$|R
60|$|Speaking of Marcus Aurelius and the golfing {{temperament}} recalls to my {{mind the}} case of young Mitchell Holmes. Mitchell, when I knew him first, was a promising {{young man with a}} future before him in the Paterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which my old friend, Alexander Paterson, was the president. He had many engaging qualities--among them an unquestioned ability to imitate a bulldog quarrelling with a Pekingese in a way which had to be heard to be believed. It was a gift which made him much in demand at social gatherings in the neighbourhood, marking him off from other young men who could only almost play the mandolin or recite bits of Gunga Din; and no doubt it was this talent of his which first sowed the seeds of love in the heart of Millicent Boyd. Women are essentially hero-worshippers, and when a warm-hearted girl like Millicent has heard a personable young man imitating a bulldog and a Pekingese to the applause of a crowded drawing-room, and has been able to detect the exact point at which the Pekingese leaves off and the bulldog begins, she can never feel quite the same to other men. In short, Mitchell and Millicent were engaged, and were only waiting to be married till the former could bite the Dyeing and Refining Company's <b>ear</b> for a <b>bit</b> of extra salary.|$|R

40|$|Local {{administration}} of recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI), the physiologic inhibitor {{of the tissue}} factor-factor Vila complex that also inhibits factor Xa, attenuates necrosis after reperfusion of ischemic <b>ears</b> in rab <b>bits.</b> To determine whether rTFPl limits myocardial reperfusion injury, either rTFPI(100 μg/kg/min, n= 7), heparin (bolus: 150 U/kg; infusion: 50 U/kg/hr, n= 4) or arginine-phosphate vehicle (n= 7) were administered intravenously to conscious dogs beginning 15 min before and for 60 min after release from a 2 hr balloon occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Reperfusion was maintained as verified with a proximal Doppler probe. Animals given rTFPI exhibited increases in PT (21 ± 7 (SD) sec, n= 7, P< 0. 01 compared with baseline) but no increase in aPTI, whereas those given heparin exhibited marked increases in aPTI (72 ± 9 sec, n= 3, P< 0. 01). Two days after reperfusion, the coronary artery was reoccluded, the heart was perfused with Lissamine green to delineate the area at risk, and infarcted areas were demarcated by incubation of LV sections in 2, 3, 5 triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TIC). Risk and infarcted areas were quantified by computerized planimetry. Risk area was similar among groups (28 ± 7 % of LV in rTFPl, 31 ± 5 % in heparin, 30 ± 3 % in vehicle), but infarct area expressed {{as a percentage of}} the area at risk decreased significantly in dogs which received rTFPI (17 ± 16 %) compared with either heparin (39 ± 23 %, p= 0. 09), or vehicle (39 ± 21 %, P= 0. 04). Thus, rTFPI appears to limit myocardial reperfusion injury and may do so either by more efficient anticoagulation or by a mechanism other than inhibition of prothrombin activation...|$|R
2500|$|Giving {{it three}} out of five stars, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized Damita Jo saying it {{featured}} [...] "a slew of the gooey, structureless sex ballads that have become Janet's staple." [...] Cinquemani also called the songs [...] "Like You Don't Love Me" [...] and [...] "Moist" [...] "two of the album's best." [...] Entertainment Weekly rated it a 'C+' saying [...] "The tracks, many produced by her longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, have the sumptuous, homogenized creaminess we've come to expect from her." [...] Angus Batey of Yahoo! Music UK gave it four out of ten stars, saying [...] "Numerous explanatory spoken word asides seek to reassure us that Janet, as she approaches 40, is seeking love rather than reveling in lust." [...] However, she called [...] "R Junkie" [...] "a delicious throwback, like a glorious 'Rhythm Nation'", [...] "I Want You" [...] "a peculiar post-modern waltz with a '40s supper club vibe, being the ear-catcher", and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] "another precision-tooled winner, with Jackson using an almost ethereal higher-pitched vocal delivery." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, saying Damita Jo [...] "smacks of trying too hard. [...] {{the truth is that}} Jackson is just trying to humanize herself, as she did so well on her breakthrough 1986 album, Control [...] Jackson has had eighteen years of monster hits, so it's hard to fault her instincts. [...] but there's too much of Jackson's moistness to wade through to get to Damita Jo's solid ground." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music -- as with anything, it all depends on the artist. [...] Damita Jo proves that she was merely flirting with modesty, since it's as explicit as pop music gets." [...] Ian Wade of BBC Music had mixed feelings, saying that [...] "While there's nothing outwardly bad about Damita Jo, at 22 tracks over 65 minutes, your attention does start to wander and you almost forget it's playing. But after a third or fourth listen, the slick grooves of [...] "Spending Time With You" [...] and [...] "Island Life" [...] gain more identity. [...] Damita Jo heralds no real major leap forward, but it's no pig's <b>ear</b> either. A <b>bit</b> of editing and a couple of killer dance tracks would've made it even better." ...|$|R
