5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, <b>Dianthus</b> gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.|$|E
5|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna. The {{calcareous}} grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while the scrub towards {{the west of the}} site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). Less common plants include the cheddar pink (<b>Dianthus</b> gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana).|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium <b>dianthus,</b> fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as <b>Dianthus</b> deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest {{in this area is}} progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of the}} Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E

25|$|About 1,300 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants {{grow in the}} park, of which 37 are endemic to the Tatras, 41 are endemic to the Western Carpathians and 57 are endemic to the Carpathians. Notable plants endemic to the Tatras include Tatra scurvy-grass (Cochlearia tatrae), yellow mountain saxifrage (Saxifraga aizoides), Erysimum wahlenbergii of the wallflower genus, Cochlearia tatrae, Erigeron hungaricus of the Erigeron genus, and others. Ice age relicts include Ranunculus alpestris of the Ranunculus genus, glacier crowfoot, <b>Dianthus</b> glacialis of the <b>Dianthus</b> genus, Gentiana frigida of the gentian genus, Primula minim of the Primula genus, yellow mountain saxifrage, dwarf willow, net-leaved willow (Salix reticulata), and others.|$|E
500|$|... {{grassland}} {{communities and}} two of the woodland types have a restricted distribution in Britain, as does the calcareous grassland/acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. These support species, four of which are considered nationally rare while seven of the plant species present are considered notable. Plants of interest include the nationally rare Cheddar pink (<b>Dianthus</b> gratianopolitanus), bedstraw (Galium fleurotii), dwarf sedge (Carex humilis) and dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum). Rose Wood and King's Wood are ancient woodland sites. King's Wood has coppiced hazel and nationally important small leaved lime. The nationally rare purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum) occurs at Rose Wood.|$|E
500|$|The dry {{stone walls}} that divide the pasture into fields are a {{well-known}} {{feature of the}} Mendips. Constructed from local limestone in an [...] "Aframe" [...] design, the walls are strong yet contain no mortar; many have been neglected and allowed to disintegrate, or have been replaced or contained by a mix of barbed wire and sheep fencing. These dry-stone walls are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis). Amongst the plants which occur {{in the area are}} the Cheddar pink (<b>Dianthus</b> gratianopolitanus), purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), Somerset hair-grass (Koeleria vallesiana), and starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata).|$|E
500|$|In major {{conformation}} shows, {{the breed}} has been equally successful {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time as a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at the age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised independently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was reregistered as a West Highland White Terrier. The first win at a major show came at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1942 when Constance Winant's Ch. Wolvey Pattern of Edgerstoune won the title of Best in Show. The same title was taken by Barbara Worcester's Ch. Elfinbrook Simon in 1962. It took a further 14 years before the breed took its first Best in Show title at Crufts, the UK's major dog show. Ch. <b>Dianthus</b> Buttons, owned by Kath Newstead and Dorothy Taylor, took the title for the breed in 1976. A Westie also won Crufts in 1990 with the Best in Show title going to Derek Tattersall's Ch. Olac Moon Pilot., and in 2016.(Burneze Geordie Girl) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Amrum {{forest was}} mainly planted in 1948 on {{an area of}} heath. Until then only a few forested regions could be found around the decoy ponds. With 180 hectares, Amrum has the largest ratio of forested land of all Germany's North Sea islands. Mainly pines, firs and birches can be found here. Meanwhile, the forest has largely lost its {{artificial}} nature. So one will encounter numerous plants on all levels and many species of fungi. The [...] "geestland", east of the forest, is mostly used for farming. Its grassland grows plants such as Harebell (Campanula rotundifolia), Sea Thrift (Armeria maritima) and Carthusian Pink (<b>Dianthus</b> carthusianorum) and several species of hawkweed.|$|E

60|$|This table {{includes}} thirty-three cases {{relating to}} twenty-three species, and shows {{the degree of}} innate fertility of plants of crossed parentage in comparison with those of self-fertilised parentage; both lots being fertilised in the same manner. With several of the species, as with Eschscholtzia, Reseda, Viola, <b>Dianthus,</b> Petunia, and Primula, both lots were certainly cross-fertilised by insects, and so it probably was with several of the others; but {{in some of the}} species, as with Nemophila, and in some of the trials with Ipomoea and <b>Dianthus,</b> the plants were covered up, and both lots were spontaneously self-fertilised. This also was necessarily the case with the capsules produced by the cleistogene flowers of Vandellia.|$|E
60|$|Cases of an {{opposite}} nature likewise occur, namely, plants {{with the female}} organs struck with sterility, whilst the male organs remain perfect. <b>Dianthus</b> japonicus, a Passiflora, and Nicotiana, have been described by Gartner (18/89. 'Bastarderzengung' s. 356.) as being in this unusual condition.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Dianthus</b> caryophyllus--offspring {{of plants}} self-fertilised for three generations and then crossed by a fresh stock, {{compared}} with the offspring of plants self-fertilised for three generations and then crossed by plants of the third intercrossed generation, in fertility: [...] .. : [...] .. : [...] .. : [...] .. : 45.|$|E
60|$|Although at {{the time}} of {{measurement}} the plants raised from the cross with the fresh stock did not exceed in height or weight the intercrossed plants of the old stock (owing to the growth of the former not having been completed, as explained under the head of this species), yet they exceeded the intercrossed plants in fertility in the ratio of 100 to 54. This fact is interesting, as it shows that plants self-fertilised for four generations and then crossed by a fresh stock, yielded seedlings which were nearly twice as fertile as those from plants of the same stock which had been intercrossed for the five previous generations. We here see, as with Eschscholtzia and <b>Dianthus,</b> that the mere act of crossing, independently {{of the state of the}} crossed plants, has little efficacy in giving increased fertility to the offspring. The same conclusion holds good, as we have already seen, in the analogous cases of Ipomoea, Mimulus, and <b>Dianthus,</b> with respect to height.|$|E
6000|$|These {{two species}} (Mesembryanthemum and Crassicornis) are quite {{beautiful}} {{enough to give}} a beginner amusement: {{but there are two}} others which are not uncommon, and of such exceeding loveliness, that it is worth while to take a little trouble to get them. The one is <b>Dianthus,</b> which I have already mentioned; the other Bellis, the sea-daisy, of which there is an excellent description and plates in Mr. Gosse's [...] "Rambles in Devon," [...] pp. 24 to 32.|$|E
60|$|My {{attention}} was now thoroughly aroused, for I could hardly {{doubt that the}} difference between the two beds was due to the one set being the offspring of crossed, and the other of self-fertilised flowers. Accordingly I selected almost by hazard two other plants, which happened to be in flower in the greenhouse, namely, Mimulus luteus and Ipomoea purpurea, both of which, unlike the Linaria and <b>Dianthus,</b> are highly self-fertile if insects are excluded. Some flowers on a single plant of both species were fertilised with their own pollen, and others were crossed with pollen from a distinct individual; both plants being protected by a net from insects. The crossed and self-fertilised seeds thus produced were sown on opposite sides of the same pots, and treated in all respects alike; and the plants when fully grown were measured and compared. With both species, as in the cases of the Linaria and <b>Dianthus,</b> the crossed seedlings were conspicuously superior in height and in other ways to the self-fertilised. I therefore determined to begin a long series of experiments with various plants, and these were continued for the following eleven years; and we shall see that in a large majority of cases the crossed beat the self-fertilised plants. Several of the exceptional cases, moreover, in which the crossed plants were not victorious, can be explained.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. Bright red {{flowers are}} very {{attractive}} to butterflies, and are sometimes specially adapted to be fertilised by them, {{as in many}} pinks (<b>Dianthus</b> deltoides, D. superbus, D. atrorubens), the corn-cockle (Lychnis Githago), and many others. Blue flowers are especially attractive to bees and other hymenoptera (though they frequent flowers of all colours), no less than sixty-seven species of this order having been observed to visit the common [...] "sheep's-bit" [...] (Jasione montana). Dull yellow or brownish flowers, some of which smell like carrion, are attractive to flies, as the Arum and Aristolochia; while the dull purplish flowers of the Scrophularia are specially attractive to wasps.|$|E
