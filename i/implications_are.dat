Decomposition of fuzzy relation equations (I) based on Boolean-type <b>implications</b> <b>is</b> presented in a finite case. The solution existence of fuzzy relation equations (I) based on Boolean-type <b>implications</b> <b>is</b> studied, and for nice Boolean-type implications, some new solvability criteria based upon the notion of “solution matrices” are discussed. The complete solution set of fuzzy relation equation (1) based on Boolean-type <b>implication</b> can <b>be</b> determined by the maximal solution set of this equation, which is finite. An effective method to solve fuzzy relation equations (I) based on Boolean-type <b>implications</b> <b>is</b> proposed...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its <b>implications</b> <b>are,</b> has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E
25|$|Around 1450 BC, Minoan culture {{reached a}} turning point due to a natural {{catastrophe}} (possibly an earthquake).

Several important palaces, in locations such as Mallia, Tylissos, Phaistos and Hagia Triada, and the living quarters of Knossos were destroyed. The palace in Knossos seems to have remained largely intact, resulting in its dynasty's ability to spread its influence over large parts of Crete until it was overrun by the Mycenaean Greeks.|$|E
40|$|AbstractClause implication, A⇒B of two clauses A and B, {{is shown}} to be {{undecidable}} using the undecidability of finitely generated stable transitive relations on free terms. Clause <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> undecidable even in the case where A consists of four literals. The decision problem of clause <b>implication</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the decision problem of clause sets that consist of one clause and some ground units, hence the undecidability results hold also for these clause sets.

25|$|Mauling is an agonistic {{interaction}} that {{is often}} seen among workers in yellow jacket colonies. The mauler bites the dorsum of the thorax and gaster of the maulee. Ninety-seven percent of maulings last for 10 seconds or less, but some observed maulings were as long as 4 minutes. These interactions are mostly seen amongst older workers and occur throughout colony decline and up until total colony termination. These interactions between workers usually involve only one mauler at a time, but that same mauler often attacks multiple other workers that are nearby. These behaviors and their <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> still not fully understood by scientists.|$|E
25|$|Rheobase is {{influenced}} by excitability of the nodal membrane, which increases with hyperpolarization and decreases with depolarization. Its voltage-dependence follows the behavior of persistent sodium channels that are active near threshold and have rapidly activating, slowly inactivating channel properties. Depolarization increases the Na+ current through the persistent channels, resulting in a lower rheobase; hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. The strength-duration time constant increases with demyelination, as the exposed membrane is enlarged by inclusion of paranodal and internodal membrane. The function of the latter of these is to maintain resting membrane potential, so internodal dysfunction significantly affects excitability in a diseased nerve. Such <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> further discussed in Clinical Significance.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion that}} Rognvald could {{hand over his}} Northern Isles estates to his brother has been {{interpreted}} in various ways. For example, {{it may be that}} he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing. This is also {{one of a number of}} instances in which the writer of the Orkneyinga saga attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald's transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald's holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be rooted in the writer's interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.|$|E

Steve Morse of The Boston Globe noted the [...] "bell-like tones from the Edge fram a search for heaven" [...] and along with the {{subsequent}} track on the album, [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", these songs showed how the group were [...] "pilgrims still on a quest; not preachers who claim to have found answers". The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments, saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest. Rolling Stone called it [...] "assertive rock" [...] in their review of The Joshua Tree. The San Diego Union-Tribune said of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", [...] "the music charges, like someone fleeing for life". The Washington Post said the track is [...] "a bit oblique lyrically, but the <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> clear in Bono's resolute delivery, Dave (the Edge) Evan's quavering guitar, Adam Clayton's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen's rolling thunder drums".|$|E

500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their presence here was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. The <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> obvious: If we bring enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.) But he also notes that [...] "if Joshua Prawer were alive today he would no doubt deny any linkage between his Zionist political beliefs and the model of segregation that he developed." ...|$|E
