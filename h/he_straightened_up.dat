All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Gilbert went to {{the sofa}} and bent over {{him for a few}} moments. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Just then Aleck came in sight. As he saw {{the couple}} {{through the open door}} <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> to {{his full}} height. A look of inflinchable unflexibility flickered over his features.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me he gave a little start of surprise; <b>he</b> {{certainly}} <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> {{and looked at me}} hard.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up,</b> {{patted his}} hair, and resumed his peregrination. Damn the Roman Forum; he hated those dreary photographs.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> so {{abruptly}} as to alarm Selim, who sprang {{back the}} length of his bridle rein and snorted.|$|E
60|$|The Belgian seemed {{pleased with}} these {{expressions}} of sympathy. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up,</b> threw out {{his chest and}} bowed very low.|$|E
60|$|Dale stooped now, {{studying}} the grass, and holding Pedro. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> with a flash in his gray eyes.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{asked the}} question, as <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> {{and took a}} long look over to where the mist had temporarily lifted.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up,</b> {{taking his}} arm off her shoulder, and confronted Almayer, {{who looked at}} them both with an {{expression}} of concentrated fury.|$|R
60|$|But when Theseus {{heard the}} story, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up,</b> {{so that he}} seemed taller than ever before; and as for his face it was indignant, despiteful, bold, tender, and compassionate, all in one look.|$|R
60|$|This cowboy {{bent his}} head and kissed her hands and wrung them, and when <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> he was crying.|$|E
60|$|And when no specks at {{all were}} found in several pans, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and favored the {{hillside}} with a confident glance.|$|E
60|$|Neale {{took one}} more {{look at the}} rugged front of the cliff. When <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> the ruddy bronze had left his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's curious," [...] Whitney persisted, [...] "because if the fellow's nerve {{had given}} way {{he would have gone}} over the {{motorcycle}} and into the gate. Anyhow, he didn't lose control, because <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> her <b>up</b> the moment Andrew threw you back." ...|$|R
40|$|Sheriff Akinleye bends {{low over}} a {{customer}} in the barbershop, his eyes intently following the movements {{on a little}} dial, and a stethoscope in his ears. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> <b>up.</b> "All right. I get 136 over 82. Which is a little high. Normal is less than 120 over 80. You have prehypertension," he tells Phillip Griffin, 42, who has heard this before - though perhaps not in this much detail. The 26 -year-old medical student explains how high blood pressure works, each organ that it affects, its links to exercise, fried food, salt. Griffin {{says he plans to}} lose weight...|$|R
6000|$|Burton Ellis's handsome, boyish {{face flushed}} darkly crimson {{to the roots}} of his curly black hair. Something in the father's tone roused anger and {{rebellion}} in the son. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> from the turnip row he was hoeing, looked his father squarely in the face, and said quietly, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a species}} of crawfish," [...] he observed, meditatively. Then, seeing the girls approach, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and rather awkwardly lifted his hat.|$|E
60|$|Bostil stood amazed. The red {{stallion}} made short plunges. Slone reached low for the tripping reins. When <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> in {{the saddle}} Wildfire broke wildly into a run.|$|E
6000|$|At nightfall <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up.</b> The {{small of}} his back was stiff from stooping toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Charles Gould walked rapidly {{round the}} table, and, seizing her hands, bent down, {{pressing}} {{them both to}} his lips. Before <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> again to his full height she had disengaged one to smooth his cheek with a light touch, {{as if he were}} a little boy.|$|R
50|$|Facifica had {{completely}} <b>straighten</b> <b>up</b> and had 3 sons with Pilar. Two {{of the sons}} were Dolphy’s real sons Eric Quizon and Rolly Quizon. The comic relief would be Rodrigo (Roderick Paulate), Facifica’s gay son that <b>he</b> tries to <b>straighten</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{feel very}} bad {{if the old}} woman served me in the same way," [...] Master Plummer said, with a long-drawn sigh, as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> in the wooden chair. [...] "I'd rather lay right {{down on the floor}} an' go to sleep than do {{anything}} else I know of." ...|$|R
60|$|Gys {{leaned down}} and put his ear {{to the heart of}} the patient. For two minutes he {{remained}} motionless. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> and a smile spread over his disfigured features.|$|E
6000|$|He talked {{less and}} less, and the {{discussion}} of the sun-perishers died of mutual agreement as to its facts. Finally, glancing at his watch, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up,</b> yawned, stretched his arms and announced: ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> {{the voice}} from the wall went on, [...] "I'm sorry to step it up so quickly, but {{we are still in}} danger. Another few moments and we'll be free." ...|$|E
60|$|But if {{he thought}} but little of his visitor's {{appearance}} at first, he soon changed his sentiments toward him, for Tom had not spoken twenty words when Mr. Chillingsworth's whole aspect changed. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> in his seat, laid aside his pipe, pushed away his glass of Madeira, and bade Tom take a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Very good. Snip me a {{bit from}} the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. Part wool--foreign make. Very well. A snip from some garment of the child's, please. Thanks. Cotton. Shows wear. An {{excellent}} clue, excellent. Pass me a pallet of the floor dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! Now we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, he's got all the clues he wants now; he don't need anything more. Now, then, what does this Extraordinary Man do? He lays those snips and that dirt {{out on the table}} and leans over them on his elbows, and puts them together side by side and studies them--mumbles to himself, 'Female'; changes them around--mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes them this way and that--again mumbles: 'Five teeth--one a-coming--Catholic--yarn--cotton--kip--damn that kip.' Then <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> <b>up</b> and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands through his hair--plows and plows, muttering, 'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, and begins to tally off his clues on his fingers--and gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a minute--then his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire, and <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> <b>up</b> stately and majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a couple of you, and go down to Injun Billy's and fetch the child--the rest of you go 'long home to bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And he bows like the Matterhorn, and pulls out for the tavern. That's his style, and the Only--scientific, intellectual--all over in fifteen minutes--no poking around all over the sage-brush range {{an hour and a half}} in a mass-meeting crowd for him, boys--you hear me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{that was}} some stop, believe me!" [...] was Phil's grim comment, as <b>he</b> managed to <b>straighten</b> <b>up</b> and look ahead. [...] "Stuffed mackerel! what did we try to do, Dave--climb a tree?" ...|$|R
60|$|Roberts {{took the}} pack off his horse, {{and then the}} saddle. And he was bending over {{in the act of}} {{loosening}} the cinches of Joan's saddle when suddenly <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> with a jerk.|$|E
6000|$|... "He came up {{and looked}} at the pumpkin-glory, and he bent back and he bent forward, and he doubled down and <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up,</b> and laughed till the boys {{thought he was going to}} kill himself.|$|E
6000|$|Blome was genial, gay, and {{he talked}} the most. Wright alone seemed uncommunicative and unsociable. He smoked {{fiercely}} and drank continually. All at once <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>up</b> as if listening. [...] "What's that?" [...] he called suddenly.|$|E
60|$|Reaching {{the first}} rise of ground, the youth felt {{compelled}} to rest and threw himself {{at the foot of}} a large tree with his musket across his knees, ready for use should he be surprised. Once or twice his eyes closed in spite of his efforts to keep them open. But <b>he</b> invariably <b>straightened</b> <b>up,</b> determined to keep awake at all hazards.|$|R
60|$|With obliging alacrity Babalatchi {{put some}} dry {{brushwood}} on the coals from a handy pile, keeping {{all the time}} a watchful eye on Willems. When <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up</b> his hand wandered almost involuntarily towards his left side to feel the handle of a kriss amongst the folds of his sarong, but he tried to look unconcerned under the angry stare.|$|R
6000|$|Adam bent himself double, {{and with}} an almost motherly {{tenderness}} stroked her bright red hair. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> himself <b>up,</b> spat modestly in the dust, and, with face still mottled by our recent experience, expressed the opinion {{that the man was}} [...] "one of them low blackguards--excusing plain English, miss--who'd steal your chickens out of the very saucepan." [...] As for the woman--words failed him.|$|R
