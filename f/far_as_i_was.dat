500|$|A {{month after}} resigning from the {{national}} scene, Southall returned to management with Hastings United. However just one year on he was sacked, with the Hastings chairman saying that [...] "there have recently been {{an increasing number of}} issues on which Neville and I have disagreed and it had {{got to the point where}} our working relationship had broken down, beyond the point of repair, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned".|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent {{resigned}} {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party on September 5, 1957, but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected. With a lame-duck leader, the Liberals were ineffective in opposition. Paul Martin stated that [...] "I'm sure I never thought the day would come when [...] would ever be a member of a government, let alone head of it. When that happened, the world had come to an end as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned." [...] In January 1958, St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert finally {{called on}} Sullivan {{and read the}} {{libretto}} to him on 20 February 1875. [...] Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, [...] " [...] read it through ...in {{the manner of a}} man considerably disappointed with what he had written. [...] As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious {{of the fact that he}} had achieved his purpose so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time." [...] Trial by Jury, described as [...] "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" [...] in the original promotional material, was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks.|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s and 50s, Unwin had {{developed}} [...] "Unwinese", a nonsense language that distorted {{words and phrases}} into a form of gibberish, that sounded unintelligible but which in fact retained some fragments of meaning. Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies. He elaborated, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him. It wasn't that the story called for someone who could speak gobbledegook, {{it was a question}} of how we could fit him into the storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Champions League final on 19 May 2012, Drogba {{scored the}} {{equaliser}} from Juan Mata's {{corner in the}} 88th minute, taking Chelsea into extra time and then penalties. He also scored the winning penalty in the 4–3 penalty shootout that led Chelsea to the victory over Bayern Munich. Sir Alex Ferguson remarked: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, he [...] won the Champions League for Chelsea." [...] Drogba's headed effort marked his ninth goal in nine cup final appearances for Chelsea, Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola spoke after the match about Drogba's ability in big games: [...] "In all their very important matches he has put a stamp on it." [...] In November 2012 Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea Magazine.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I." [...] He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.|$|E

500|$|Woo {{was also}} {{pressured}} by Universal to tone-down {{the violence and}} body count that they had seen in his Hong Kong films. As Woo had not mastered the English language yet, it took time for {{the cast and crew}} to get used to working with him. When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple statements such as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his message across to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not [...] "the most powerful person on the set but as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, he was certainly the most respected".|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated {{for at least}} a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes." [...] Ballard later concluded that [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E
500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino's musical score, {{writing that}} [...] "I'm {{reminded}} of the heights of emotion this series can evoke." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was [...] "not cool", but asked [...] "how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. [...] I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, {{a lot of it}} was set-up for … [...] ), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned." [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post [...] "really liked this episode" [...] and concluded that it [...] "definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series.

Discussing her 1993 appearance in Casualty, Winslet told the Radio Times: [...] "In England, it almost seems {{to be part of}} a jobbing actor's training [...] As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned it was a great episode, a great part.

We, as professionals, said it was just too bad that we lost the Belgrano". Captain Bonzo also told Middlebrook that he was not angry about the attack on his ship and [...] "The limit [...] did not exclude danger or risks; it was all the same in or out.
