5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{speculative}} fiction {{on television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.|$|E

5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> changed to improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water {{draining}} into the ground at swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|Filmed over {{a period}} of two months after nearly three years of research, The Mirror Never Lies was {{sponsored}} in part by the Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wakatobi regency government. The first feature film to star the Bajau, it used their language extensively. Although a commercial failure domestically, it has been screened at many international film festivals and won several awards both inside and outside of Indonesia. Critical reviews <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> positive, mostly emphasising the film's visuals.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{politics}} {{since the}} second half of the 20th century <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> dominated by the Democratic Party, and the state has a reputation for being the most liberal state in the country. In 1974, Elaine Noble became the first openly lesbian or gay candidate elected to a state legislature in US history. The state housed the first openly gay member of the United States House of Representatives, Gerry Studds, in 1972 and in 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Several {{regional}} university stadiums {{have been}} used by the team for Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup matches, including Klöckner Stadium in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1996, and George Mason Stadium in Fairfax, Virginia in 2010. Similarly, the team has also used the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, Maryland for multiple early-round games in U.S. Open Cup and CONCACAF Champions' Cup since it opened in 2001. Exhibition games, as well as occasional regular season matches, have also been played in nearby FedExField in Landover, Maryland; the latter <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> played as part of doubleheaders featuring friendlies between national teams or foreign clubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{evidence}} using DNA {{suggests the}} macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5million years ago. Although the two <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> considered separate species, the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, {{such as the}} Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.|$|E

5|$|No {{games in}} the series were {{released}} outside of Japan until two characters, Marth and Roy, were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, The Blazing Blade, in Western regions under the title Fire Emblem in 2003. Many {{games in the}} series have sold well, despite a decline during the 2000s {{which resulted in the}} series' near-cancellation. Individual entries <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> praised, and the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.|$|E
5|$|Since its launch, monthly sales {{numbers of}} the console <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> higher than its {{competitors}} around the globe. According to the NPD Group, the Wii sold more units in the United States than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined {{in the first half}} of 2007. This lead is even larger in the Japanese market, where it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console’s release. It also broke the 360’s Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The state's U.S. Senate seats <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> split {{since the}} early 1990s, and in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Minnesota's congressional {{delegation}} was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 midterm election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol Molnau narrowly won reelection. The DFL posted double-digit gains {{in both houses of}} the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide. In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host Al Franken beat incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast.|$|E
