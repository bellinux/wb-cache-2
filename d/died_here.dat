5|$|The {{church is}} {{dedicated}} to Saint Decuman who {{is thought to have}} <b>died</b> <b>here</b> around 706. An early church was built near Daw's Castle and a new church was erected in the 15th century. It has several tombs and monuments to Sir John Wyndham and his family who were the lords of the manor. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which was written in the area is commemorated by a statue on the harbourside.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{resident}} who migrated to Singapore was Yamamoto Otokichi in 1862 and who <b>died</b> <b>here</b> in 1867. His remains were later reburied at the Japanese Cemetery Park in Hougang. Uta Matsuda, {{the first female}} Japanese settler, ran a grocery shop with her Chinese husband in the 1860s. The Japanese introduced the Jinrickshaw to the local scene, a two-wheeled, passenger cart pulled by one person in 1894, which culminated {{in the building of}} the Jinricksha Station in early 1900s. They set up various Japanese shops and companies and the community increased substantially numbering 6,950 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, <b>died</b> <b>here.</b> It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|President Garfield {{was brought}} to Long Branch {{in the hope that}} the fresh air and quiet might aid his {{recovery}} after being shot on July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin's bullet lodged in his spine.

The Garfield Tea House, constructed from railroad ties that had been laid to carry Garfield's train, is in Elberon.|$|E
25|$|Esau {{was filled}} with hatred toward Jacob for taking away both his {{birthright}} and his blessing. He vowed to himself to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac <b>died.</b> <b>Here</b> again, Rebecca prophetically perceived his murderous intentions and ordered Jacob to travel to her brother Laban's house in Haran, until Esau's anger subsided. She then convinced Isaac to send Jacob away, by telling him that she despaired of him marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of Canaan (as Esau had done). After Isaac sent Jacob away to find a wife, Esau realized that his own Canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes, {{and he took a}} daughter of Isaac's half-brother Ishmael as another wife.|$|E
25|$|A Captain Smith was the {{purchaser}} of 'Glenriddell' and he in turn {{sold the}} estate on to Provost John Crichton of Sanquhar, brother of John Crichton, who purchased {{it on his}} behalf in 1809. The house and estate had therefore been purchased for Dr James Crichton (1765–1823), who had made his fortune with the East India Company in the trade with China and had lived at Canton. In 1812 he took up occupancy and changed {{the name of the}} property from Glenriddell back to Friars' Carse and <b>died</b> <b>here</b> in 1823. His widow (Elizabeth Grierson) remained at Friars' Carse until her own death in 1862. The Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries was founded by her with a bequest of £100,000 in her husband's memory, or in other accounts founded by Dr Crichton himself.|$|E

25|$|From 1812 {{until his}} death in 1833, Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth had his home at Bitton House, which was then called West Cliff House. Meanwhile, Thomas Luny, the painter of seascapes, lived in the town for thirty years {{until his death}} in 1837 and {{executed}} over 2,200 paintings while living here. Shortly afterwards George Hennet, the railway engineer and contractor who was closely involved with Brunel's railway, moved to the town and took a close interest in local affairs. He <b>died</b> <b>here</b> in 1857. Charles Babbage (1791–1871), the mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, who originated the idea of a programmable computer, also lived here for some years. Sir John Smyth, (1893–1983) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross and was made 1st Baronet of Teignmouth in 1956.|$|E
25|$|The road to Harold's Grange {{continues}} southward from Loreto Abbey, past {{some very}} old houses, {{which have been}} restored in recent years. The first is Snugborough, which has its gable end to the road. The next is Washington Lodge, its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In recent years new avenues have been laid out here {{on both sides of}} the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is Silveracre, once the home of Dr Henthorn Todd, Professor of Hebrew in T.C.D., who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He <b>died</b> <b>here</b> in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.|$|E
500|$|When the Chakraphat Phiman Hall {{was first}} built {{it was entirely}} roofed with palm leaves; later these were {{replaced}} with ceramic tiles, then with glazed tiles {{during the reign of}} King Rama V. There is a tradition that no uncrowned kings are allowed to sleep within this hall. However once they were crowned they were required to sleep there, if only for a few nights, literally on the bed of their forefathers. In 1910, [...] prior to his coronation, King Rama VI had a well-concealed modern toilet installed near the bedchamber. The king spent many nights here {{near the end of his}} life and <b>died</b> <b>here</b> in 1925. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) and King Rama IX only spent a few nights here after their respective coronations in accordance with tradition.|$|E
