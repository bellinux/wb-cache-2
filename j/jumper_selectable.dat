40|$|This paper {{presents}} the requirements {{and design of}} a Timing Synchronization System (TSS) for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) control system at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. A clock module has been designed which resides in a VME crate. The clock module can be a communications master or a slave depending on its configuration, which is software and <b>jumper</b> <b>selectable.</b> As a master, the clock module sends out messages {{in response to an}} external synchronization signal over a serial fiber optic line. As a slave, it receives the messages and interrupts an associated computer in its VME crate. The application that motivated the development of the TSS, the Accelerator 30 Hz Measurement System, will be described. Operational experience with the TSS will also be discussed.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present the {{requirements}} and design of the Timing Synchronization System for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility control system at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. A clock module {{has been designed to}} reside in a VME crate with a master front-end computer and communicate with the Data Acquisition VME crates and their front-end computers via a serial fiber optic line. Configuration of the clock modules is <b>jumper</b> and software <b>selectable.</b> The application that motivated the development of the Timing Synchronization System, the Accelerator 30 Hz System, will also be presented. This system needs less than 1 ms time differential between the data acquisitions on the various DAQ front-end computers in order to gather correlated information. The development of and our operational experience with this application using the new timing synchronization system will be discussed. *This work was supported by the U. S.
