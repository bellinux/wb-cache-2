5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E
5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his {{high level of}} production to date. Believed to be necessary {{in pursuit of a}} trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> out his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, where they were drawn with West Bromwich Albion. Roger Hunt gave Liverpool {{the lead in the}} match held at West Bromwich's home ground, The Hawthorns, in the 44th minute. They extended their lead in the 63rd minute when Ian St. John scored. West Bromwich were awarded a penalty in the 77th minute, after Liverpool defender Ron Yeats handled the ball, thinking the referee <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> for a free-kick. Cram missed the subsequent penalty, but West Bromwich scored three minutes later through Jeff Astle. However, they were unable to score a second and Liverpool won 2–1 to progress to the fourth round. Stockport County were the opposition in the fourth round. The match, at Anfield, finished 1–1, Gordon Milne equalised for Liverpool after Len White had given Stockport the lead in the 18th minute. Liverpool won the replay, at Edgeley Park, 2–0 courtesy of two goals from Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, {{also drew}} attention. Rivera and Lidge {{were the only}} closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason, whereas closers on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 postseason games before the World Series in 2009. Both had {{performed}} well during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were {{in stark contrast to}} the previous season (41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games). As a result, USA Today gave the Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> two saves against the Yankees during their regular season series earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the storm}} <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> down {{telegraph}} {{lines in the}} area, two riders immediately set off for Roberts, ten miles to the south, and sent messages into St. Paul with news of the tornado. Altogether, the tornado and the subsequent fires that raged throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along {{with more than half}} the residences in town, which combined added up to more than 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located {{on the banks of the}} Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by the tornado, the town's public school and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition— it was impossible to tell if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of August 22–23, the North Koreans {{launched}} a weak attack against the 27th Infantry, which was quickly repulsed. Just before 12:00 on August 23, however, a violent action occurred some distance behind the front line when about 100 North Korean soldiers, undetected, succeeded in reaching the positions of K Company, 27th Infantry and of the 1st Platoon, C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion. They overran parts of these positions before being driven off and suffering 50 killed. Meanwhile, as ordered by Walker, the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, after repelling several North Korean night attacks, counterattacked at dawn and seized the high ground overlooking the road at the artillery positions. At {{the same time the}} 3rd Battalion started an all-day attack that swept a stretch of high ground east of the road. This action largely cleared the North Koreans from the area behind and on the flanks of the 27th Infantry. At 13:35, Michaelis reported from the Bowling Alley to Eighth Army that the KPA 13th Division <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> the road to his front, had mined it, and was withdrawing.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
5|$|On 3/4 June 1942 MacLachlan {{infiltrated}} a {{group of}} Do 217s from KG 2 as they orbited in preparation for landing at Saint-André-sur-Orne. Within 14 seconds he had shot down two bombers and damaged two more (victories 12–13) before German defences were alerted and began returning fire. Flying with Kuttelwascher, they trailed a formation of 15 German bombers that had raided Poole. Sighting them over their own airfield he destroyed one and then was detected by searchlights. Taking evasive action he latched onto another and shot it down. A third and fourth were damaged. Kuttelwascher arrived and as MacLachlan left and claimed another He 111 and Do 217. MacLachlan saw two flashes on the ground denoting a crashed aircraft after he attacked. German records show two Do 217s shot down one crash-landed and one severely damaged. MacLachlan's first victim {{appears to have been}} Unteroffizier Gerhard Wagner's Wrk Nr. 5392 Do 217 from 3./KG 2. Wagner, Feldwebel Wilhelm Oberwohr, Unteroffizier Josef Maier and Oberfledwebel Anton Lamm were killed. Another II./KG 2 Do 217 crashed there while another was severely damaged. Another Do 217 fell 40 miles south of Cherbourg but this machine—Wrk nr. 5331 piloted by Feldwebel Hans Koch of 7./KG 2—was likely a victim of Kuttelwascher. All of the crew were killed in action. It was MacLachlan's last victory with the squadron. He flew five more intruder sorties during which he returned via Antwerp and Ostend at near-zero feet after his map <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> out the side-canopy window on 26 June and chased a Ju 88 45 miles south of Selsey Bill without result on 2 July.|$|E

25|$|Both teams {{faced each}} other in the 112th Big Game with seven wins each, the first time this had {{happened}} since 1991, with #17 Stanford favored over #25 Cal.

Cal also played its second game without star running back Jahvid Best, again starting backup Shane Vereen.|$|E
25|$|The town of Willow Bunch has had {{two other}} skating rinks before the current one. The current {{community}} skating rink was built in late 1957 {{on the east side}} of town. The arch rafters that were used to build the rink were scavenged from another skating rink in the nearby town of Assiniboia after a severe wind storm <b>had</b> <b>blown</b> it down. The dimensions of the rink are as follows: 1,043 feet wide x 180 feet long x 40 feet high. In 1959, a lobby was built onto the south end of the rink.|$|E
