5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square <b>head</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon socket <b>head</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw,</b> for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly."

50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} hex socket <b>head</b> <b>set</b> <b>screws,</b> and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style <b>set</b> <b>screw.</b> His safety <b>set</b> collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard.

5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the hex socket <b>head</b> <b>set</b> <b>screw,</b> Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a hex {{socket head cap screw}} (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment none of us had ever seen a socket head cap screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first socket head cap screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|R
5000|$|Headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had <b>headed</b> <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used <b>headed</b> <b>set</b> <b>screws,</b> holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, socket <b>head</b> <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force. The tightening tests were performed {{with the aid of a}} microprocessor controlled torque wrench and a torque-tension testing rig. Load cells fitted to the test rig provided an accurate measurement of the joint clamp load and the faster thread and underhead torque distribution under a range of lubrication conditions. Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield tightening, and during loosening. The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener. It was shown that the design of bolted joints must take account of the influence of friction if thejoints are to operate effectively in service. ...|$|R
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket <b>head,</b> beginning with <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R
50|$|The Schurter Group {{was founded}} in Lucerne in 1933 by Heinrich Schurter with funding from his mother and mother-in-law, {{during the time of}} the Great Depression. The company got its start {{producing}} fuse cartridges, <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> and <b>set</b> <b>screws.</b> Heinrich's son Rolf joined the company in the 1940s to help manage the accounting and bookkeeping. Fuseholders were added to the product line in 1944, and the company's first catalog was printed. During the 1940s Schurter products began to be listed in reseller's catalogs. The company moved to its current facilities established at Werkhofstrasse 8 in 1948. The company was transformed into a limited liability company in 1949. In 1964 the company had grown to 194 employees. By 1968, component sales amounted to two-thirds of Schurter's business due to increasing exports. Hienrich Schurter died that year. Schurter GmbH was established in Endingen, Germany in 1971 under Managing Director Kaspar Egli, who came from Lucerne to run the business.|$|R
50|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screw</b> collars {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the <b>set</b> <b>screw.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> causes damage to the shaft - a flare-up of shaft material - which makes the collar harder to adjust or remove. It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> locations to eliminate this problem.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the <b>set</b> <b>screw's</b> point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the <b>screw.</b> <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R

50|$|A <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used {{to secure}} an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> has a <b>head,</b> the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|R

50|$|Most {{household}} {{door handles}} use a simple mechanism with a screw-style axle (called a spindle) that {{has at least}} one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed {{on each side of the}} door to which the handles are attached. Some handles are attached on both sides by screwing or sliding them directly onto the spindle, and then securing one or more retaining <b>screws</b> (<b>set</b> <b>screws)</b> through the knob perpendicular to the flat of the spindle. Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the <b>set</b> <b>screw,</b> which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of <b>set</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
40|$|A simple {{depth gauge}} has been {{designed}} to ensure, easily and quickly, the proper length of screws in bone surgery. The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end. Upon this rod is mounted a sliding metal collar with a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> to fix it firmly to the rod at the desired place. This device has certain drawbacks, the most important of which is that the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be screwed in firmly or not at all. When the instrument has been passed through the screw hole, the bent end engaged in the opposite cortex, and the sliding collar pushed against the proximal cortex, the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> must be engaged firmly.

5000|$|For longer life, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{are usually}} made {{of alloy steel}} and case hardened. Hardened <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> often leave a plastic deformation, {{in the form of}} a {{circular}} or semicircular mark, in the shaft that the <b>screw</b> <b>sets</b> against. This has both pros and cons. On the pro side, such deformation increases the holding power (torque resistance) of the joint, as the screw is essentially [...] "making its own detent" [...] on a small but effective scale. On the con side, if one is aiming to have a blemish-free cosmetic finish on the part being set against, one must take actions to prevent the circular marks. In most <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> applications, this consideration is irrelevant. Another con is that this plastic deformation can cause corresponding high points in the shaft surrounding the circular mark. This can result in difficulties during dis-assembly if a bearing or other tightly toleranced part needs to slide past this area. Use of a flat mitigates this problem.|$|R
