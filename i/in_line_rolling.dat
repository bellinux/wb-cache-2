40|$|Inherent strain {{method has}} been widely used as a {{forecasting}} and computing method for welding deformation of large complicated structures and further applied to the research of line heating forming. Mechanical forming is a common ship-hull plate forming method, for which deformation prediction still depends mainly on elastoplastic finite element method. This paper researched the application of inherent strain method to plate <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> forming, a common mechanical forming method, and then compared the results of inherent strain method and elastoplastic finite element method, proving the applicability of inherent strain method, providing a method for fast, accurate forecasting of distortion <b>in</b> plate <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> and formation of automation equipment...|$|R
6000|$|As {{everything}} was ready this order was instantly obeyed, and the stripes of America were soon seen fluttering nearly in separate pieces. The two ships now ran {{a short distance}} <b>in</b> parallel <b>lines,</b> <b>rolling</b> from each other so heavily that the bright copper of the corvette was seen nearly to her keel. The Englishman, who seemed {{a portion of his}} ship, again tried his trumpet; the detached words of [...] "lie-by,"--"orders,"--"communicate," [...] were caught by one or two, but the howling of the gale rendered all connexion in the meaning impossible. The Englishman ceased his efforts to make himself heard, for the two ships were now rolling-to, and it appeared as if their spars would interlock. There was an instant when Mr. Leach had his hand on the main-brace to let it go; but the Foam started away on a sea, like a horse that feels the spur, and disobeying her helm, shot forward, as if about to cross the Montauk's forefoot.|$|R
50|$|The {{standardisation}} across lines {{was further}} reduced following privatisation in the 1990s when more {{attempts were made}} to replace the ageing Brugeoise and Siemens stocks with second hand purchases from Japan and the incorporation of the new Alstom Metropolis 100 Series rolling stock, none of which were purchased in enough numbers to make up the entirety of a line, let alone multiple lines on the network. Only in 2010s have there been moves towards re-standardising and modernising the fleet whilst retiring the ageing trains which had served since the opening of each respective line. Numerous purchases of new rolling stock have been made, along with the purchase of second hand rolling stock which the City Government claims is a necessity given the need to quickly incorporate trains <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> with <b>rolling</b> stock deficits.|$|R

There are very minor differences with the Roca Line trains, and the most major difference is the overhead collection which runs at a different voltage. The trains began to arrive in February 2014, just 13 months after the order was signed.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} to mid 1980s, the company built the Fiat-Materfer {{underground}} cars for use on the Buenos Aires Underground. The intention of these trainsets {{was to create a}} standardised fleet for the Underground network - which had a diverse range of rolling stock at the time - {{in order to reduce the}} maintenance costs associated with having many different models, and also to replace the ageing rolling stock of the network. Ultimately, only enough of these were built to service just Line E rather than the entire network. Nevertheless, they have served many years on the network and today they are used as temporary stand-ins <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> where newer <b>rolling</b> stock is arriving, and is thus being slowly phased-out of the network.|$|R

In 1960, with the deregulation of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks.

40|$|AbstractRoad tunnel {{ventilation}} system is of high non-linearity and uncertainty, and its exact mathematical model is acquired with very difficulty. In order to effectively control road tunnel {{ventilation system}}, a combined grey prediction fuzzy control (CGPFC) law is {{proposed in the}} paper. The output {{of this kind of}} combined controller is formed by combining outputs of the grey prediction fuzzy controller (GPFC) and the traditional fuzzy control law. The grey predictor is realized by discrete GM(1, 1) and it is used to predict the system outputs on <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>rolling</b> mode. The simulation and experiment for this new fuzzy control law to be applied in road tunnel ventilation system are conducted. The simulation and the practical application show that the effect of this method is better and it also cost less energy compared to the traditional fuzzy control method...|$|R

40|$|Local <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> forming is {{a common}} forming {{approach}} for the complex curvature plate of ships. However, the processing mode based on artificial experience is still applied at present, because {{it is difficult to}} integrally determine relational data for the forming shape, processing path, and process parameters used to drive automation equipment. Numerical simulation is currently the major approach for generating such complex relational data. Therefore, a highly precise and effective numerical computation method becomes crucial {{in the development of the}} automated local <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> forming system for producing complex curvature plates used in ships. In this study, a three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element method was first employed to perform numerical computations for local <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> forming, and the corresponding deformation and strain distribution features were acquired. In addition, according to the characteristics of strain distributions, a simplified deformation simulation method, based on the deformation obtained by applying strain was presented. Compared to the results of the three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element method, this simplified deformation simulation method was verified to provide high computational accuracy, and this could result in a substantial reduction in calculation time. Thus, the application of the simplified deformation simulation method was further explored in the case of multiple rolling loading paths. Moreover, it was also utilized to calculate the local <b>line</b> <b>rolling</b> forming for the typical complex curvature plate of ships. Research findings indicated that the simplified deformation simulation method was an effective tool for rapidly obtaining relationships between the forming shape, processing path, and process parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to re-investigate the long-run Japanese M 2 money demand {{function}} and its stability over the period of 1970 :Q 1 to 2010 :Q 4. This study uses the bounds testing approach to cointegration within the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework to examine the presence of a cointegration relationship. The rolling regression procedure is then incorporated into the ARDL cointegration test to investigate the stability of the cointegrating relationship between money demand and its determinants in Japan. With the full sample, this study confirms that real M 2 money demand, real income, real interest rates and real exchange rates are cointegrated. However, the evidence of the rolling ARDL cointegration test implies that the cointegrating relationships are not stable over time, indicating that the Japanese M 2 money demand function is also unstable. <b>In</b> <b>line</b> with the <b>rolling</b> ARDL cointegration results, the recursive Chow breakpoint F-test and the Quandt likelihood ratio (QLR) test also suggest the same instability outcome.
