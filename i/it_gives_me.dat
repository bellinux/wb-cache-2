25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the greatest satisfaction.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, {{a cousin}} of Till's, who said, [...] "I was hoping that one day she [...] would admit it, so it matters {{to me that she}} did, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> some satisfaction. It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, and a lot of black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for.

500|$|Carradine {{provided}} most of {{the financing}} for the project, which cost under 1 million dollars. He stated {{that the purpose of}} his other acting jobs was to pay for his independent projects, over which he would have artistic control. Carradine said he even sold his Kung Fu residuals to raise money for his own projects, and consequently gone into debt. [...] He also sought advice from directors he had worked with, including Martin Scorsese and Ingmar Bergman. [...] "The wonderful thing about working with good directors, Carradine admitted, is <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the opportunity to pick their brains for my own films." [...] Using his spare time to edit the film, in 1981, Carradine finally had a finished project to take to film festivals.|$|E
5000|$|According to the 9/11 Commission Report, {{after the}} plane's voice data {{recorder}} was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. [...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey! <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> to me." [...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush had given the order to shoot the plane down had it continued its path to Washington.|$|R

500|$|During a {{press release}} for the single and its {{accompanying}} remixes, Carey said the following regarding the re-recorded vocals: [...] "I’ve always {{had so much fun}} re-singing my songs for the club/dance mixes. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> the freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was more of what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|E
500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> a solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Kilmers' {{daughter}} Rose (1912–1917) was {{stricken with}} poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, {{they turned to}} their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Father James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Roman Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters Kilmer writes that he [...] "believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time," [...] and he [...] "wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith." [...] Kilmer would stop [...] "every morning for months" [...] on his way [...] "to the office and prayed for faith," [...] claiming that when [...] "faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think her tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> a selfish pleasure to write it down." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, del Potro won {{his third}} {{consecutive}} title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, {{which is a good}} thing for him, bad for the rest of us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E
500|$|A jubilant Thomas {{described}} the free kick {{as the most}} crucial goal of his career, and believed Wrexham had every chance of causing another upset in the next round, despite an unfavourable away draw: [...] "We are disappointed not {{to be at home}} but after beating the champions we're not afraid of anyone." [...] He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking: [...] "I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> energy, I feel stronger and believe in it." [...] His manager Flynn admitted Thomas [...] "trains when he wants to train," [...] and added: [...] "I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. And if he was 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for £5m." [...] Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E

500|$|Cuban saxophonist and {{clarinet}} player Paquito D'Rivera {{decided to}} record an album paying tribute to Brazilian music after being invited by several Brazilian performers {{to play their}} native music. D'Rivera also featured in Americanos: Latino Life in the United States, a 2000 documentary produced by American actor Edward James Olmos, representing Brazil. [...] "I feel a great passion for the culture and music of Brazil, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> pleasure to declare publicly that my heart is half Brazilian," [...] D'Rivera declared on his autobiography My Sax Life (2005). The album features the American group New York Voices since D'Rivera {{has always been an}} admirer of vocal quartets and wanted to [...] "kill two birds with one stone". He further explained that in Cuba [...] "musicians listened to radio stations from Miami mostly for the jingles sung by gringo vocal groups." [...] Brazilian Dreams was released by MCG Jazz on August 27, 2002 and was the tenth album recorded by the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, following A Nancy Wilson Christmas by Nancy Wilson, Joe Williams Presents: Nicole Yarling Live at The Manchester Craftsman Guild and the Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars's Things to Come, among others.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E

500|$|Four singles were {{released}} to promote Aphrodite. [...] "All the Lovers" [...] was released as its lead single in June 2010. Explaining {{her decision to}} release it as the lead single, Minogue said that [...] "as I was recording it I knew that [...] "All The Lovers" [...] {{had to be the}} first single; it sums up the euphoria of the album perfectly. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> goose-bumps, so I'm really excited to hear what everyone thinks of it". Commercially, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] performed well, particularly in Europe. It peaked at number three on the UK Singles chart, where it was later certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 200,000 units. The single also reached the top ten in France, Italy, where it was later certified gold, Scotland, and Spain, where it peaked atop the physical singles chart. In Australia, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] missed peaking inside the top ten by reaching number 13 on the singles chart. In this region, it was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 35,000 units. In the United States, the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features Minogue singing the song, dressed in a white cobweb-style T-shirt worn over a black bra and knickers, while standing atop a mountain of lingerie-clad couples caressing each other.|$|E
500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just want to go there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – but, as I said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
