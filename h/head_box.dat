40|$|Introduction: This report {{describes}} the fabrication and laboratory testing of a 1 / 12 scale {{model of the}} 5 branch converging manifold to be installed {{as a component of}} the Virginia Electric and Power Company 1974 extension of the Yorktown power station. The design of the manifold (see Fig. 1) was supplied by Brown 2 ̆ 6 Root, Inc. The geometry of Branch number 1 as shown on Fig. 1 was modified slightly from the original design after conferring with Browth 2 ̆ 6 Root, Inc. in order to facilitate the fabrication of this branch of the model. In addition to the fabrication of the manifold model, facilities were constructed to carry out the testing of the model. These facilities consisted of: (1) a <b>head</b> <b>box</b> designed to force equal flow rates through all five inlet branches of the manifold (see Fig. 2), (2) five inlet pipes which convey the water from the five units in the <b>head</b> <b>box</b> to each of five branches, (3) a 20 -foot long 14 inch inside diameter pipe which conveyed the discharge from the manifold, and (4) a discharge box with means for controlling the downstream head by means of two gates, one of which closes the discharge pipe and the other controls the water level in the box. The test facilities were located in the hydraulic laboratory of the Utah Water Research Laboratory taking the water supply from one of the 16 inch main supply lines and discharging the flow into a 3 -foot wide channel in the floor of the hydraulic laboratory which conveys the water to the weighing tanks for accurate flow rate determinations.

40|$|In {{the flow}} {{distribution}} {{section of a}} paper machine, known as the <b>head</b> <b>box,</b> water is injected into the fiber suspension (stock) flow through a tee-mixer for more uniform production. This dilution process has two important requirements that must be fulfilled: (1) sufficient mixing so that the dilution flow spreads across the suspension flow and (2) that the injection flow rate not be so large to significantly alter the local <b>head</b> <b>box</b> flow rate. The objective {{of this research was}} to find a combination of velocity ratio and tee mixer geometry that lead to the injection flow being well mixed into the stock flow, but at the same time, the injection should not cause the total flow rate to change by more than 1 %. Velocity ratios of 0. 25, 0. 75, 1. 33, 1. 5 and 2. 25 were examined for four different cases of tee mixer geometries using the CFD software Fluent. Two of the cases had added contractions located near the injection point, while the other two cases had a more standard geometry with no added complexities. The pressure drop across the injection point was also measured. Mixing was qualitatively measured by simulating the injection of a passive tracer into the dilution flow. All of the results indicated that the case where the contraction was located after the injection showed the most promising results with quality mixing and lower flow rates. The cases without added contractions showed poor mixing for lower velocity ratios, and for higher velocity ratios, the flow rates were too large. The cases with contractions showed similar mixing, but the outlet flow rates produced were lower when the contraction was located after the injection instead of before it. A velocity ratio of 0. 25 - 0. 75 for the mixers with contractions produced acceptable flow rates and sufficient mixing. The simulations also showed that the static pressure for the contraction cases were nearly identical throughout the majority of the pipe. For both contraction cases the pressure drop across the injection increased with increasing injection flow rate. When the contraction was located before the injection, a pressure drop of 16 % was calculated. A pressure drop of 18 % to 20 % across the injection resulted when the contraction was located after the injection. M. S. Committee Chair: Aidun, Cyrus; Committee Member: S.

40|$|Paper {{manufacturing}} plants now use two drying technologies, impingement heating from air jets, and conduction heating from steam cylinders. Pulse air drying (PAD) improves the existing impingement system {{by increasing the}} heat transfer rate. Typical M. G. or Yankee style paper machines could see a 20 % production increase by retrofitting this technology. However, past studies and pilot plants have suffered from unpredictable performance, and two main problems still exist. First, pulse drying doesn’t have the complete theoretical foundation that steady flow drying has, and secondly, the PAD process requires a pulse burner with significantly different performance characteristics than the pulse burners now used in other industries. The author will {{provide an overview of}} existing technologies, an appraisal of the remaining technical hurtles, and estimates of technology’s economic viability, energy savings, maintenance requirements, and emissions impact.

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the forming section. The forming section is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a <b>head</b> <b>box.</b> The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the forming fabric after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the forming fabric. The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the forming fabric. External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the forming section. The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the forming section. Three different forming fabrics from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the forming fabrics were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a vacuum dewatering trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes. The results showed higher water content for the paper that was on top of the forming fabric with the larger pores...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fork <b>head</b> <b>box</b> P 1 (FOXP 1) is a FOX family {{transcription}} factor influencing ERα;-regulated transcription by {{interaction with the}} ERα; related pioneer factor FOXA 1. Altered FOXP 1 expression is seen in breast and prostate cancers. This study investigated FOXP 1 at the protein level in breast cancer (BC) and examined associations with clinicopathological and molecular features. Methods: FOXP 1 mRNA expression was investigated in the METABRIC BC cohort (n= 1980) and validated using online expression datasets [bc-GenExMiner v 4. 0]. Protein expression was studied in a well characterised BC primary series (n= 621) using immunohistochemistry and correlations made with clinicopathological parameters and outcome. Results: High FOXP 1 mRNA and protein expression {{was significantly associated with}} low grade, low NPI, positive ER/PR status, lobular BCs, low Ki 67 and negative Her 2 status (p< 0. 001). Within PAM 50 subtypes, high FOXP 1 expression was associated with Luminal A BCs and good prognosis integrative clusters (IC 3 and IC 8). Nuclear FOXP 1 (n-FOXP 1) protein positively associated with luminal markers: CARM 1, RERG and FOXA 1 (p< 0. 05). Negative association with PIK 3 (p= 0. 023) indicates a possible dual role whereby n-FOXP 1 reduces EGFR-mediated ligand-independent ER activation, but enhances AKT mediated activation. Positive correlations with GATA 3, STAT 3 and CDC 42 (p< 0. 001), suggest interacting pathways. On univariate analysis, n-FOXP 1 overexpression showed better long term outcome in the whole cohort and ER+ subgroups (p< 0. 05). Pooled FOXP 1 gene expression data in the ER+ external validation cohort showed similar association with better outcome even when adjusted for NPI/proliferation (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Higher n-FOXP 1 correlated with low grade ER positive BCs and spelt better prognosis with increased long-term survival. The marker may be helpful to distinguish between good versus poor prognosis luminal A tumours...|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{restriction}} (DR) is {{a robust}} non-genetic intervention that reduces {{morbidity and mortality}} {{in a range of}} organisms. This suggests the presence of an evolutionary-conserved pathway that regulates aging and lifespan in response to reduced food or energy intake. Recent genetic analyses have shown that single gene mutations could extend the lifespan, even in mammals. Many longevity genes are clustered into nutrient-sensing and metabolic adaptation pathways, which are also thought {{to be involved in the}} effect of DR. The responses of these mutant animals to DR in terms of lifespan or other aging phenotypes suggest that proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the effects of DR. This review focuses on the roles of fork <b>head</b> <b>box</b> O (FoxO) transcription factors, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and sirtuins (particularly SIRT 1) in the effects of DR in rodents. FoxO transcription factors are mammalian orthologs of DAF- 16, which is required for the lifespan extending effects of reduced insulin-like signaling in nematodes. A recent study in rodents suggested that FoxO 1 is involved in the anti-neoplastic effects of DR. Although aak 2 in nematodes (mammalian AMPK), Sir 2 in yeast and Sir 2. 1 in nematodes (mammalian SIRT 1) were also reported to be essential for lifespan extension by DR, the findings are thought to depend on the genetic backgrounds of the organisms and/or methods used to induce DR. In rodents, AMPK and SIRT 1 are implicated in the metabolic regulation by long-term DR. Genetic and molecular dissection of the mechanisms underlying the effects of DR will provide us with knowledge of the basic aging processes, as well as insights into the development of DR mimetics, to extend the healthy lifespan in humans...|$|E
