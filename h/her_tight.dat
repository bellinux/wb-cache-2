Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed him {{all the way to the}} White House.|$|E
25|$|Historiography {{is divided}} over the {{possibility}} of Pătrășcanu having initially allied himself with the PCR's second in command, Ana Pauker, in her post-war confrontation with Gheorghiu-Dej. It is apparent that Pătrășcanu was alarmed by Pauker's close cooperation with Soviet overseers, and especially by <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> connection with Dmitry Manuilsky; it was also contended that Pauker was intrigued by Pătrășcanu's self-promotion in front of Soviet overseers during late 1944. Under arrest, however, Pătrășcanu asserted that he was closest to Pauker and Teohari Georgescu among the Romanian party leaders.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Streisand began devoting most of {{her time}} towards {{directing}} the 1991 film adaptation of Pat Conroy's 1986 novel The Prince of Tides. Due to <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> schedule and limited availability, Columbia Records approached Streisand on releasing another greatest hits album, since she had been in a similar situation during the distribution of her prior compilation release, Memories (1981). A Collection: Greatest Hits...and More was released as a compact disc (CD) in the United States on October 3, 1989 by Columbia Records. The compilation was executively produced by Streisand, Charles Koppelman, and Peter Matz. It was reissued in select European territories in 1997 by Columbia's worldwide label, CBS Records International.|$|E

500|$|According to Simon Cowell, {{owner of}} the music {{production}} company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended [...] "Halo" [...] for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether [...] "Halo" [...] had initially been written for Lewis. Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyoncé {{waited a long time}} before recording it. He commented: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by Alain Whyte, Allessandro Benassi, Brian Kennedy, Chris Brown, Jean-Baptiste, Marco Benassi, Michael McHenry, Nick Marsh, Priscilla Hamilton, Ryan Buendia and William Orbit. It was {{produced}} by Benny and Alle Benassi, David Guetta, Free School, Orbit and Kennedy. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] was originally intended for American pop singer Madonna's twelfth studio album MDNA (2012); however, she could not record the song because of <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> schedule, and Orbit gave the song to Brown. After an unofficial version of [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] was leaked online in January 2012, websites reported that the song was produced by David Guetta. However, Guetta said on his Facebook and Twitter accounts, [...] "I'm credited for 'Don't Wake Me Up' ... but I did not produce this record. Best to CB!".|$|E
500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You must manage somehow,' he answered, {{and held}} <b>her</b> <b>tighter</b> than ever. She {{led him into}} a large hall filled with stone statues, which once had been men, and, {{pointing}} out one, she said, 'There is your brother.' ...|$|R

500|$|Hamasaki's {{influence}} {{goes beyond}} music; she is often considered a fashion icon and trend-setter, a status attributed to <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> control over her image. Besides her frequent appearances in fashion magazines, such as Vivi, Popteen, and Cawaii!, Hamasaki {{has often been}} lauded for her trendy choices in apparels and accessories; Oricon has repeatedly named her the [...] "Most Fashionable Female Artist". Many aspects of Japan's fashions—including clothing, hair, nails, and accessories—have in some way been influenced by her. As with her music, trends Hamasaki started have spread to Asian countries as Taiwan, China, and Singapore. Among the trends Hamasaki has started is hime-kei (a look inspired by the fashions of 18th century French aristocracy); she has also heavily influenced the kogal subculture. Hamasaki's constantly changing image is apparent not only in her fashion photo shoots and commercial endorsements but also in her record covers, an element she considers essential in conveying her message. She has portrayed herself as a vine-clad [...] "peace muse" [...] or [...] "Greek goddess" [...] (on her album I Am...), as a [...] "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" [...] (for her single [...] "Free & Easy"), and as a [...] "funky Lolita". Though Hamasaki has portrayed herself in earlier releases as a [...] "girl next door", she has adopted a more sexualized image since the release of Loveppears. The covers for records including Loveppears, I Am..., Rainbow, and Party Queen feature Hamasaki in states of partial nudity, for which she has generated controversy. Hamasaki also garnered criticism after she modeled bra for lingerie manufacturer Wacoal, {{though most of the}} criticism alleged that Hamasaki was only trying to [...] "play catch-up" [...] with Kumi Koda, who gained popularity for her overtly sexual image.|$|E
2500|$|Maria de Medici wears a bodice with split, round hanging sleeves. <b>Her</b> <b>tight</b> undersleeves are chartacteristic of Spanish influence. From {{the folds}} of her skirt, she appears to be wearing a small roll over a narrow Spanish farthingale. Note that her oversleeves are the same shape as those worn by Lettice Knollys.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the oft-remarked affinity with Moore, affinities with poets May Swenson, Stevie Smith, Emily Dickinson, Wendy Cope, and Amy Clampitt have been noted by some critics. Thus Katha Pollitt wrote that Ryan's fourth collection, Elephant Rocks (1997), is [...] "Stevie Smith rewritten by William Blake" [...] but that Say Uncle (2000) [...] "is like a poetical offspring of George Herbert and the British comic poet Wendy Cope." [...] Another reviewer of Say Uncle (2000) wrote of Ryan, [...] "Her casual manner and nods to the wisdom tradition might endear her to fans of A. R. Ammons or link her distantly to Emily Dickinson. But <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> structures, odd rhymes and ethical judgments place her more firmly {{in the tradition of}} Marianne Moore and, latterly, Amy Clampitt." ...|$|E
6000|$|Aurora, who look'd more {{on books}} than faces, [...] Was very young, {{although}} so very sage, [...] Admiring more Minerva than the Graces, [...] Especially upon a printed page.

2500|$|During {{the concert}} in Paris, France {{as part of}} the On the Run Tour on September 12 and 13, 2014, Minaj joined Beyoncé onstage to perform the remix of [...] "Flawless" [...] live. Both singers were dressed in clothes {{designed}} by Versace's Versus. Jocely Vena writing for Billboard described the performance as [...] "lawless indeed". Lewis Corner in a review for the Digital Spy felt that Minaj [...] "bolster its [...] weight with <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> rhymes". During an interview with radio station SkyRock FM, Minaj revealed that she felt honored and emotional to perform together with Beyoncé and acknowledged that she was surprised by the positive reaction of the audience when she appeared. The live video of the song which was featured on the HBO special [...] was released on Beyoncé's Vevo account on October 6, 2014. Minaj also performed her verse of the song at the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Festival where she sang a cappella during the last part of it.|$|E

50|$|Later, Bayley {{defended the}} Raw Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair.

As Charlotte tried to pin Bayley with a roll-up by grabbing <b>her</b> <b>tights,</b> Banks notified the referee, who stopped the pin. Bayley then performed another Bayley-to-Belly on Charlotte to retain the title, marking Charlotte's first loss in a singles match on pay-per-view.|$|R
5000|$|She {{performed}} in local pantomime, notably in Blackpool, performing as [...] "Mona Vivian and her Blackpool Wavelets", where she sang of leaving half <b>her</b> <b>tights</b> on the flying trapeze, and swayed her hips {{in imitation of}} Mae West, saying [...] "Say, don't anybody recognise the motions". She would tell {{a member of the}} orchestra that his name must be Nero because [...] "I'm burning up - while he's fiddling".|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} Mixer {{had not been}} {{subjected}} to a sexual assault, the fact <b>her</b> <b>tights</b> had been lowered to expose her thighs and sanitary towel suggested a sexual motive behind the murder, and although the victim had not been beaten, stabbed or mutilated, her student status, the tying of a garment around her neck, and the proximity of her abduction and murder led investigators to tentatively link her murder to those of Fleszar and Schell, despite lingering doubts she {{had been killed by}} the same perpetrator.|$|R
6000|$|Anderson held <b>her</b> <b>tight</b> {{against his}} broad breast that lifted her with its great heave. [...] "Ah-huh! Reckon that's some relief. I wasn't so darn sure," [...] said Anderson. [...] "Has he spoken to you?" ...|$|E

The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.|$|E
