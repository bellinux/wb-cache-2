Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an {{electrical}} engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station {{in the world in}} 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain's defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti's design of increasing AC voltage to high tension at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all electricity networks take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of <b>electricity</b> <b>transmission</b> cables.|$|E
