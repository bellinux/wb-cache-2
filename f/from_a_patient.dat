5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{that the patient}} dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, {{that is a}} marker of disease or risk in a sample taken <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient.</b> Preservation of the sample before analysis is critical. Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it is vulnerable to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated in preservation agents.|$|E

5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E

25|$|Tetanus {{was well}} known to ancient people who {{recognized}} the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms. In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves.|$|E

25|$|It is {{also argued}} that this {{augmented}} understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through {{an understanding of the}} different levels in the causal process where one can intervene.

Linden's (2006) demonstration of how psychotherapy has neurobiological commonalities with pharmacotherapy is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.|$|E

25|$|Functional assays, i.e. an assay {{that tries}} to {{quantify}} functioning of an active substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patients plasma by adding exogenous formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) & VWF (usually endogenous).|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{bleeding}} control describes {{actions that}} control bleeding <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> who {{has suffered a}} traumatic injury or who has a medical condition that has caused bleeding. Many bleeding control techniques are taught as part of first aid throughout the world, though some more advanced techniques such as tourniquets, are often taught as being reserved for use by health professionals, or as an absolute last resort, to mitigate associated risks, such as potential loss of limbs. To manage bleeding effectively, {{it is important to}} be able to readily identify types of wounds and types of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|UD {{requires}} {{the establishment of}} an extracorporeal circulation through its unique AV loop with two pre-existing arterial and central venous lines in ICU patients. When the saline indicator is injected into the AV loop, it is detected by the venous clamp-on sensor on the loop before it enters the patient’s heart's right atrium. After the indicator traverses the heart and lung, the concentration curve in the arterial line is recorded and displayed on the COstatus HCM101 Monitor. Cardiac output is calculated from the area of the concentration curve using the Stewart-Hamilton equation. UD is a non-invasive procedure, requiring only a connection to the AV loop and two lines <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient.</b> UD has been specialised for application in pediatric ICU patients and has been demonstrated to be relatively safe although invasive and reproducible.|$|E

500|$|In 1983, two {{separate}} research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier independently declared that a novel retrovirus {{may have been}} infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings {{in the same issue}} of the journal Science.

Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. [...] At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two classic symptoms of AIDS.

500|$|In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings {{clarifying}} {{the constitutionality of}} physical intrusions into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth. Officers were unable to force his mouth open, so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it [...] "shocked the conscience", and was so [...] "brutal" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] {{that it did not}} comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency. In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples [...] "taken by a skilled technician" [...] neither [...] "shocked the conscience" [...] nor violated substantive due process. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> suspected of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} while he lay unconscious in a hospital. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because [...] "modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection."
