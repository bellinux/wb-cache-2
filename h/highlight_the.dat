5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet.

However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
