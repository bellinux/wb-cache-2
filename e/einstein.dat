5|$|Albert <b>Einstein</b> {{was born}} in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14March 1879. His parents were Hermann <b>Einstein,</b> a {{salesman}} and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, {{the family moved to}} Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. <b>Einstein</b> & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einstein</b> {{discovered}} Louis de Broglie's work, {{and supported}} his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, <b>Einstein</b> gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which <b>Einstein</b> suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einstein</b> married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, {{after having}} had a {{personal}} relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa <b>Einstein</b> was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936.|$|E

5|$|<b>Einstein</b> was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with <b>Einstein</b> in the preceding years. To protect <b>Einstein,</b> Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding <b>Einstein,</b> published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, <b>Einstein</b> and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which <b>Einstein</b> was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, <b>Einstein</b> was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with <b>Einstein</b> on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, <b>Einstein</b> {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the <b>Einstein</b> model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. <b>Einstein</b> was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E

5|$|While traveling, <b>Einstein</b> wrote {{daily to}} his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were {{included}} in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. Margot <b>Einstein</b> permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). <b>Einstein</b> had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert <b>Einstein</b> Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.|$|E

5|$|<b>Einstein</b> {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. <b>Einstein</b> noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Einstein</b> {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. <b>Einstein</b> relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. <b>Einstein</b> quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

The partnership allows Fordham undergraduate and graduate science students to take classes, conduct research, and pursue early admission to select programs of <b>Einstein.</b> In addition, it involves a physician mentoring program, which permits students to shadow an attending physician at Einstein's Montefiore Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert <b>Einstein</b> in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the <b>Einstein</b> field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the <b>Einstein</b> field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, <b>Einstein</b> {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, <b>Einstein</b> introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the <b>Einstein</b> World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
