40|$|At the BESSY II {{synchrotron}} radiation facility a new Optics Beamline is presently set into operation {{within the framework}} of our newly established grating production facility. It is coupled with a versatile Reflectometer as a permanent end station for at wavelength characterization and calibration of the in house produced precision gratings, mirrors, multilayered systems and novel nano optical devices. The Plane Grating Monochromator PGM beamline operated in collimated light is equipped with an old SX 700 monochromator, of which the blazed gratings 600 and 1200 l mm have been exchanged by new ones of improved performance produced inhouse. Over the operating range from 10 to 2000 eV this bending magnet beamline has very high spectral purity achieved by 1 a four mirror arrangement of different coatings which can be inserted into the beam at different angles and 2 by absorber filters for high order suppression. Stray light and scattered radiation is removed efficiently by in situ exchangeable apertures and slits. Thus the new Optics Beamline together with the new versatile reflectometer is a powerful metrology tool for XUV reflectivity measurements in s or p polarisation geometry with linearly or <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> on large samples up to 300 mm length and 4 kg weight.

40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) {{has been}} {{utilised}} {{in various forms}} in sensors for many years. It is usually based on angular or wavelength interrogation of the reflectivity minimum found with Transverse Magnetic (TM) light. However, as the SPR is traversed {{there is also a}} very rapid change in the phase of the reflected TM light there being no such change in the Transverse Electric (TE) light. Presented in the thesis a new SPR sensor has been developed that exploits this rapid change in optical phase. Linearly polarised light of mixed TM/TE polarisation is passed through a polarization modulator, which adds a small amplitude modulation to the polarisation. This modulated light is incident on a gold film 40 nm thick evaporated onto the base of a SF 2 prism in the Kretschmann-Raether, configuration. The coupling of the TM polarised light to the SPR is dependant on the properties of the dielectric medium adjacent to the gold film. The SPR shifts when this sensed medium undergoes a change in refractive index (or index or thickness if it is a bound analyte layer). This in turn causes a change in the reflected <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> The change of the resultant modulated polarisation dither is interrogated {{through the use of a}} phase sensitive detectors. Initially a simple photo diode coupled with a lock-in amplifier was used to monitor the modulated signal. This was expanded into an imaging technique by using two cameras (64 by 64 pixels) fabricated with the equivalent of a lock-in amplifier on each of the 4096 pixels. The spatial map of the modulation amplitude gives an optical phase differential image. By imaging in this way it is possible to produce a multi channel differential sensorEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceRCUKGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We focus on ionisation injection configurations and in the conditions where the laser pulse driver can force collective betatron oscillations over the whole trapped electron bunch. With an analytical model and by employing three dimensional simulations and radiation calculations, we find that circularly or <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> laser drivers can force helical betatron oscillations, which produce circularly/elliptically polarised betatron x-rays. We assess the level of polarisation numerically and analytically, and find {{that the number of}} circularly polarised photons can be controlled by tuning the laser pulse driver polarisation. We show the production of betatron radiation that is circularly polarised up to < 40 % close to regions of maximum photon flux. The total flux of circularly polarised betatron radiation drops for <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> drivers, and is negligible when using linear polarisation. Our results can be tested today in current experimental facilities. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|Polarisation {{effects in}} the {{microcavity}} parametric oscillator are studied using a simple model in which two chi-three optical parametric oscillators are coupled together. It is found that there are, in general, a number of steady states of the model under continuous pumping. There are both continuous and discontinuous thresholds, at which new steady-states appear as the driving intensity is increased: at the continuous thresholds, the new state has zero output intensity, whereas at the discontinuous threshold it has a finite output intensity. The discontinuous thresholds have no analog in the uncoupled device. The coupling also generates rotations of the linear polarisation of the output compared with the pump, and shifts in the output frequencies as the driving polarisation or intensity is varied. For large ratios {{of the interaction between}} polarisations to the interaction within polarisations, of the order of 5, one of the thresholds has its lowest value when the pump is <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised.</b> This is consistent with recent experiments in which the maximum output was achieved with an <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> pump.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals that appear as non-birefringent when observed under the <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> microscope.  METHODS—Two observers examined independently 10  synovial fluid samples obtained during an episode of arthritis attributable to CPPD crystals. Ten synovial fluid samples from patients with acute gout were used as a reference. The examination was performed after placing a fluid sample in a Niebauer haemocytometric chamber; a crystal count was done first under ordinary light, then in the area corresponding to a 0. 1  ml, under <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> RESULTS—The percentages of birefringence appreciated for CPPD were 18 % (confidence intervals (CI) 12,  24) for observer 1, and 17 % (CI 10,  24) for observer 2  (difference NS). The percentages of birefringence for monosodium urate were 127 % (CI 103,  151) for observer 1  and 107 % (CI 100,  114) for observer 2  (difference NS). Percentages above 100 % indicate that crystals missed under ordinary light became apparent under <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b>  CONCLUSION—Only about one fifth of all CPPD crystals identified by bright field microscopy show birefringence when the same synovial fluid sample is observed under <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> If a search for CPPD crystals is conducted under <b>polarised</b> <b>light,</b> {{the majority of the}} crystals will be missed.

40|$|In this digital era, {{the usage}} of smart phones and mobile devices is {{becoming}} a norm in society with mobile communication quickly transitioned from voice oriented transmission to picture transmission to a more complex live video streaming. This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign. Results concluded that at short distances with low scattering in the channel and directional antennas, <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarised</b> antennas provide improved multiplexing gain over dual linear polarisations.

New microscopical and mathematical methods have made the techniques worthy of reappraisal. I used quantative <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> microscopy to examine tissue structure at both the fibre and molecular level. Birefringent materials, those with an anisotropic molecular organisation (such as collagen, muscle and elastin), can be studied using <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> The optical properties of birefringent materials {{were used to determine}} fibre orientation. Two-dimensional orientation was measured on the planar rotating microscope stage and three-dimensional orientation on a Universal stage. Molecular organisation, which affects optical anisotropy, was assessed by measuring the path-difference or retardation when linearly <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> passes through birefringent materials. Five projects, focussing on collagen and muscle in cardiovascular tissues, were undertaken to demonstrate the usefulness of <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> microscopy in structural studies.;I measured the two-dimensional orientation of cardiac muscle fibres in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developed a quantitative method to complement the current qualitative method of diagnosis. I used the Universal stage to measure the orientation of collagen fibres in brain arteries and found that the fibres were predominantly circumferentially aligned at normal systolic pressures, but, at higher pressures a population of fibres had large longitudinal components of orientation. I measured the retardation in scar collagen produced following myocardial infarction and found that changes in the optical properties of collagen could be detected for at least six weeks after its production. A measured difference in retardation in tendons from floppy mitral valves, indicated that degraded collagen can also be detected using <b>polarised</b> <b>light.</b> Both fibre orientation and molecular organisation were assessed in cerebral saccular aneurysms. The aneurysm wall was layered and the collagen fibres were organised in a complex three-dimensional weave, suggesting a strong structure; however, the retardation in the aneurysm was lower than normal, indicating less molecular organisation and a possible reason why aneurysms enlarge and rupture.;The general conclusion is that quantitative <b>polarised</b> <b>light</b> mircoscopy remains an effective method in structural analysis...|$|R
