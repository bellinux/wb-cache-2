William Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Edgar, the latter from King Lear, <b>feigned</b> insanity so perfectly we ‘forget they are feigned’. Prior to the mid nineteenth century, discussions of <b>feigned</b> insanity tended to take place within broader discussions of malingering to avoid military service. As the nineteenth century progressed, alienists, or psychiatrists as they are now known, felt it increasingly necessary to study the features of <b>feigned</b> insanity, and particularly convicts who <b>feigned</b> madness, with the aim of gaining admission into an asylum, in order to escape punishment. Despite a wealth of scholarship on the history of psychiatry, prisons and criminals, historians have paid surprisingly little attention to how <b>feigned</b> insanity was understood and detected by British alienists, prison medical officers (PMOs) and asylum superintendents, or why convicts <b>feigned</b> insanity. Utilizing the published works of alienists, PMOs and asylum superintendents, alongside the case files of convicts transferred from prison to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum in the late-Victorian period, this paper does two things. First, it examines how Victorian medical men conceptualised <b>feigned</b> insanity, and shows how discussions of <b>feigned</b> madness related to broader concerns regarding the recidivist (also known as the habitual criminal or repeat offender). Second, it examines why convicts <b>feigned</b> madness, {{and the extent to which}} this corresponded to broader medical understandings of malingering. It is suggested that convicts <b>feigned</b> insanity to resist the prison system, and to obtain respite from the harsh prison environment by being transferred to an asylum. Their attempts to do this demonstrate one way by which convicts could exercise agency within the regulatory Victorian prison system...|$|R

The plan he laid out made far greater use of the particular skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in ambush. The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then <b>feign</b> retreat and draw them into the ambush.|$|E

5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to <b>feign</b> death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production {{on the theme of}} tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to <b>feign</b> illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic speech, about the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) and the need for strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} an Austrian army {{during the}} Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until {{the arrival of}} the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could <b>feign</b> a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to uncover the meaning of holy <b>feigning</b> in the late-antique Christian text the Apophthegmata Patrum, or Sayings of the Desert Fathers [and Mothers]. Whereas stories in this text depict demonic <b>feigning</b> as a regular {{occurrence}} (demons often appearing in the guise of a fellow desert dweller), what I call ‘holy feigning’ depicts one desert Christian expressing empathy for the situation of another – and helping the other to change. By looking at two stories that are paradigmatic of holy <b>feigning,</b> I show that exemplary deceptive behaviour, though explicitly defying the otherwise consistent rhetoric of ‘radical self-honesty’ in the Apophthegmata Patrum, paradoxically marks out the person who <b>feigns</b> as holy, discerning and imitative of Christ. In this article, I offer several suggestions for accounting for this seeming contradiction in the desert literature and propose how a spirituality of holy <b>feigning</b> might remain meaningful to readers of this literature today...|$|R
40|$|Malingered {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) poses a formidable clinical challenge in personal injury and disability cases because of the apparent ease in <b>feigning</b> PTSD and the supposed link (proximate cause) to the claimed damages. The effective assessment of <b>feigned</b> PTSD is particularly challenging because this diagnosis is both easier to fake than other Axis I disorders {{and more difficult to}} detect. As an additional confound, some patients with genuine PTSD produce highly variable, elevated profiles on multiscale inventories that are difficult to distinguish from <b>feigned</b> PTSD. The current study examined whether the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) can effectively differentiate between genuine and <b>feigned</b> PTSD in 109 inpatients from a trauma unit. The two most effective scales were the MAL and the NDS scales. As a primary focus, the current study was the first empirical investigation of Resnick's model of malingered PTSD that is comprised of three subtypes: pure malingering (pure-M), partial malingering (partial-M), and false imputation (false-I). The primary goal was to evaluate whether each <b>feigning</b> group was able to (a) effectively simulate PTSD symptoms and diagnoses and (b) avoid being classified as <b>feigning.</b> The partial-M group proved to be the best <b>feigning</b> group in achieving these two goals. Furthermore, the use of well-defined groups, including an indeterminate band (i. e., unclassified) around each cut score, was explored. Overall, the use of well-defined groups improved accuracy in classification and reduced the number of false-positives...|$|R
5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of French intervention, the British sought to concentrate their land and naval forces in one location, New York City. In May 1778, the British began to evacuate Philadelphia. On 18 May, Washington dispatched Lafayette with a 2,200-man force to reconnoiter near Barren Hill, Pennsylvania. The next day, the British heard that Lafayette had made camp nearby and sent 5,000men to trap and capture him. On 20 May, General Howe led a further 6,000soldiers and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To <b>feign</b> numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear from the woods on an outcropping (now Lafayette Hill) and to fire upon the British periodically. Lafayette's troops simultaneously escaped via a sunken road, and he was then able to cross Matson's Ford with the remainder of his force.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may <b>feign</b> death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe neural {{correlates}} of motor inhibition leading to paresis in conversion disorder {{are not well}} known. The key question is whether they are different of those of normal subjects <b>feigning</b> the symptoms. Thirteen conversion disorder patients with hemiparesis and twelve healthy controls were investigated using functional magnetic resonance tomography under conditions of passive motor stimulation of the paretic/feigned paretic and the non-paretic hand. Healthy controls were also investigated in a non-feigning condition. During passive movement of the affected right hand conversion disorder patients exhibited activations in the bilateral triangular part of the inferior frontal gyri (IFG), with a left side dominance compared to controls in non-feigning condition. <b>Feigning</b> controls revealed for the same condition a weak unilateral activation in the right triangular part of IFG and an activity decrease in frontal midline areas, which couldn't be observed in patients. The results suggest that motor inhibition in conversion disorder patients is mediated by the IFG that was also involved in inhibition processes in normal subjects. The activity pattern in <b>feigning</b> controls resembled that of conversion disorder patients but with a clear difference in the medial prefrontal cortex. Healthy controls showed decreased activity in this region during <b>feigning</b> compared to non-feigning conditions suggesting a reduced sense of self-agency during <b>feigning.</b> Remarkably, no activity differences could be observed in medial prefrontal cortex for patients vs healthy controls in <b>feigning</b> or non-feigning conditions suggesting self-agency related activity in patients to be in between those of non-feigning and <b>feigning</b> healthy subjects...|$|R

25|$|Job {{interviews}} {{and other data}} on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to <b>feign</b> unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to <b>feign,</b> which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.|$|E
