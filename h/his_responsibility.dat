5|$|Using <b>his</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat as a pretext, Meyszner {{constantly}} {{interfered with}} operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces {{at his disposal}} comprised the 5th SS-Polizei Regiment, minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.|$|E
5|$|After the United Kingdom's {{entry into}} World War I in 1914, Wheeler {{volunteered for the}} armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering. For the next seven months, he was posted as an {{instructor}} in the University of London Officer Training Corps. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing {{his wife and child}} with him; <b>his</b> <b>responsibility</b> was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.|$|E

5|$|Philip's {{relatively}} lenient {{treatment of}} the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and {{during the next few}} months the whole Phocian confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged <b>his</b> <b>responsibility</b> to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try and avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly <b>his</b> <b>responsibility</b> and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to}} have treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged <b>his</b> <b>responsibility</b> to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi.

5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not <b>his</b> <b>responsibility,</b> he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E
