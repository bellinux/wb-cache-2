5000|$|The game allows {{up to four}} players. The table has a {{completely}} symmetric playfield layout. The machine has a simple straight-forward rule set that offers a challenge to beginners and advanced players. Basically, there are three goals to accomplish: knock down the drop targets, complete the A-B combination {{a certain number of}} times and land in the <b>kickout</b> hole multiple times. The rules in detail are the following: Making ‘A’ and ‘B’ top rollover lanes or left and right ‘A’ and ‘B’ orbits scores and advances ‘A-B’ lit value which is displayed in the centre of the playfield. Landing the ball in the top <b>kickout</b> hole first time scores 3000 points, advances bonus value 3 places, lights 2x bonus multiplier and lights left outlane for 50,000 points. Second time lights right outlane for 50.000 points and 3x bonus multiplier. Third time lights 5x bonus multiplier. Knocking down all drop targets scores 50.000 points and lights target special light. A replay is available for making ‘A’ and ‘B’ when lit for special and another +50K for all target down when lit for special. The maximum is one extra ball per ball in play.|$|E

50|$|A play usually {{run from}} a wing-t {{formation}} {{that includes a}} variety of play fakes. The quarterback takes the snap and fakes trap to the fullback. He then hands off to a halfback or wingback, who runs to the outside.

This allows for the other linemen to downblock on the other defenders, giving the offense an advantage {{when it comes to}} blocking angles. The buck sweep also provides an advantage in the possibilities available from its action, with the fullback trap before the sweep, the waggle pass or bootleg after it, and the sweep itself.|$|E

He started by buying Auðun Helgason, a former Icelandic international football player Assistant manager. For the third time in three years, a new coach would take the helm {{and most of the time}} it seemed as if nobody could lead Fram Reykjavík out of the dark.

Fram Reykjavík against FH Hafnarfjörður where they won away which was for the first time in many years, the team that was supposed to be unbeatable they managed to win. The following weekend, Fram Reykjavík beat Keflavík, securing the club's third position in the league for the first time since 1992. Fram Reykjavík was back in European competition: the team that almost drew at Nou Camp 18 years ago was back, and there was more good news to come, Þorvaldur Örlygsson accepted a new offer to be the manager. The summer of 2009 came out to be not as good as expected in Úrvalsdeild Fram Reykjavík finished 4th, which was an obvious disappointment. And in Visa-Bikar 2009 Fram Reykjavík made it to the finals but lost in penalty <b>kickout</b> against Breiðablik UBK where Paul McShane missed the last penally for Fram Reykjavík, in UEFA Cup 2009 Fram won The New Saints F.C. easily in the first round but in the second round Fram Reykjavík traveled to Czech Republic to play Sigma Olomouc the first match went 1-1 where Sigma scored a goal almost in the last second of the match. The second match Sigma Olomouc won but Fram Reykjavík was told to have played maybe their best matches of the summer there and they showed that on a good day they could play like the big teams in Europe. Before the 2009 season Þorvaldur Örlygsson brought several new players to Fram Reykjavík, one of them being Jón Gunnar Eysteinsson who Þorvaldur Örlygsson knew well from Fjarðabyggð, he was supposed to come instead of Auðun Helgason that went to Grindavík and Some other players like the English brothers which both started their career playing for Chelsea F.C., Joe Tillen and Sam Tillen the team of 2010 was one of the youngest teams ever in Icelandic football, the oldest player was 25 years old.

The activation energy for the <b>kickout</b> process is 2. 49 eV in GaP and 1. 60 eV in InP, and therefore unintentional diffusion of Zn should be a larger concern in InP than in GaP. The dependence of the activation energy both on the doping conditions of the material and on the stoichiometry is explained, and found to be in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed dependencies. The calculated activation energies agree reasonably with experimental data, assuming that the region from which Zn diffuses is p type. Explanations are also found as to why Zn tends to accumulate at pn junctions in InP and to why a relatively low fraction of Zn is found on substitutional sites in InP...|$|E
