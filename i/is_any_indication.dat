[...] The mixtape was largely a solo effort, featuring only Andy Milonakis and Glo Gang labelmate, Benji Glo. In 2015, Keef's track [...] "Faneto" [...] was noted for slowly building momentum since its October 2014 release.

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8 out of 10 and {{summarized}} the episode as being [...] "a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' {{but in the}} shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels a bit too much like filler... If the conclusion of 'The Lie' <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> though, the outside world may prove to be just as strange as the island." [...] IGN later ranked [...] "The Lie" [...] 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing [...] "this isn't a terrible episode, but it feels like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes. On the Island, we do get to see a pretty cool looking Flaming Arrow attack, that kills the uber-annoying Frogurt, but the encounter the group has at the end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for the awesome [...] "Jughead." ...|$|E

500|$|Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly {{declared}} {{that if the}} [...] "Roseland show <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> Gaga's not going anywhere anytime soon", {{in spite of the}} overall negative reception towards her campaigns for Artpop. He welcomed the absence of any art-related things in the show and commended the focus on music, Gaga's vocals and abilities as an entertainer. Markovitz also complimented Gaga's rapport with the audience members and rated the performances of [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance" [...] as highlights. Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal website declared Gaga as a [...] "pop muse" [...] for the performances. He complimented the choice of songs in the set list calling them [...] "eclectic" [...] and felt they [...] "displayed different sides to her craft". He noticed that the singer's vocal abilities were particularly prominent during the acoustic performances on piano. Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone observed that the compact space of Roseland did not allow for much choreography, but felt Gaga's performance was [...] "magical", especially during [...] "You and I".|$|E

Terri Schwartz of Zap2it also gave a particularly positive review, praising both the connections to the films, including Jackson's cameo, and the internal development of the show, namely that of the character Skye and the team as a whole. Dan Casey of Nerdist called [...] "0-8-4" [...] "a strong second episode, [...] managed to course-correct from some of the missteps of the pilot". He praised the [...] "solid mix of action, character development, and humor" [...] and concluded that the episode was [...] "genuinely enjoyable television". Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.5 out of 10, comparing it positively to The A-Team and Indiana Jones, praising its self-awareness, Jackson's cameo, and the development of Coulson's character, but criticizing the lack of development for the other characters, specifically Fitz and Simmons.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} received. Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry called the second season's opening [...] "a bloody winner" [...] {{and said that}} Hall's performance [...] "remains a towering achievement". IGN's Eric Goldman thought that the episode's biggest problem was [...] "having to follow up such a great first season", but called [...] "It's Alive!" [...] "a solid episode". He praised Dexter's flashbacks and Dexter and Debra's storylines, though he said that Doakes' following Dexter was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that LaGuerta's overhearing Lt. Esmee Pascal's private conversation was [...] "a bit contrived". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad [...] "love the flashbacks to a young Dexter and living Harry". Regarding the episode's end, he wrote that [...] "just as Dexter's heart beats out of his chest, as does ours." [...] Paula Paige, writing for TV Guide, said that the episode [...] "made for some exciting, heart-pounding fear" [...] and called the discovery of Dexter's corpses [...] "a fantastic storyline". She commended Benz for [...] "develop her character, Rita, into a person instead of just the shell of one she appeared to be". Blogcritics Ray Ellis commented, [...] "If [...] <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> Dexters second season looks to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters. It certainly sets up a number of plot complexities [...] and new devices that offer a myriad of new developments." [...] The A.V.

500|$|Prior to {{the season}} premieres of most {{television}} series in September, a common practice by television networks would be to send screeners of pilots of new shows to critics. On August 18, The CW notified critics {{that they would not}} be releasing the premiere episodes, saying, [...] " [...] have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere. We're not hiding anything... simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9.02, riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night, and letting all our constituents see it at the same time." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the decision was an indication of the low quality of the episodes, but pointed out that the pilot may not have been finished in time for a screener release, which was later confirmed to be the case. Despite not having watched the episode, the Parents Television Council said in a statement that [...] "if Gossip Girl <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> of what 90210 will look like, advertisers have plenty of reason to steer clear of the show... No reputable advertiser should even consider sponsoring the show without viewing the content in advance." [...] "We're Not in Kansas Anymore", along with the following episode, averaged 4.9 million viewers throughout the two-hour broadcast on September 2. This gave The CW its highest-rated premiere ever in the adults 18-49 demographic with a 2.6. By comparison, the series finale of the original series was watched by 25 million viewers on its original broadcast in May 2000.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] an [...] "A+." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "one {{of those}} deliciously dense episodes {{in which the}} nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue" [...] and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be [...] "sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments" [...] by the series' May 2010 end. [...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E

There are no crocodiles with clocks in their stomachs, or literary silver slippers (to contrast with cinematic ruby ones), or tiny bottles that say “drink me.” Instead, basically, there is one movie. A massive, record-breaking blockbuster, to be sure, but a single screen outing does not produce a relatively rich mythology from which to pull. [...] If the season four premiere (and all the promos for it) <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication,</b> this season will be Frozen-centric, and story supply is already running low.
