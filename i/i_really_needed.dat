[...] In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with You Don't Love Me Yet, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life".

2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities.

[...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times.

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy.

I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The first single, [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", Tisdale said, [...] "is a strong, {{empowering}} {{song that}} kind of helps you move on" [...] and continued to say: I have definitely [...] on and with someone you really like, if they are cheating on you, you don't want to believe it. But, unfortunately, you either stay in the relationship and keep getting hurt because it keeps happening or you get up and you move on. You don't look back. Tisdale said the song [...] "Hot Mess" [...] is [...] "about hanging out with a motorcycle bad boy that makes life more interesting" [...] and the song [...] "How Do You Love Someone" [...] written by Porcelain Black (Alaina Beaton) is [...] "about a girl who deals with the split of her parents". Tisdale also said, the song could be about [...] "When you have been cheated on or you're in a relationship". Black was initially reluctant to let Tisdale record the song, but eventually green-lit the track. However, she recorded her RedOne-produced version which will feature guest vocals by Eminem for her upcoming debut album. Tisdale co-wrote several songs on the album such as [...] "What If", which was co-written with Kara DioGuardi. Tisdale described [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song on the album, she said the song [...] "is about when you’re in a relationship and you say 'If <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> you, would you actually be there?’" ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

6000|$|As we {{were walking}} along a {{carriage}} came up after us, in which were two ladies. A bunch of primroses, thrown from this carriage, fell at my feet. I picked it up, and then the carriage stopped, and the ladies requested to know if I was Mrs. Stowe. On answering in the affirmative, they urged me so earnestly to come under their roof and take some refreshment, that I began to remember, what I had partly lost sight of, that I was very tired; so, {{while the rest of}} the party walked on to get a distant view of Ben Lomond, Mr. S. and I suffered ourselves to be taken into the carriage of our unknown friends, and carried up to a charming little Italian villa, which stood, surrounded by flower gardens and pleasure grounds, at the head of the loch. We were ushered into a most comfortable parlor, where a long window, made of one clear unbroken sheet of plate glass, gave a perfect view of the loch with all its woody shores, with Roseneath Castle in the distance. My good hostesses literally overwhelmed me with kindness; but as there was nothing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> so much as a little quiet rest, they took me to a cozy bedroom, of which they gave me the freedom, for the present.

Also, my native air was every day more unhealthy for me, [...] {{and it was time}} I should seriously think of a change of climate.

Add to this, I had become [...] acquainted with an old Berlin Justizrath, who had spent many years in [...] the fortress of Spandau, and he related to me how unpleasant it is [...] when one is obliged to wear irons in winter. For myself I thought it [...] very unchristian that the irons were not warmed a trifle. If the [...] irons were warmed a little for us they would not make so unpleasant [...] an impression, and even chilly natures might then bear them very [...] well; it would be only proper consideration, too, if the fetters were [...] perfumed with essence of roses and laurels, {{as is the case in}} this [...] country (France).

60|$|I drove cityward {{through the}} rain, {{mechanically}} taking the familiar {{turns in the}} road, barely missing {{a man in a}} buggy at a four-corners. He shouted after me, but the world to which he belonged didn't exist. I lived again those moments that had followed Nancy's surrender, seeking to recall and fix in my mind every word that had escaped from her lips--the trivial things that to lovers are so fraught with meaning. I lived it all over again, as I say, but the reflection of it, though intensely emotional, differed from the reality in that now I was somewhat able to regard the thing, to regard myself, objectively; to define certain feelings that had flitted in filmy fashion through my consciousness, delicate shadows I recognized at the time as related to sadness. When she had so amazingly yielded, the thought for which my mind had been vaguely groping was that the woman who lay there in my arms, obscured by the darkness, was not Nancy at all! It was as if this one precious woman I had so desperately pursued had, in the capture, lost her identity, had mysteriously become just woman, in all her significance, yes, and helplessness. The particular had merged (inevitably, I might have known) into the general: the temporary had become the lasting, with a chain of consequences vaguely implied that even in my joy gave me pause. For {{the first time in my}} life I had a glimpse of what marriage might mean,--marriage in a greater sense than I had ever conceived it, a sort of cosmic sense, implying obligations transcending promises and contracts, calling for greatness of soul of a kind I had not hitherto imagined. Was there in me a grain of doubt of my ability to respond to such a high call? I began to perceive that such a union as we contemplated involved more obligations than one not opposed to traditional views of morality. I fortified myself, however,--if indeed <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> fortification in a mood prevailingly triumphant and exalted,--with the thought that this love was different, the real thing, the love of maturity steeped in the ideals of youth. Here was a love for which I must be prepared to renounce other things on which I set a high value; prepared, in case the world, for some reason, should not look upon us with kindliness. It was curious that such reflections as these should have been delayed until after the achievement of my absorbing desire, more curious that they should have followed so closely on the heels of it. The affair had shifted suddenly from a basis of adventure, of uncertainty; to one of fact, of commitment; I am exaggerating my concern in order to define it; I was able to persuade myself without much difficulty that these little, cloudy currents in the stream of my joy were due to a natural reaction from the tremendous strain of the past weeks, mere morbid fancies.|$|E
