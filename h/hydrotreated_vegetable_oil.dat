25|$|Green diesel is {{produced}} through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Hydrocracking is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and {{pressure in the}} presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules, such as those found in vegetable oils, into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It may also be called renewable diesel, <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel. Green diesel has the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel. It does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use, but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. Gasoline versions are also being developed. Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips, Neste Oil, Valero, Dynamic Fuels, and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg, Sweden, creating what is known as Evolution Diesel.|$|E

The results indicate that soot oxidation is very similar between the studied fuels. This is supported by the obtained HR-TEM images and EELS-spectra which were practically indistinguishable between different fuels and engine conditions.

50|$|This diesel is {{blended with}} petrodiesel. A market is created because the European Union {{required}} 5.75% of transport fuels should be biofuels by 2010. The EU further decided on 18 December 2008, that by 2020, {{the share of}} energy from renewable sources in all forms of transportation be at least 10% of the final consumption of energy. Systems and regions without an electrical grid will be the long-term market for <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> as the EU prefers electrical use by factor 2.5. In the Helsinki area, the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council and the Helsinki City Transport conducted a three-year experiment by running buses with 25% Neste Renewable Diesel at first, and then switching to 100% in 2008. The trial, which was the largest field test of a biofuel produced from renewable raw materials worldwide, was a success: local emissions were decreased significantly, with particle emissions decreased by 30% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 10%, with excellent winter performance and no problems with catalytic converters. Since then, Helsinki buses have run on Neste Renewable Diesel.|$|R
50|$|Algae {{can be used}} {{to produce}} 'green diesel' (also known as {{renewable}} diesel, <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel) through a hydrotreating refinery process that breaks molecules down into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It has the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel meaning that it does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use. It has yet to be produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. While hydrotreating is currently the most common pathway to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarboxylation/decarbonylation, there is an alternative process offering a number of important advantages over hydrotreating. In this regard, the work of Crocker et al. and Lercher et al. is particularly noteworthy. For oil refining, research is underway for catalytic conversion of renewable fuels by decarboxylation. As the oxygen is present in crude oil at rather low levels, of the order of 0.5%, deoxygenation in petroleum refining is not of much concern, and no catalysts are specifically formulated for oxygenates hydrotreating. Hence, one of the critical technical challenges to make the hydrodeoxygenation of algae oil process economically feasible is related to the research and development of effective catalysts.|$|R
40|$|This {{domestic}} project, Future Combustion Technology for Synthetic and Renewable Fuels in Compression Ignition Engines (ReFuel), {{was part}} of a Collaborative Task "Future Combustion Technology for Synthetic and Renewable Fuels in Transport" of International Energy Agency (IEA) Combustion Agreement. This international Collaborative Task is coordinated by Finland. The three-year (2009 - 2011) project was a joint research project with Aalto University (Aalto), Tampere University of Technology (TUT), Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) and Åbo Akademi University (ÅAU). The project was funded by TEKES, Wärtsilä Oyj, Neste Oil Oyj, Agco Sisu Power, Aker Arctic Technology Oy and the research partners listed above. Modern renewable diesel fuels have excellent physical and chemical properties, in comparison to traditional crude oil based fuels. Purely paraffinic fuels do not contain aromatic compounds and they are totally sulphur free. <b>Hydrotreated</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Oil</b> (HVO) was studied as an example of paraffinic high cetane number (CN) diesel fuels. HVO has no storage and low temperature problems like the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) have. The combustion properties are better than those of crude oil based fuels and FAME, because they have very high cetane numbers and contain no polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). With low HVO density, viscosity and distillation temperatures, these advantageous properties allow far more advanced combustion strategies, such as very high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates or extreme Miller timings, than has been possible with current fossil fuels. The implementation of these advanced combustion technologies, together with the novel renewable diesel fuel, brought significant nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) emission reductions with no efficiency losses. The objective of ReFuel project was to develop new extremely low emission combustion technologies for new renewable fuels in compression ignition engines. The target was to decrease emissions at least by 70 %. The scope was to utilize the physical and chemical properties of the renewable fuels that differ from properties of the traditional crude oil based fuels and to develop optimum combustion technologies for them. The project focused firstly, on paraffinic high cetane number fuels i. e. <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> fuel as a typical representative of this kind of fuel and secondly, on fuels with high content of oxygenates. This was implemented by blending oxygenate to HVO fuel. ﻿...|$|E

Afterwards, the effects of a biofuel blend usage on brake specific fuel consumption and on exhaust emissions were also evaluated at 7 different part load operating conditions, representative of the New European Driving Cycle.

40|$|On {{behalf of}} vehicle and engine {{manufacturers}} {{from around the}} world, the Worldwide Fuel Charter Committee is pleased to present the Fifth Edition of the Worldwide Fuel Charter. The Charter was first established in 1998 to increase understanding of the fuel quality needs of motor vehicle and engine technologies and to promote fuel quality harmonisation worldwide in accordance with those needs. Importantly, the Charter matches fuel specifications to the vehicle and engine specifications required to meet various customer needs around the world. The Fifth Edition introduces Category 5 for markets with highly advanced requirements for emission control and fuel efficiency. As many countries take steps to require vehicles and engines to meet strict fuel economy standards in addition to stringent emission standards, Category 5, which raises the minimum research octane number (RON) to 95, will enable some gasoline technologies that can help increase vehicle and engine efficiency.

The article attempts to rank the environmental performance {{and costs of}} fuel and feedstock combinations. Due to inter-study differences in goal and study assumptions, the ranking was mostly qualitative and intra-study results are emphasized. Results indicate that HVO made from wastes or by-products such as tall oil, tallow or used cooking oil outperform transesterified lipids and BTL from woody material, both with respect to environmental life cycle impacts and costs. These feedstock options are, however, of limited availability, and to produce larger volumes of biofuels other raw materials must also be used. BTL from woody biomass seems promising with good environmental performance and the ability not to compete with food production. Production of biofuels from agricultural feedstock sources requires much energy and leads to considerable emissions due to agrochemical inputs. Thus, such biodiesel fuels are ranked lowest in this comparison. Production of feedstock {{is the most important}} life cycle stage.

The two blending stocks were a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel derived from canola oil and a renewable diesel blending component (biodiesel-B) obtained by <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil.</b> Compatibility tests indicated that petroleum ULSD and specific biofuels are compatible with each other at any blending ratio. Fouling tests suggested that, for all the diesel blends, the fouling propensity was very low level. Thermal stability tests-fuel thermal oxidation test (JFTOT), breakpoint temperature, oxidation stability, induction time, and peroxide number-indicated that the renewable diesel and biodiesel blends with ULSD have good thermal stability. However, stability consequences of different fuel samples can be described as: ULSD > Biodiesel-B B 5 > Biodiesel-B B 20 > FAME B 5 > FAME B 20. The fouling observed in HCCI engine operation could be caused by the heating configuration used in engine design combined with temperature and oxygen levels.

The challenges with first generation biofuels such as ethanol and vegetable oil-derived fuels are well known. The two main issues commonly aired are the food versus energy debate and the costs of production. The region however offers important advantages not available elsewhere that allows one to reconsider these alternative fuel candidates. These include favourable climate and the apparent availability of marginal land where feedstock such as jatropha and pongamia can thrive. Recent technological advantages in fuel conversion is now stimulating new interest in the potential of these biofuels for the region.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of radioactive solutions containing organic or aggressive media may cause stability problems in liquid and plastic scintillation (PS) techniques. In {{the case of}} PS, this can be overcome by adding a crosslinker to the polymer structure. The objectives {{of this study are}} to synthesise a suitable crosslinked plastic scintillator (C-PS) for radioactivity determination in organic and aggressive media. The results indicated that an increase in the crosslinker content reduces the detection efficiency and a more flexible crosslinker yields higher detection efficiency. For the polymer composition studied, 2, 5 -diphenyloxazole (PPO) is the most adequate fluorescent solute and an increase in its concentration causes little change in the detection efficiency. The inclusion of a secondary fluorescent solute 1, 4 -bis- 2 -(5 -phenyloxazolyl) benzene (POPOP) improves the C-PS radiometrical characteristics. For the final composition chosen, the synthesis of the C-PS exhibits good reproducibility with elevated yield.

However, a number of successful developments are still necessary before algae can reach commercial applications.

FUEL 4 ME is developing and demonstrating an integrated and sustainable process for continuous biofuel production from microalgae, and making the algae-based biofuels (HVO) competitive alternatives to fossil fuels and to contribute to a future BioEconomy. The big challenge for the future large scale and commercial production of algae for transportation biofuels within a BioEconomy is the up-scaling from demo size to commercial size. Therefore a modelling “Algae_Upscale 1. 0 ” of the FUEL 4 ME process is done for specific parameters (technical, economic, environmental), which are most relevant for the up-scaling of the process; furthermore the modelling results in a framework for a sustainable future commercial HVO production from microalgae. This modelling approach includes the methodologies of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). Different cases with a production size of 100 kt/a HVO and coproducing PUFA are modelled, as the future commercial algae biofuel production needs huge volumes to receive significance on the energy market.

40|$|AbstractResearch in Advanced Biofuels {{steadily}} {{developed during}} recent years. A number of highly innovative technologies have been explored at various scale: among these, lignocellulosic ethanol and CTO (Crude Tall Oil) -biofuel technologies already achieved the early-commercial status, while <b>hydrotreating</b> of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> (HVO, or HEFA) {{can be considered}} today fully commercial. However, despite the level of innovation in each specific technological process under consideration, the feedstock maintains {{a central role in}} making a biofuel chain really sustainable. In this context, microalgae grown in salt-water and arid areas offers a considerable opportunity for advanced biofuel production: at the same time, however, they also represent a considerable challenge. Processing microalgae in an economic way into a viable and sustainable liquid biofuel (a low-cost mass-produced product) is not trivial. So far, the main attention has been given to cultivating the microorganism, accumulating lipids, extracting the oil, valorising co-products, and treating the algae oil into biodiesel (through esterification) or HEFA (Hydrotreated Esthers and Fatty Acids), this second one representing a very high quality biofuels, almost a drop-in fuel (suitable either for road transport or for aviation), which production exceed 2 Mt y- 1 today. However, extracting the algae oil at low cost and at industrial scale is not yet a full industrial mature process, and the still limited market size of algae-to-biofuels makes difficult the development of industrial-scale systems. Nevertheless, another option can be considered, i. e. processing the whole algae into dedicated thermochemical reactors, thus approaching the downstream processing of algae in a completely different way from separation. The present work examines the possible routes for thermochemical conversion of microalgae, distinguishing between dry-processes (namely pyrolysis and gasification) and wet-processes (near critical water hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal gasification). Typical expected elementary composition of major products is given. Main peculiarities of batch versus continuous processing are also discussed from an engineering point of view. Major engineering advantages and challenges in thermochemically conversion of algae are identified and discussed, in view of the production of a transport biofuel.

One very promising equivalent to mineral diesel fuel is <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (HVO) as it is highly paraffinic and offers similar combustion characteristics. This fuel offer the potential of not requiring further engine hardware modification together with correspondingly lower exhaust gas emissions and better fuel consumption than mineral diesel.

40|$|Heavy {{alcohols}} can {{be mixed}} with fossil diesel to produce blended fuels {{that can be}} used in diesel engines. Alcohols can be obtained from fossil resources, but can also be produced more sustainably from renewable raw materials. The use of such biofuels can help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector. This study examines four alcohol/diesel blends each containing one heavy alcohol: n-butanol, iso-butanol, 2 -ethyl hexanol and n-octanol. All of the blends where prepared to function as drop-in fuels in existing engines with factory settings. To compensate for the alcohols′ low cetane numbers (CN), a third component with high CN was added to each blend, namely <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (HVO). The composition of each mixture was selected to give an overall CN equal to that of fossil diesel fuel. The four blends were compared in terms of sustainability, their performance in engine tests using a single-cylinder light duty engine, and their general physicochemical properties. Lifecycle analyses indicated that replacing fossil diesel with diesel-biofuel blends could reduce GHG emissions by between 22 and 58 %. The greatest reduction was predicted to occur with the isobutanol containing blend and the second greatest with the 2 -ethylhexanol blend. Analysis of the blends' physical properties showed that the ones including octanol isomers resemble fossil diesel more closely than those containing butanol. Engine experiments indicated that the blends' combustion behavior and thermal efficiencies were very similar to those of conventional diesel fuel. However, on average, the blends produced approximately 50 % less soot than diesel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVegetable Oil (VO) {{is today}} the most used {{feedstock}} for transport biofuel production by transesterification to biodiesel. Other commercial technologies for renewable fuels production are mainly based either on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis from coal, {{natural gas and}} possibly biomass, or hydro treating of vegetable oil (<b>Hydrotreated</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Oil,</b> HVO) : this also includes Hydrotreated Renewable Jet fuel, HRJ, Used Cooking Oil (UCO) is a highly sustainable feedstock (based on EC-RED scheme) : it is therefore considered as a possible alternative to VOs for greening of air transport and, under proper circumstances, for reducing the feedstock cost component. However, the use of UCO is not trivial in reactors, as catalysts are sensitive to impurities and contaminations, which are typical of waste oils. Moreover, the chemical composition of UCO is variable regionally as well as seasonally, because the type of base-vegetable oils vary with Country and period of the year. In {{the framework of the}} ITAKA EU FP 7 project, (catalytic) thermochemical conversion of UCO has been considered to obtain an intermediate biofuel suitable for upgrading by hydrotreating. The catalytic conversion of UCO and Fatty Acids were investigated in a 1. 5 kg/h pilot unit. UCO, properly filtered and conditioned, was characterized, and then converted in bio-oil by means of thermal and catalytic reactionsunder controlled conditions. The type of catalyst and the reaction conditions, including several parameters such as temperature, reactor geometry, heating rate and residence time, were evaluated, and selected combinations were tested. The bio-oil was characterized in terms of main constituents and hydrocarbons content, and GC-MS and GC-FID analyses were used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the composition of the fuel...|$|E
40|$|Global warming {{driven by}} “greenhouse gas” {{emissions}} is an increasingly serious concern {{of both the}} public and legislators. A potentially potent way to reduce these emissions and conserve fossil fuel resources is to use n-butanol, iso-butanol or octanol (2 -ethylhexanol) from renewable sources as alternative fuels in diesel engines. The effects of adding these substances to diesel fuel were therefore tested in a single-cylinder heavy duty diesel engine operated using factory settings. These alcohols have better calorific values, flash points, lubricity, cetane numbers and solubility in diesel than shorter-chain alcohols. However, they have lower cetane numbers than diesel, so either <b>hydrotreated</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> (HVO) or Di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP) was added to the diesel-alcohol mixtures to generate blends with the same Cetane Number (CN) as diesel. Blends containing 10 and 20 % of n-butanol or iso-butanol, or 30 % octanol were tested at four operating points from the European Stationary Cycle. The same engine settings were used in all cases. The average engine performance in tests with the blends was similar to that achieved with pure diesel but the blends generated less cycle-to-cycle variation. The brake thermal efficiency was similar for all the fuels but the brake specific fuel consumption was slightly higher for the blends due to their lower calorific value. Because of their oxygen content, the blends produced much lower emissions of soot and carbon monoxide than were achieved with diesel. Blends yielded slightly higher NOx emissions than pure diesel and all the fuels produced similar hydrocarbon emissions. Possibly because of its branched molecular structure, the iso-butanol blends yielded slightly higher soot emissions than the n-butanol blends. Because HVO contains no aromatics, its addition to fuel blends reduced soot emissions. Overall, these results confirm the substantial potential of renewable longer-chain alcohols as components of blended diesel fuels...|$|E
