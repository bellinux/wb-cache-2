5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{difference}} in tone between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E

5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

25|$|Being a {{derivative}} of the morna, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> that the coladeira shares some characteristics with the former, as the harmonic sequence, the verse structure and a varied and syncopated melodic line.

The answer is provided by Belyi's theorem, which states that the Riemann surfaces that can be described by dessins are precisely those that {{can be defined as}} algebraic curves over the field of algebraic numbers. The absolute Galois group transforms these particular curves into each other, and thereby also transforms the underlying dessins.|$|E

25|$|Real {{analysis}} {{is an area}} of analysis that studies concepts such as sequences and their limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real analysis focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line. Real {{analysis is}} closely related to complex analysis, which studies broadly the same properties of complex numbers. In complex analysis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> to define differentiation via holomorphic functions, which have a number of useful properties, such as repeated differentiability, expressability as power series, and satisfying the Cauchy integral formula.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of raw feeding {{believe that}} the natural diet of raw meat, bones, and organs is nutritionally {{superior}} to cooked meat and commercial pet food. They argue that a careful plan of a raw diet gives the animal numerous health benefits, including a healthier coat and cleaner teeth and elimination of bad breath. Critics of raw feeding assert {{that the risk of}} nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and foodborne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently better because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E

In a large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the interest of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses are of less extent, and of course are less protected.|$|E
25|$|John Stacpoole, Mason's biographer, made {{a careful}} {{comparison}} of his architecture against his peers', {{and found him}} superior to most of his contemporaries. This seems reasonable, although of his strict contemporaries there were relatively few in New Zealand and fewer still when Mason made his greatest contribution after his move to Dunedin. There <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> to measure him against younger men such as R.A. Lawson (1833–1902) and Francis Petre (1847–1918), both acknowledged eminences among New Zealand's Victorian architects. Mason's active career did overlap Lawson's, though scarcely Petre's, but the comparison is somewhat skewed because these practitioners represented significantly different moments of architectural thought. In terms {{of the volume of}} his output, and that of his successive partnerships, Mason made a significant impact. As a professional he was highly regarded, a senior figure people turned to for advice on difficult matters. But in the Post Office, or Stock Exchange, he designed the first building in New Zealand of more than local distinction. Were it not for its neglect and demise he would now be recalled as the country's first significant architect.|$|E
25|$|Early {{molluscs}} {{appear to}} have grazed on microbial mats, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>natural</b> to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where the mats could survive. The earliest known fossils of monoplacophoran ("single-plated") molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft subtrates in deep parts of the seas, although one genus lives on hard substrates {{at the edges of}} continental shelves. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately the oldest known fossils of polyplacophorans (molluscs with multiple shell plates) are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with stromatolites (stubby pillars built by some types of microbial mat colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea. No fossils have been found of aplacophorans (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps.|$|E
