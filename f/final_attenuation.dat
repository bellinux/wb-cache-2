40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of research on the use of barley caryopses hardness for prediction of the malting quality. Grain hardness was determined by three methods: Particle size index (PSI), hardness according to Brabender (BRA) and grain milling energy (GME). The correlations among methods for determining the kernel hardness were estimated as well among selected technological traits of barley and malt and kernel hardness. Significant correlations were found among PSI values and <b>Final</b> <b>attenuation</b> of laboratory wort from malt (0. 73 *) a Glycidic extract (0. 70 *). Values of kernel hardness measured by BRA significantly correlated with <b>Final</b> <b>attenuation</b> of laboratory wort from malt (– 0. 80 *) and Soluble nitrogen of malt (0. 64 *). Grain milling energy values were statistically significant correlated with Nitrogen content in malt (0. 64 *).

30|$|Four {{different}} pellets {{with different}} expected amounts of metal artifact influence in abovementioned positions {{were chosen for}} <b>final</b> analysis. <b>Attenuation</b> deviation reflects the difference in HU values with and without the insertion of a prosthesis. Pellet L 5 was categorized as ‘light disturbance’, L 6 as ‘medium disturbance’ and pellet L 8 as ‘heavy disturbance’ based on visual assessment (Fig. 3). No disturbance is expected in pellet R 0 and L 0 due to its location in the phantom. The HU values of the pellets after prosthesis placement were compared to the corresponding pellets from the scan of the phantom without prosthesis. The effectivity of O-MAR in artefact reduction was analyzed for each of abovementioned categories of disturbance.|$|R
40|$|The use of some Portuguese clay {{materials}} as alternative low-cost adsorbents, {{as well as}} substrates to immobilize titania for decolouring methylene blue (MB) and orange II (OII) dye solutions, was studied. For MB adsorption studies, the experimental data were mathematically fitted using Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. The clayey materials showed distinct adsorption behaviour. The dye removal was high {{with the use of}} the bentonite-rich sample collected on the Benevila region (AV), the other illitic-kaolinitic (OV) and kaolinitic (BA) presented lower efficiency. The studied clays were not capable to adsorb OII dye molecules, due to their anionic character. The removal of OH was improved by using photocatalysis, testing new clay/titania composites prepared by mixing distinct proportions of each component Decolouring of OII solutions reached acceptable levels (between 94 - 80 %), but the materials are less efficient than pure commercial TiO 2 powder. Concerning MB solutions, the combined effect of adsorption and photocatalysis resulted in very satisfactory performances, even for mixtures containing relatively low content of TiO 2 catalyst By testing titania gel impregnated clays, high OII decolouration efficiency (up to 99 %) is obtained in short time (2 h). However, the decolouration of MB solutions by these materials was much slower (20 h) although the <b>final</b> colour <b>attenuation</b> reached 96. 5 %. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Parasitic {{elements}} hidden into {{passive components}} and added by PCB tracks make {{the design of}} EMI filters a difficult task. Gaining control of such parasitic components can enhance the overall filter performance as well as improve the accuracy of the <b>final</b> <b>attenuation</b> prediction. In this paper, a practical method for achieving inductance cancellation in filter capacitors featuring high flexibility and, at the same time, high repeatability is proposed. Thanks to the complete shielding of the coreless coupled windings the cancellation effect is not affected by ground plane proximity, providing constant equivalent parameter values. Moreover, the shield can be helpful to reduce the mutual coupling between different components of the same filter, thus enhancing the overall filter attenuation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by extensive experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{calculation}} of jet quenching and its azimuthal anisotropy {{in the high}} energy AA and high multiplicity pA and dA collisions. The {{purpose of this study}} is twofold. First, we improve our previous event-by-event studies, by properly implementing p_t dependence in the modeling. We show that, within the jet "monography" scenario featuring a strong near-Tc-enhancement of jet energy loss, the computed high-p_t nuclear modification factor R_AA and the harmonic coefficients in its azimuthal anisotropy v_ 2, 3, 4, agree well with the available data from both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Second, in light of current discussions on possible final state collective behavior in the high-multiplicity pPb and dAu collisions, we examine the implication of <b>final</b> state jet <b>attenuation</b> in such collisions, by applying the same model used in AA collisions and quantifying the corresponding R_pA and R_dA and their azimuthal anisotropy. The high-p_t V_n provide a set of clean indicators of final state energy loss. In particular we find in the most central pPb (5. 02 TeV) and dAu (200 GeV) collisions, V_ 2 is on the order of 0. 01 and 0. 1 respectively, measurable with current experimental accuracy. In addition, our high-p_t R_dA is around 0. 6 which is compatible with preliminary dAu results from RHIC.

40|$|Barley is {{the second}} oldest cereal after wheat, which began to be cultivated. The area, which was sown with barley in 2015 {{amounted}} to nearly 366, 000 hectares, which was by 15 thousand hectares {{more than in the}} previous year. These numbers indicate that even nowadays it is an important and attractive crop. The aim of my thesis was to study the influence of treating of malt barley varieties Francin by low temperature plasma to technological quality malting barley. It has been evaluated several parameters. Parameters achieved the following results: turbidity 12 ° (10, 68 12, 15 %) and 90 ° (8, 86 9, 56 %), the viscosity of 8. 6 % (1, 46 mPa), the pH of the wort (5, 57 - 5, 65), extract flour dry matter (78, 2 78, 6 %), relative extract at 45 ° C (31, 2 33, 4 %), the color of the wort (15, 5 16, 5 j.

40|$|Although beer {{refermentation}} {{in bottles}} {{is essentially a}} simple process, mixing mature beer with yeast and sugar before bottling, refermentation {{is often difficult to}} control in industrial practice. This can result in variable batch-to-batch quality, especially in small-scale breweries. In this study, industrial top-fermented beers were mixed with freshly propagated yeast and fermentable extract. The extract consisted of glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, or one of several commercially available sugar syrups. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were fermented at comparable rates, reaching <b>final</b> <b>attenuation</b> within two weeks. Maltose was only partially fermented or not fermented at all, depending mainly on the yeast strain used. Several factors that may affect sugar uptake were examined. Carbon dioxide pressure in the bottled beer accounted for most of the loss in the capacity of the yeast to ferment maltose, while it had only a minor influence on the uptake of glucose and fructose. This difference is probably due to the different mechanisms by which these sugars are transported into the cell. Although maltose is the main sugar in brewing wort, its use is not appropriate for bottle refermentation. The use of sugar syrups with high maltose content may lead to irreproducible or stuck fermentations. Moreover, residual extract promotes inconsistent yeast deposit stability. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Fermentation time in {{the cellar}} {{directly}} affects potential brewery production as a whole. It is of practical interest to decrease time needed where possible and increase efficiency. Decreased lag time in beer fermentations allow for higher production and efficiency in the brewery as well as decreased risk of contamination. This study examined the use of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) as a nutrient supplement to stimulate yeast growth during fermentation. Small-scale (1 L), stirred fermentations were carried out at 15 °C using a German lager yeast in a lightly hopped 11 °P wort made from 70 % pale 2 -row malt and 30 % high glucose liquid adjunct. Two pitching rates were examined, 1 x 106 and 1 x 105 cell/ml⋅°P, and four levels of MSM (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 075 % w/w). Fermentation gravity and viable cell counts were monitored throughout fermentation until the <b>final</b> <b>attenuation</b> was achieved (approximately 5 days). The application of 0. 25 % w/w MSM resulted in the shortest lag time in both adequately (1 x 106 cell/ml⋅°P) and under-pitched (1 x 105 cell/ml⋅°P) ferments. Additionally, this treatment reached stable, maximum cell counts and final gravity the quickest. Increased concentrations of MSM trended with higher terminal gravities and lower fermentability irrespective of pitching rate. Application of MSM to beer fermentations {{has the potential to}} decreased lag time and increase peak rate in beer fermentations...|$|E
40|$|For {{quantitative}} tracer {{distribution in}} positron emission tomography, attenuation correction is essential. In a hybrid PET/CT system the CT images {{serve as a}} basis for generation of the attenuation map, but in PET/MR, the MR images do not have a similarly simple relationship with the attenuation map. Hence attenuation correction in PET/MR systems is more challenging. Typically either of two MR sequences are used: the Dixon or the ultra-short time echo (UTE) techniques. However these sequences have some well-known limitations. In this study, a reconstruction technique based on a modified and optimized non-TOF MLAA is proposed for PET/MR brain imaging. The idea is to tune the parameters of the MLTR applying some information from an attenuation image computed from the UTE sequences and a T 1 w MR image. In this MLTR algorithm, an [Formula: see text] parameter is introduced and optimized in order to drive the algorithm to a <b>final</b> <b>attenuation</b> map most consistent with the emission data. Because the non-TOF MLAA is used, a technique to reduce the cross-talk effect is proposed. In this study, the proposed algorithm is compared to the common reconstruction methods such as OSEM using a CT attenuation map, considered as the reference, and OSEM using the Dixon and UTE attenuation maps. To show the robustness and the reproducibility of the proposed algorithm, a set of 204 [(18) F]FDG patients, 35 [(11) C]PiB patients and 1 [(18) F]FET patient are used. The results show that by choosing an optimized value of [Formula: see text] in MLTR, the proposed algorithm improves the results compared to the standard MR-based attenuation correction methods (i. e. OSEM using the Dixon or the UTE attenuation maps), and the cross-talk and the scale problem are limited. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{gluten-free}} beer is {{not produced}} in Hungary for coeliacs. The goal {{of our research}} was to develop brewery products made of domestically grown millet (Alföldi 1) and buckwheat (Oberon) {{that are similar to}} traditional beer of barley malt regarding taste, aroma, consistency, colour, foam stability and alcohol content. On a micromalting equipment malts were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with decoction process (mashing program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, FAN, colour, bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a <b>final</b> <b>attenuation</b> of 61. 5 % and 73. 2 %. In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC.

Inhibiting effect of certain substances on proteolytic enzymes was investigated by measuring the extract, FAN, and soluble nitrogen contents. Inhibition was detected in case of both raw materials, although to a different extent. Inhibition is influenced by tannins and polyphenols found in the grain (Chethan et al., 2008) ...|$|E
