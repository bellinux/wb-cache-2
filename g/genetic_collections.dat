50|$|The Germplasm Resources Unit {{houses a}} {{diverse range of}} seed collections, {{accounting}} for more than 20,000 accessions. The seeds are stored in a special low temperature, low humidity facility and {{a complete list of}} accessions {{can be found in the}} GRU's database SeedStor, which was released at the end of 2014. The oldest collection kept in GRU is the Watkins Landrace Wheat Collection, which has a variety of wheat landraces cultivars acquired by A.E. Watkins in the 1930s from 32 different countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. Because the samples were collected before modern Plant Breeding efforts and the Green revolution, it is a very interesting source of genetic variability for novel agronomic trait discovery. The collection was screened in 2014 by John Innes Centre researchers, and a great level of genetic diversity was found.The BBSRC Small Grain Cereal Collection is the largest in the UK and originated from a series of working collections from different plant breeding and research institutes from the UK. The collection was produced alongside public sector breeding programmes, and has the potential to be a source of important traits regarding disease, pest and stress resistance.GRU also houses a Pisum collection, all of the elite varieties that are registered in the UK National Listing, and several specialist <b>genetic</b> <b>collections,</b> such as near-isogenic lines, TILLING collections, precise genetic stocks, mapping populations, host differentials for disease testing and variant collections developed and targeted at the research and breeding communities.|$|E

The genes {{to be introduced}} were located on the specific chromosome and mapped to linkage maps using aneuploid stocks of LD 222 and Langdon, Landgdon D-genome chromosome substitution lines, and microsatellite markers. We contributed mapping of the genes for long glumes on chromosomes 7 AL and 7 BL, genes for brittle rachis on chromosomes 3 AS and 3 BS and the gene for ligulelessness on chromosome 2 BL. The mutant gene for sphaerococcoid grain, s 16219, was allelic to S 2, which was located on the centromeric region of chromosome 3 B in hexaploid wheat. The gene for compact spike, C 17648 was located on the chromosome 5 AL. Near-isogenic lines were developed for the GA-sensitive Rht genes, Rht 14, Rht 16 and Rht 18, on chromosome 6 AS. The multiple alleles at the Rht-B 1 locus were introduced to cv. LD 222. Triticum polonicum IC 12196 may be considered as new source of reduced height genes. Forty-one near-isogenic lines were developed. Twenty-nine donors of genes were from tetraploid wheat collection for near-isogenic lines, and 12 were from hexaploid wheat accessions for near-isogenic lines.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore how the demand of germplasm held by CGIAR genebanks changed over time in order to assess the possible influence of the 1994 In Trust Agreements on germplasm demand. The proposed theoretic model motivates the realistic hypothesis that the consequences of the In-Trust Agreements lead to an enhancement of CGIAR germplasm utilization. Therefore the paper firstly examines the classical literature on biodiversity’s valuation and its recent developments and subsequently it investigates the origin of the agricultural biodiversity’s economic value, providing a basic conceptual framework to infer on factors determining the demand for germplasm. Two Bayesian estimation frameworks are applied to the IRRI accessions distribution’s time-series to provide formal evidence to the hypothesis, exploiting Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, Gibbs sampling in particular. Evidence suggests that the demand variation implies a change in the <b>genetic</b> <b>collections</b> economic value, impacting therefore on their direct use search value.

40|$|Future {{improvement}} of woody biomass {{crops such as}} willow and poplar relies on our ability to select for metabolic traits that sequester more atmospheric carbon into biomass, or into useful products to replace petrochemical streams. We describe the development of metabotyping screens for willow, using combined 1 D 1 H-NMR-MS. A protocol was developed to overcome 1 D 1 H-NMR spectral alignment problems caused by variable pH and peak broadening arising from high organic acid levels and metal cations. The outcome was a robust method to allow direct statistical comparison of profiles arising from source (leaf) and sink (stem) tissues allowing data to be normalised to a constant weight of the soluble metabolome. We also describe the analysis of two willow biomass varieties, demonstrating how fingerprints from 1 D 1 H-NMR-MS vary from the top {{to the bottom of}} the plant. Automated extraction of quantitative data of 56 primary and secondary metabolites from 1 D 1 H-NMR spectra was realised by the construction and application of a Salix metabolite spectral library using the Chenomx software suite. The optimised metabotyping screen in conjunction with automated quantitation will enable high-throughput screening of <b>genetic</b> <b>collections.</b> It also provides genotype and tissue specific data for future modelling of carbon flow in metabolic networks...|$|E
40|$|Biobanks pose unique {{challenges}} to legal and bioethical frameworks, and raise many as yet unanswered questions, including how these collections of biological samples and {{information should be}} governed and for whose benefit. While some commentators have suggested that biobanks should be regulated through specific legislation, I focus on exploring alternative models of governance. I examine, in particular, the interrelationship between benefit-sharing and public engagement, arguing that public engagement is a benefit in itself, valuable both {{in its own right}} and as an essential component of good governance, and critically examine proposals for more direct 'representative‘ forms of participant involvement and 'power-sharing‘ arrangements in the biobanking context. Central to my arguments is the concept of the "common heritage", which has been invoked by UNESCO and HUGO in relation to the human genome. From its early beginnings in the law of the sea, this concept has been linked to notions of solidarity, reciprocity and equitable access and sharing. Applied in the context of biobanks, the "common heritage" highlights the value of <b>genetic</b> <b>collections</b> and research for the benefit of present and future generations. Viewed as a third generation human right, the "common heritage" also links to notions of citizenship, civic involvement in policy processes and, ultimately, to participatory or deliberative democracy. From this, I suggest that robust biobank governance mechanisms require not only effective benefit-sharing arrangements but that these must necessarily involve provision for effective public engagement. Drawing on democratic and business management theory, I argue for a 'stakeholder' model of governance. This model draws its basic ideology from communitarian philosophy and regards any organisation (whether it be a corporation or a charity) as a 'social entity', accountable to a broad range of stakeholders. It is my contention that a stakeholder model is the most appropriate model of governance for large-scale population biobanks, such as UK Biobank, which are designed for public benefit, to enhance the health of all, including future generations. In sum, it is a model through which the common interest vested in biobank research might materialise...|$|E
40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of ways in which plant genetic {{resources}} are used in crop breeding programmes.

The introduction of this material into the breeding programs is largely dependent {{on the level of}} characterization. The genetic diversity and internal structure of Latvian and Swedish sweet and sour cherry <b>genetic</b> resources <b>collections</b> has been investigated using phenotypical characterization and evaluation in combination with SSR and self-incompatibility gene specific molecular markers. Phenotypical and molecular characterization revealed high phenotypic and genetic {{diversity of}} analysed germplasm as well as the relatedness of Baltic and Scandinavian sweet and especially sour cherry landraces which indicates a possible common historical origin. Local Baltic-Scandinavian cherry varieties were also differentiated from other cherry germplasm by the frequency of self-incompatibility alleles detected using gene specific molecular markers. Self-incompatibility allele information gained from this study will be also useful in breeding programmes for the planning of crosses and conservation of alleles. The use of different characterization methods of cherry genetic resources also facilitated methodological observations, applicable to cherry germplasm characterization. It was concluded that thorough evaluation of genetic diversity and internal structure of cherry <b>genetic</b> resources <b>collections</b> should include both phenotypic and molecular characterization. The information of genetic relatedness revealed by SSR markers did not show direct correspondence with the relatedness information detected by phenotypic characterization, regardless of the number of analysed markers.
