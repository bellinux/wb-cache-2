5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> it would show a stable +2 oxidation state {{as well as the}} +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|The Down Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of I-68 began in 1965 and continued for over 25years, with completion on August 2, 1991. While {{the road was}} under construction, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> economic conditions would improve along the corridor for the five counties connected by I-68: Allegany, Garrett, and Washington in Maryland, and Preston and Monongalia in West Virginia. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland. Although the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas, it provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides {{an alternative to the}} Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy {{difference between the two}} configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E

5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in {{some circles}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On {{occasion}} the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup {{was first}} {{televised}} in 1954 {{and is now}} the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> Brazil will bring in more than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as international standards on waste.|$|E
