The {{following day}} the same events happened; with both Shu officers retreating quickly. Again, Zhurong did not chase them, however, Wei Yan returned and hurled abuse at her. Enraged, she chased him, only to be led <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> valley where a trap lay waiting; entrapped in nets with her horse tripped by rope, Zhurong was ensnared.|$|E
25|$|Öland has a semi-continental {{oceanic climate}} with vast {{temperature}} differences between summer and winter. There {{are two main}} weather stations, one located at the northern edge and the other at the southern edge. In spite of the more northerly latitude, Öland's northern edge is far milder than its southern edge, since air warm over greater surrounding landmasses during days, whilst retaining heavy maritime features during night. It is also more representative for the island's general climate, with only the deep south being much cooler <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> peninsula.|$|E
25|$|At that time, New College Lane {{was known}} as Hammer Hall Lane (named after a hall to the east, as New College had not then been founded), and its {{northern}} side was the old town wall. The corner of Hammer Hall Lane and Catte Street (which had a postern in the wall called Smithgate) was taken by Black Hall, which was the place of John Wycliffe's imprisonment by the Vice-Chancellor around 1378. On {{the other side of}} Hart Hall along the lane was Shield Hall. On Catte Street itself was the entrance to Arthur Hall, which lay <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> passage behind Hart Hall, and Cat Hall (Aula Murilegorum), which stood further south, roughly where the Principal's Lodgings now stand.|$|E

25|$|The Death Star assault {{scene was}} {{modeled after the}} World War II film The Dam Busters (1955), in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended {{reservoirs}} and aim bouncing bombs at dams, in order to cripple the heavy industry of Germany's Ruhr region. Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters. In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by {{the climax of the}} film 633 Squadron (1964), directed by Walter Grauman, in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point, while avoiding anti-aircraft guns and German fighters. Clips from both films were included in Lucas's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{flanks of}} Starling Dodd are heavily wooded below 1,000ft, {{part of the}} extensive conifer plantations of the Ennerdale Forest. Within the forest is Latterbarrow (895ft), a parallel lower ridge which diverts some of Starling Dodd's streams further west than might be expected. North of the summit dome, Starling Dodd levels into a wide plateau before disappearing over a steep rim of minor crags. At the base of this fall is the tenuous topographical connection to Mellbreak, a low watershed dividing Starling Dodd's northern drainage into widely differing catchments. That {{to the west of}} the summit flows into the marshy valley of Mosedale, travelling all around Mellbreak to enter Crummock Water via Park Beck. The north-eastern quarter takes a direct line into the lake, dropping down the craggy face via Scale Force. This is believed to be the highest single waterfall in the District, dropping around 100ft <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> cleft.|$|E

500|$|The Warrior's Husband {{proved to}} be Hepburn's {{breakout}} performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the role was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production. The play opened March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews. Richard Garland of the New York World-Telegram wrote, [...] "It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene." ...|$|E
500|$|While Montgomery {{was making}} his advance, Arnold {{advanced}} with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at {{the northern end of}} the lower town. [...] They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected. [...] However, as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate, heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them. [...] The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward. They advanced <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade. [...] As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted, and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan. Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town. A British force of 500sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city. With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10am.|$|E
500|$|Unwilling {{to abandon}} her {{supporters}} within the Empire, the Empress {{demands that the}} Alliance march on the Begnion capital. However, as the now massive army prepares to depart, a messenger arrives from Daein demanding the surrender of the Empress to their custody {{on behalf of the}} senate. Realizing that they cannot advance with the threat of Daein to their north, the Alliance invades Daein. Micaiah and her army defend the border as long as possible, but are greatly outnumbered and are defeated. Suffering from battlefield fatigue, she returns to the capital to recover. While there she learns from King Pelleas of the true reason why they are fighting and resolves to fight on while the King researches a way to break the blood pact. The Daein army adopts increasingly unorthodox tactics, and through this are able to fight against the numerically superior Alliance. Their unshakable belief in Micaiah keeps the morale of the Daein soldiers high. In one engagement, Micaiah forces the Alliance to march <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> canyon road. She then employs boulders and burning oil to decimate the central army and Royal Knights. When she returns to the capital, Pelleas reveals {{that the only way to}} end the blood pact is to kill the signers, and he orders his own death; Micaiah can either do the deed herself, order one of their generals to do it, or refuse outright. Knowing that Daein remains heavily outnumbered, Ike orders the Alliance to assault a major Daein fort in an attempt to finish off the battered nation. The storming of the fort is ended by the arrival of Nailah and Prince Kurthnaga of the dragon laguz nation of Goldoa, who have learned of Daein's plight and sided with them. The next day a massive battle ensues, and the chaos begins to awaken Yune; Micaiah is forced to prematurely awaken her with the galdr of release. Yune's awakening also awakens the goddess of order Ashera.|$|E

The total number of Polish Jews murdered at Sobibór is estimated at a minimum of 170,000. Heinrich Himmler ordered the camp dismantled following a prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943; one of only two successful uprisings by Jewish Sonderkommando inmates in any extermination camp, with 300 escapees (most of them were recaptured by the SS and killed).|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, the War Lord Tower opened {{as one of}} {{the first}} attractions in the theme park. One of the early struggles for Universal was coming up with things for young {{children}} to do. The existing small Ma & Pa Kettle Petting Zoo was expanded into the Ark Park. This area encompassed the Mt. Ararat petting zoo with over 200 animals and birds representing 30 species and a Noah's Nursery and a Noah's Love Inn playhouse for children and animals. This was followed by the opening of the Animal Actors' School Stage in 1970. In 1968 the Screen Actors Guild enacted a rule prohibiting visitors from most soundstages. This new rule coupled with more productions being shot on location meant the backlot tram tour could not show visitors much in the way of real movie and television production. Jay Stein, President of the Recreation Division championed the idea of creating exciting experiences for visitors in place of viewing actual production. Later that same year, the Flash Flood set was opened and this first special-effects attraction proved to be a hit. 20,000 gallons of water rushed 200 feet <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> Mexican village street, uprooting an old tree and threatening to engulf the tram. The Parting of the Red Sea attraction opened in 1973. [...] In 1974, the Rockslide staged event was added to the Studio Tour. The following year The Land of a Thousand Faces opened on the Upper Lot. In 1979, the Battle of Galactica replaced Rockslide as a staged event on the Studio Tour.|$|E
2500|$|This {{starting}} material is finely powdered, {{and placed in}} a container within a Verneuil furnace, with an opening at the bottom through which the powder can escape when the container is vibrated. While the powder is being released, oxygen is supplied into the furnace, and travels with the powder <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> tube. This tube is located within a larger tube, into which hydrogen is supplied. At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen support rod placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the seed crystal eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to crystallise, while its cap always remains liquid. The boule is formed {{in the shape of a}} tapered cylinder, with a diameter broadening away from the base and eventually remaining more or less constant. With a constant supply of powder and withdrawal of the support, very long cylindrical boules can be obtained. Once removed from the furnace and allowed to cool, the boule is split along its vertical axis to relieve internal pressure, otherwise the crystal will be prone to fracture when the stalk is broken due to a vertical parting plane.|$|E
