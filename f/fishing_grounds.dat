5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.|$|E
5|$|Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E
5|$|The {{continental}} shelf off Newfoundland {{is known as}} the Grand Banks. The cold Labrador Current and the warm Gulf Stream meet on the Grand Banks, making the area not only one of the richest <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> in the world, but also one of the foggiest areas. The Grand Banks are an area of significant petroleum production with Hibernia, White Rose and Terra Nova oil fields all located there.|$|E

40|$|Information on {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} of fishing activity can optimize a fisheries management and increase their economical and biological benefit. For effective management and good understanding of fishing activities, information about <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> is crucial. In this study, we aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal of lift net fisheries in Kepulauan Seribu by analyzing their fishing season, investigating their hotspot of <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> using GIS-based hotspot model, and mapping the potential <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> of each target species. We found that anchovy and scad could be caught throughtout the year, while sardine and squid had high fishing season in west monsoon. Hotspot of <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> of lift net fisheries in Kepulauan Seribu waters generally was concentrated around Lancang Island and in southern part of Kotok Island. Potential <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> for sardines was located in around Lancang Island on west monsoon. Squids were highly distributed around Lancang Island in December to January and around Lancang and Rambut Islands in November. Anchovy and scad had more potential <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> in around Kepulauan Seribu waters...|$|R
5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly {{from a series of}} events {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands left the negotiations in protest and {{were excluded from the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|In February 1925, she {{was sold}} again, {{this time to}} a French {{fisherman}} named Victor Fourny. She was renamed Professeur Bergonié, after Jean Bergonié, and registered at Boulogne. After several years in France, the Boston Deep Sea Fishing repurchased her on 4 March 1930, and she was renamed again, this time to the Daily Chronicle (FD69), registered at Fleetwood. She also returned to the same manager as in Boston, Fred Parkes. It was during this time that she had her first unusual duty– on 5 July 1933, she was chartered by the Italian Government to support a transatlantic flight by 24 Savoia-Marchetti S.55X seaplanes. The flight was led by General Italo Balbo, and covered , from Orbetello to Chicago, via Iceland, in 47 hours 52 minutes. She collided with the steam trawler Jacinta (FD235) at St Kilda <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> on 12 August 1934. Although the starboard side of Jacinta was damaged, the Daily Chronicle remained undamaged. On 5 November 1934, her registry at Fleetwood ended, and she was sold to Thomas L Devlin & Sons of Granton, registered there, and renamed Commodator (GN6).|$|E

40|$|A fishing {{productivity}} {{refers to}} production capability of a fishing gear in time, volume, or area of <b>fishing</b> <b>ground.</b> The principle of hand line fishing is fishing {{with a natural}} bait. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the productivity of hand line and to compare the fishing productivity based on fishing time. The research was a case study on one unit hand line during 30 trips in April ??? June 2014. The calculation of fishing productivity (total fish/minute) of hand line was based on the ratio between fish production and actual fishing time. Non-parametric Cruscal-Wallis were used to compare fishing productivity in different times. The regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between fishing productivity and number of natural bait and fishing time. The main production of hand line was Speckled-Fin Rockod (Epinephelus ongus). The area of the <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> was located at 5 ?? 19 ??? 30 ???- 5 ?? 36 ??? 47 ??? S and 119 ?? 48 ??? 30 ???- 120 ?? 20 ??? 0 ??? E. Fishing activities were conducted until three fishing ground/trip with total production of 55 fishes for 30 fishing trips. The productivity for first <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> was 0. 07673 fishes/minute, productivity for second <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> was 0. 09134 fishes/minute, and productivity for third <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> was 0. 06784 fishes/minute. According to Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, the results indicated no significant difference of <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> over <b>fishing</b> time. Regression analysis showed fishing time significantly affect fishing productivity...|$|R
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
25|$|A {{village is}} called a kotan in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, {{particularly}} in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal clan. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|E
