40|$|Abstract—Locomotor {{training}} with a treadmill and <b>harness</b> <b>support</b> is a promising, task-oriented approach to restoring gait function in individuals with poststroke hemiparesis. However, a scientific {{basis for the}} proper selection of training parameters is lacking. Considerable latitude exists {{in the application of}} locomotor training, and training protocols vary widely between experimenters and clinical settings. Recent studies indicate that the prescription of certain parameters, including body-weight support (BWS) and treadmill speed, can affect treatment out-come in hemiparetic individuals. As an initial step toward developing a basis for selection of parameters, we reviewed the literature for studies that quantified the immediate (i. e., within session) biomechanical effects of adjusting BWS, treadmill speed, support stiffness, and handrail hold during treadmill walking in hemiparetic and nondisabled subjects.

40|$|This study {{incorporated}} identity constructs {{into the}} theory of planned behaviour(TPB) to investigate intentions to engage in environmental activism. First year students and participants of a students of sustainability conference(n ¼ 169) were administered a questionnaire survey that measured standard TPB constructs as well as environmental group membership and self-identity as an environmental activist. Consistent with predictions, environmental group membership and self-identity were positive predictors of intentions. Thus, greater involvement in environmental groups and a stronger sense of the self as an environmental activist were associated with stronger intentions to engage inenvironmental activism. There was also evidence that self-identity was a stronger predictor of intentions for participants with low rather than high environmental group membership.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{interactive}} element in social and environmental reporting during a controversy between business organisations and a stakeholder over environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s triangular framework of the rhetorical situation to examine how the writer, the audience, and the purpose of communication interact in the choice of rhetorical strategies used to persuade others of the validity and legitimacy of a claim during a public controversy. The analysis focuses on the strategies (i. e. moves and their rhetorical realisations) in the form of logos (appealing to logic), ethos (appealing to authority), and pathos (appealing to emotion), with a particular emphasis on metaphor, used to achieve social and political goals. The authors base the analysis on a case study involving a conflict between Greenpeace and six organisations in the sportswear/fashion industry over wastewater discharge of hazardous chemicals. The conflict played out in a series of 20 press releases issued by the parties over a two-month period. Findings: All six firms interacting with Greenpeace in the form of press releases eventually conceded to Greenpeace 2 ̆ 7 s demand to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains. The paper attributes this to Greenpeace 2 ̆ 7 s ability to <b>harness</b> <b>support</b> from other key stakeholders and to use rhetoric effectively. Results show the extensive use of rhetoric by all parties. Originality/value: The authors regard legitimacy construction as reliant on communication and as being achieved by organisations participating in a dialogue with stakeholders. For this purpose, the paper develops an analytical framework which situates environmental reporting in a specific rhetorical situation and links rhetoric, argument, and metaphor. ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{new cases}} of spinal-cord-injured (SCI) persons in Canada have {{incomplete}} loss of sensory and/or motor function, but only a minority are able to walk. The study of animal models of spinal cord injury, especially the chronic spinal cat, has shown that monoaminergic drugs can modulate locomotion and spinal reflexes. Clonidine, a noradrenergic agonist, and cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, have each been associated with improved walking in SCI subjects. Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently prescribed for spasticity in SCI patients, but its effects on walking have not been quantified. The objective of this doctoral project was to compare the effects of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen on walking in incomplete SCI subjects. Subjects were evaluated on a motorized treadmill. Severely disabled subjects required <b>harness</b> <b>support</b> for their evaluations. The treadmill and harness system are described in detail, and their potential uses in the evaluation and rehabilitation of gait are discussed. A repeated single-subject design was employed for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects {{were found in the}} the subjects with greater severity of disability. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus, among other improvements in walking patterns. Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS, and a generally more upright posture, among other improvements in walking patterns. Baclofen was not associated with changes in walking, although two subjects showed small improvements following washout of baclofen. Among subjects with less severe motor disability, drug effects were less marked. Following washout of cyproheptadine or clonidine, subjects frequently retained walking improvements such as increases in MTS and reduced need for assistance that had first been evident in the drug periods. The significance and implications of the drug effects and the retention of effects du...|$|E
40|$|Young people ages 15 to 24 are 1. 2 {{billion of}} the world’s human capital. Around the world, {{many of them are}} already making {{contributions}} to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and their work should be further acknowledged and strengthened. Increasingly, youth are recognized as key participants in decision-making and development, as reflected in the growing presence of non-governmental youth organizations and the upsurge of youth advisory boards and committees to international institutions and programmes. Yet building the capacity of and creating sustained partnerships with young people are crucial strategies to achieving the MDGs that have not been fully realized by the international community. This paper aims to provide an overview of youth participation as it currently exists, to outline the ways in which youth are directly involved and affected by each Goal, to demonstrate the ways in which young people are contributing to the MDGs, and to provide ‘Options for Action’ that governments, the United Nations system, donors and other actors can <b>harness,</b> <b>support,</b> and scale-up in order to support young people in making significant contributions to achieving the MDGs. Part I outlines the existing mechanisms for youth participation in development policy. These channels can be used by governments and institutions to strengthen and mobilize young people as partners in policy formulation. Successful modes of participation should be recognized and replicated, and also adapted to the challenging political and socio-economic realities facing many youth-led and youth-serving organizations. Part II presents youth participation as it relates directly to the MDGs. Each goal is analyzed with respect to its effect on young peoples lives as well as how young people can play – and indeed are playing — a role in its implementation. Under each goal are a number of “Options for Action” that governments, the UN and multilateral organizations can use to fully harness the contributions that youth can make to achieving the MDGs. Part III outlines the synergies between the Options for Action presented in this report and the Quick Wins proposed by the Millennium Project. The Options for Action are complimentary and provide a process to implement the Quick Win actions, using young people as key implementing agents and service providers. Part III also outlines a number of youth-focused Quick Wins that can make a significant and measurable difference to the state of young people in target countries. Part IV elaborates on how youth can participate in achieving the MDGs and contains cross-cutting recommendations on youth engagement in all 8 Goals. Overall, the report demonstrates that investing in youth will provide the longest and most effective dividend towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by building the social capital needed to foster pragmatic development. Indeed, without the involvement of young people, a demographic that comprises one fifth of the world’s total population, the full achievement of the MDGs will remain elusive and their long-term sustainability will be compromised. Youth participation is currently quite varied, ranging from effective, to sometimes tokenistic, to often non-existent. There are specific ways in which youth and youth organizations can contribute to the design and implementation of MDG-based strategies, some of which are outlined in this document. Many projects are already happening, but there is much work left still to be done. ...|$|E
