5|$|The Grosvenor Sanatorium {{opened in}} 1915 to help {{patients}} suffering from tuberculosis, and could cater for 110 male patients, and 78 female. The philosopher Simone Weil lived in Ashford after escaping from France during World War II. She <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> about leaving French people behind in suffering {{and did not}} eat well. She subsequently contracted tuberculosis and {{was moved to the}} sanatorium where she died in 1943. A section of the old Ashford Bypass is now named Simone Weil Avenue, while the sanatorium subsequently became the Ashford Police Training Centre.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, so he would cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|Alma is {{nonetheless}} freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher {{and leader of}} Project Origin, Harlan Wade (Grant Goodeve), who <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> over the company's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father. The player is then called to sabotage the structure's reactor, running a gauntlet against Alma's ghosts before the whole location explodes. In {{the aftermath of the}} detonation, a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble, rescuing him. While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter, Jin wonders what happened to Alma. Just then, the helicopter loses power, and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin: the destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest to get closer to her son.|$|E
5|$|Months before Entre a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police. In December 1992, Pérez was convicted and was ordered to pay $670 (1992 USD) in fines, court costs, and attorney fees. Pérez wrote that he <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> for the crimes that he was charged with, noting that Selena tried to convince Abraham that Pérez was a well-rounded person. Pérez later told Abraham about his wrongdoing, but was dumbfounded when Abraham forgave him, a reaction that Pérez was not expecting. After the band completed the recording sessions for Entre a Mi Mundo, several members of the band and their friends went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel. The next morning, Abraham was contacted by the manager of the hotel where the incident took place; Abraham immediately fired two road crew members. Pérez believed that Abraham would come for him next and fire him, but found that after he had apologized, Abraham accepted his apology and allowed him to continue being the band's guitarist.|$|E

25|$|Chris couldn't eat for {{two days}} after his wife's murder. In his book he {{says that when he}} could not sleep he began abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion.

25|$|In the 1930s, Armand Denis made {{films that}} {{told the world}} about Africa. However, his {{documentary}} gave fanciful stories about Rwanda's Tutsis being a noble ruling elite originally from Egypt, whereas the Hutus were a peasant race. In reality, they were racially the same, and the Belgian rulers had ruthlessly exploited the myth. But {{when it came to}} independence, liberal Belgians <b>felt</b> <b>guilty,</b> and decided the Hutus should overthrow the Tutsi rule. This led to a bloodbath, as the Tutsis were then seen as aliens and were slaughtered.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, {{his father}} died of heart and kidney failure {{at the age of}} 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had {{announced}} to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.|$|E

25|$|Charlie's {{family was}} not {{dysfunctional}} or abusive. On the contrary, Charlie's parents adored him, and made great sacrifices {{to give him}} a good education. His Da, a gardener for a rich Anglo-Irish family, was kind and patient, but also woefully unsophisticated and lacking in ambition. Charlie loved Da, but was also embarrassed by him, and <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> for this embarrassment. Charlie was an illegitimate child at a time when this carried a heavy stigma in Catholic Ireland. Though Da accepted Charlie fully, Charlie always felt like an outsider, heavily indebted to Da. Moreover, Charlie could never find a way to repay Da, or even fully express his love and gratitude.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, at age 12, {{her family}} became {{involved}} with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> for her sins, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer, and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.|$|E
25|$|Next, the {{governor}} sent {{his son to}} Constantinople (Istanbul) {{to meet with the}} Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I. The purpose for the visit was to ask the sultan for a reward for saving Mosul. The sultan issued an official Firman in 1778 and paid Hussein Pasha al-Jalili 800 Qirsh to buy the village of Baghdida. The people of Baghdida were very upset about what had happened. They met and decided after long deliberation to abandon the village. When al-Jalili heard the story, he <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> and decided to return the village to its rightful owners. He issued a decree in 1778, in which he relinquished his ownership to Baghdida, but he kept his rights to receive the tenth of its produce in taxes.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought this}} fine, too, but still, {{it seemed to}} him, in the narrow little world where a child dwells, that {{his father and his}} {{grandfather}} were about the only people there were who did not wish the Mexicans whipped, and he <b>felt</b> secretly <b>guilty</b> for them before the other boys.|$|R

25|$|While in the desert, Florinda confesses {{the events}} of her rape to Roderick and reveals that she truly loved Roderick whereas his wife, Egilona, was now married to Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, a Moorish leader. She also admits that she <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> for the seduction. Roderick accepts that his sin was from tragic {{circumstances}} and not from his own fault. After the confession, they travel {{to the land of}} Count Pedro, father of Alphonso. While there, they discover an army of men wanting to be led off to war. When Pedro sees that the hostages, Pelayo and Alphonso, are free, he decides to go to battle. To settle any past family problems, Pelayo's daughter and Pedro's son marry, and Alphonso is made the heir of the Kingdom of León and promises to keep fighting until the Moors are defeated. However, Moors come and attack at the same time but are stopped by the warriors. A captured Moor tells Pelayo that another invasion force was sent to Pelayo's old castle and the army sets out.|$|E
25|$|Hughes Communications {{immediately}} {{noticed the}} jamming, {{and threatened to}} shut down HBO's satellite signal or alter the satellite's course, with executives believing the hacker was a domestic terrorist. HBO's technician, working at the company's communication center in Hauppauge, Long Island, telephoned Hughes Communications, but officials there could not offer an explanation to the jamming, and so he attempted to regain control by increasing the uplink transmission power from 125 watts to 2,000 watts. This was unsuccessful, as MacDougall increased his power in a control battle that lasted about 90 seconds, during which it was feared that a further power increase would damage the satellite. MacDougall got scared, abandoned his control of the satellite, and went home. The following day, he <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> about his actions, but hoped the jamming would not be noticed by anyone not working for HBO. MacDougall was later surprised to see his actions being reported on network television. Thus, {{when he returned to}} work that night he pretended to have no knowledge about the intrusion, and asked questions about what had happened. MacDougall only told close friends, and had visions about federal agents visiting his home.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{was born}} Constance Frances Marie Ockelman in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Her father, Harry Eugene Ockelman, was of German and Irish descent, {{and worked for}} an oil company aboard a ship. He died in an {{industrial}} explosion in Philadelphia in 1932. Lake's mother, Constance Frances Charlotta (née Trimble; 1902–1992), of Irish descent, married Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist, also of Irish descent, in 1933, and Lake began using his surname. The Keanes lived in Saranac Lake, New York, where young Lake attended St. Bernard's School for a time, then was sent to Villa Maria, an all-girls Catholic boarding school in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from which she was expelled. Lake later claimed she attended McGill University and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. With this being included in many press biographies (although she later declared her claim was a fabrication), Lake <b>felt</b> <b>guilty</b> and subsequently apologized {{to the president of}} McGill who was simply amused when she explained her habit of self-dramatizing. But when her stepfather fell ill during her second year, the Keane family later moved to Miami, Florida. Lake attended Miami High School, where she was known for her beauty. She had a troubled childhood and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to her mother.|$|E
