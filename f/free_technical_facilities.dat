There is {{a new level of}} {{the problem of}} reality of statistical guarantees of uninterrupted radio control. In this paper, the research of opportunities to optimize the radio control of <b>technical</b> <b>facilities</b> of protection of counteraction at the time when radio system which controls the <b>technical</b> <b>facilities</b> can determine the other system’s means of countering and the system that creates noise and works on the same frequency cannot.

40|$|Part 1 : Environmental Application in the Scope of the Future InternetInternational audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} PROMETHEE-GAIA methodology in a multiple criteria analysis to rank potential environmental investments in mineral-processing companies. The intent of the paper is to identify best <b>technical</b> <b>facilities</b> {{on the basis of}} preferential relations between a set of variants. The method of Total Cost Analysis (TCA) was chosen to define the criteria. The economic and environmental costs, as well as the benefits of these <b>technical</b> <b>facilities,</b> were determined by means of this method. PROMETHEE is one of the methods in the Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) category. The MCA, as the name implies, deals with the evaluation of a number of variants by several criteria. The <b>technical</b> <b>facility</b> was selected by a comparative analysis involving five influential parameters (Investment Costs, Annual Operating Costs, Operating Income, Administrative Costs and Disposal Fees, Economic and Environmental Benefits). As expected, the analysis resulted in a preferential ranking of these <b>technical</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R
