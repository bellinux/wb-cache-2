30|$|The best {{isobutanol}} producer strains constructed so far must {{be equipped}} with different mutations {{in order to achieve}} a high isobutanol yield, because the recombinants based on the transformation of wild type strains accumulate other intermediates and produce very low isobutanol yields (Atsumi et al. 2008; Atsumi and Liao 2008; Connor and Liao 2009; Gronenberg et al. 2013). One of the best producer strains is E. coli JCL 206, a multiple mutant strain (ΔadhE, ΔfrdBC, Δfnr, ΔldhA, Δpta, ΔpflB) derived from E. coli K 12 strain BW 25113, bearing two plasmids, pSA 65 and pSA 69, that produces about 7  g l− 1 of isobutanol in flasks (Atsumi et al. 2008, 2010) when cultured in similar conditions to that used in this work. This suggests that the recombinant E. coli W (ATCC 9637) and S. blattae strains are good candidates to be improved as isobutanol producers. In this sense it is important to mention that E. coli JCL 206 (pSA 65, pSA 69) can produce up to 22  g l− 1 when cultured in higher concentrations of glucose and longer times (Atsumi et al. 2008) or even higher (about 50  g l− 1) in bioreactors with in situ product removal (Baez et al. 2011). In this sense, {{it is very difficult to}} compare the isobutanol productions described in the literature because when the recombinant bacteria are cultured in flasks, the alcohol is partially evaporated during the fermentation process. Then, to reduce the isobutanol <b>evaporation,</b> <b>flasks</b> must be sealed causing microaerophilic fermentation conditions that do not favour the bacterial growth and are difficult to control and reproduce.|$|R

40|$|Zidovudine (AZT) is {{commonly}} used to treat patients with AIDS, but it is limited by toxicity and high dosing needs. Alternative formulations have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate process-related variables like hydration and sonication time, rotation speed of <b>evaporation</b> <b>flask,</b> and the effects of charge-inducing agent and centrifugation on zidovudine entrapment and release from niosomes. Formulation of zidovudine niosomes was optimized by altering the proportions of Tween, Span and cholesterol. The effect of process–related variables like hydration time, sonication time, charge-inducing agent, centrifugation and rotational speed of <b>evaporation</b> <b>flask</b> on zidovudine entrapment and release from niosomes was evaluated. The effect of changes in osmotic shock and viscosity were also evaluated. Non-sonicated niosomes were in the size range of 2 - 3. 5  μm and sonicated niosomes formulated with Tween 80 and dicetylphosphate (DCP) had a mean diameter of 801  nm. Zidovudine niosomes formulated with Tween 80 entrapped high amounts of drug and the addition of DCP enhanced drug release for a longer time (88. 72 % over 12  h). The mechanism of release from Tween 80 formulation was the Fickian type and obeyed first-order release kinetics. Niosomes can be formulated by proper adjustment of process parameters to enhance zidovudine entrapment and sustainability of release. These improvements in zidovudine formulation may be useful in developing a more effective AIDS therapy...|$|E

Adenine inhibition was prevented more readily than adenosine inhibition. More than 90 % of the biological activity of the supernatant fluid was recovered in the anionic fraction after treatment with Dowex- 50 (NH 4 +). The cationic fraction, containing large amounts of 5 -aminoimidazole ribonucleoside (AIRS), did not prevent adenine inhibition. The W- 11 supernatant fluid was shown by bioautography to contain only one compound that prevented adenine inhibition. Proliferating and non-proliferating cultures produced only one compound that prevented adenine inhibition.

40|$|The {{objective}} of present experimental work was to optimize processing parameters of ocular liposomes using {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) as an optimization tool. The human eye is easily accessible site for topical dosing of drugs intended for local action or {{in the interior of}} the eye. Ganciclovir (GCV) is a synthetic analogue of 2 '-deoxy-guanosine used in treatment and prevention of cytomegalovirus infections and in treatment of ocular herpes infection (orphan disease). The poor bioavailability (5 - 9 %) of this drug has lead development of ocular liposome to improve the bioavailability and enhance therapeutic effectiveness. GCV loaded liposomes were prepared by classical rotary <b>flask</b> <b>evaporation</b> method using HSPC/DSPG as lipid part and cholesterol as vesicle stabilizer. Box-Behnken design was applied on the selected processing parameters i. e. flask speed (X 1), hydration volume (X 2) and hydration temperature (X 3) whereas the formulation variables were kept constant. The feed forward back propagation neural network (BPNN) method was optimized using experimental data and validated for accurate prediction of dependent variables. The obtained root mean square value of the trained ANN model was 0. 00004, which indicated that the optimal model was reached. The predicted data from ANN and the experimental data were compared by chi square test which showed no significant difference. The results conclude that the ANN model provides accurate prediction and should be further explored in optimization of novel pharmaceutical formulations...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{aromatic}} choline esters {{occurring in}} seeds of Brassicaceae are determined, after extraction {{with a mixture}} of methanol and acetic acid 0. 01 N (70 / 30), by high performance liquid chromatography. So, from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view, it is very useful to have in the laboratory pure standards for confirm retention times, response factors and for the constitution of u. v., infra-red or mass spectra libraries. As choline esters are not available by a commercial way, we decided to synthesise different aromatic choline esters (36). The structure of the acidic part of all the choline esters prepared are derived from benzoic or cinnamic acids with hydroxy or methoxy substituants in ortho, para or meta position. Pure aromatic choline esters were synthesised according to a fast method using bromocholine bromide. An aromatic acid (in excess) in methanol is first neutralised by NaOH (0. 1 N). Then bromocholine bromide in methanol is added in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>flask.</b> Solvent is evaporated to dryness using a rotative evaporator Büchi (40 °C). The flask containing the dried mixture is placed in an oven (107 °C) during 5 hours, avoiding carbonisation. The choline ester is taken up with 2 x 3 ml of distilled water and purified on a SP Sephadex C 25 - 120 resin. After washing with distilled water, the ester is eluted HCl (1 N). The elution is followed by measuring u. v. absorbance at 280 nm. The eluate is evaporated to dryness with a rotative evaporator (Büchi) and the crystals obtained are washed with acetone. The purity obtained for all the choline esters produced was close to 98 % and total amount between 5 to 100 mg.

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study on the {{bioremediation}} of oil spills in tropical mangrove habitats, we conducted a series of flask experiments to test for the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in representative wetland habitats. Also tested was the biodegradation of selected oils (Gippsland Crude, Arabian Light Crude and Bunker C), that are transported along the Australian coast. We also tested for potential inhibition of biodegradation by natural organics in the mangrove pore waters and evaluated the ability of an oxygen release compound (ORC) to stimulate biodegradative processes. Evaporation was a significant factor in removing the light alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons from air and nitrogen sparged <b>flasks.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> removed sim 27 % of the Gippsland, sim 37 %of the Arabian, and sim 10 % of the Bunker oils. Oxygen was necessary to support biodegradation as expected. The microdashorganisms were capable of biodegrading the nondashvolatile saturate fraction of each oil. Degradation removed another 14 of the Gippsland, 30 of the Arabian, and 22 of the Bunker C oils. Normalisation of the individual aromatic hydrocarbon classes to internal triterpane biomarkers indicated some degradation of aromatics in the Arabian Light and Bunker C oils. Although alkane degradation rates were comparable in the three oils, the Gippsland oil had a higher wax content and after 14 days incubation, still contained as much as 25 of the alkanes present in the original oil. Thus, degradation of its aromatic fraction may have been delayed. Based on these results we estimate that Arabian Light Crude oil would have a shorter residence time than the other oils in mangrove sediment. It has a higher content of light hydrocarbons, which are readily removed by both physical and microbial processes. The Bunker C would be expected to have the longest residence time in mangrove sediment, because it contains a larger percentage of higher molecular weight, unresolved components. Comparison of the efficiency of inoculates from three tropical intertidal habitats (Avicennia and Rhizophora mangroves, plus salt marsh sediments) indicated the presence of hydrocarbon degrading microdashorganisms in all three habitats. There was no known history of oil contamination in the soil source area. There was no inhibition of degradation due to addition of mangrove pore waters. The ORC did not facilitate degradation in closed laboratory experiments.

40|$|Authors: Houssein Ibrahim, Clémentine Gibard, Audrey Hospital, Christelle Gaulier, Natasha Hewitt, Arnaud Gautier & Federico Cisnetti ### Abstract The syntesis of 2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -iodoaniline and 2, 6 -diisopropyl- 4 -iodoanilne is described. Both {{compounds}} {{were easily}} obtained in using an aromatic iodination reaction with molecular iodine. The desired products were isolated in nearly quantitative yields after a simple extraction. The crude materials are pure according to NMR. ### Introduction 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dialkylanilines are useful {{building blocks for}} chemical synthesis as highlighted in several recent publications describing diversified applications: medicinal chemistry (1, 2, 3), materials (4) and ligand design for catalysis (5). These synthons are usually obtained by aromatic iodination of commercial 4, 6 -diiodoanilines. Most protocols imply the use of iodine monochloride, a hazardous fuming liquid (1, 4, 5), sophisticated reagents (benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (3, 6), [K(18 -crown- 6) ](ICl 2) (7) or molecular iodine {{in combination with other}} reagents (Ag 2 SO 4 (8) or iodic acid 2). However, almost 50 years ago, the first publication describing the aromatic iodination of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (9) implied a much simpler procedure using molecular iodine, which is also less hazardous than ICl. However, the isolation of the desired was reported only in moderate yield after a lengthy steam–distillation. While repeating this experiment we discovered that the crude material quantitatively recovered prior to distillation was analytically pure and could be used for further reactions. This simple protocol was simply scaled up to about 100 g of 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline and 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents 1. 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (liquid) - 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline (liquid) - molecular diiodine (solid) - diethyl ether - saturated aqueous sodium carbonate - saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate - CDCl 3 for NMR sample preparation ### Equipment 1. balance - fume hood - 2 L two-necked round-bottomed flask - funnel - 2 L separation funnel - 1 L or 2 L round-bottomed <b>evaporation</b> <b>flask</b> - 100 mL dropping funnel - mechanical stirrer - rotary evaporator - high vacuum pump - large crystallising dish - NMR spectrometer and tubes for NMR characterisation ### Procedure **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline** 1. Equip a 2 L two-necked flask with a mechanic agitator - Weigh out 119 g (0. 466 mol) of iodine in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Dissolve it in 400 mL of diethyl ether. Pour the resulting solution into a 2 L two-necked flask using a funnel. Wash the funnel with a minimal amount of diethyl ether. - CAUTION: if the balance is not inside a fume hood, iodine must be weighed in a stoppered flask. In this case, the zero of the balance must be set with the round bottomed flask and the stopper. The flask is then removed from the balance and iodine added inside a fume hood. The flask is stopper and weighed. This process is repeated until the desired mass is reached. - Add 1 L of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. - Charge a dropping funnel with 80. 0 mL (75. 2 g, 424 mmol) of 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. Add the aniline dropwise in the stirred reaction mixture (approximate duration: 5 min). Gas evolution is observed. - CAUTION: In the case the gaseous evolution becomes too vigorous, addition and stirring can be temporarily halted. - Stir vigorously the resulting biphasic mixture for 2 h. Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 60, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 55) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the combined organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator. - Dry the resulting dark liquid in high vacuum overnight. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline** 1. Equip a 2 L two-necked flask equipped with a mechanic agitator - Weigh out 119 g (0. 466 mol) of iodine in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Dissolve it in 400 mL of diethyl ether. Pour the resulting solution into a 2 L two-necked flask using a funnel. Wash the funnel with a minimal amount of diethyl ether. - CAUTION: If the balance is not inside a fume hood, iodine must be weighed in a stoppered flask. In this case, the zero of the balance must be set with the round bottomed flask and the stopper. The flask is then removed from the balance and iodine added inside a fume hood. The flask is stopper and weighed. This process is repeated until the desired mass is reached. - Add 1 L of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. - Charge a dropping funnel with 52. 4 mL (51. 4 g, 424 mmol) of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline. Add the aniline dropwise in the stirred reaction mixture (approximate duration: 5 min). Gas evolution is observed. - CAUTION: In the case the gaseous evolution becomes too vigorous, addition and stirring can be temporarily halted. - Stir vigorously the resulting biphasic mixture for 2 h. Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 50, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisomethylaniline) = 0. 45) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate with stirring until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Transfer the reaction mixture to the 2 L separation funnel. Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator using a 2 L. - Pour the resulting oil in a crystallizing dish along with a minimal amount of diethyl ether to wash the flask. During the drying process 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline crystallises. - CAUTION: Crystallisation, which is exothermic, may occur abruptly resulting in the dish to become hot. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. ### Timing - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield for 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline 97 % (124. 7 g). Yields obtained in smaller-scale preparations: 96 % (61. 7 g), 94 %* (24. 1 g), 94 %* (10. 4 g). *performed with magnetic instead of mechanic stirring. ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") Typical isolated yield for 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline 81 % (84. 7 g).
