30|$|We {{analysed}} {{the parking}} <b>durations</b> of the freight vehicles. Vehicles parked in different locations show different distribution of parking <b>durations,</b> with vehicles parked on-street having the shorter parking <b>durations</b> and vehicles that {{park in the}} carpark showing longer <b>durations.</b> We then considered only the parking <b>durations</b> of vehicles inside the LB, showing a remarkable fit with the lognormal distribution and a sample mean of about 30  min. Analysing the time series of parking <b>durations</b> of individual vehicles that parked in the LB between January and July 2016, we {{see that there is}} no clear trend in the mean. It seems that parking <b>durations</b> are not affected by seasonal variation, nor the drivers seem to improve its performance overtime. Finally, longer parking <b>durations</b> are associated with a larger volume of goods handled per worker, for vehicles with higher loadings and whenever a pick-up is performed; while lower <b>durations</b> are associated with the vehicle type being a van, with a higher number of workers helping the driver in performing the delivery/pick-up and with longer experienced queueing times.|$|R

50|$|During natural scene viewing, the masking of {{an image}} by {{replacing}} it with a grey field during fixations has an increase in fixation <b>durations</b> (Henderson & Pierce, 2008). More subtle degradations {{of an image}} on fixation <b>durations,</b> such as the decrease in luminance of an image during fixations, also increases the length of fixation <b>durations</b> (Henderson, Nuthmann & Luke, 2013). An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation <b>durations</b> (Walshe & Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as blurring or phase noise, increases fixation <b>durations</b> when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation <b>durations</b> when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke & Schmidt, 2014; Einhäuser et al., 2006).|$|R

40|$|Studies of BATSE bursts kouveliotou: 93 have {{resulted}} in the widespread adoption of a two-group categorization: long bursts (those with <b>durations</b> ≥ 2 seconds) and short bursts (those with <b>durations</b> ≤ 2 seconds). This categorization, one must recall, used the observed T_ 90 time <b>durations</b> for bursts (during which 90 % of a burst's fluence is measured). In this work, we have explored two ideas: 1) a statistical search for a possible third, intermediate category of bursts (between the "short" and the "long" ones) among 2041 BATSE GRBs and 757 Swift/BAT ones, 2) a study of bursts' intrinsic <b>durations,</b> where <b>durations</b> in the bursts' reference frames (instead of the observed <b>durations)</b> are considered, for this, 248 Swift/BAT bursts that have redshift measurements were statistically analyzed for the same categorization goal. We first use a Monte Carlo method to determine the proper binning of each GRB, considering that bursts come with different uncertainties on their <b>durations.</b> Then, using the method of minimization of chi-square χ^ 2, we search for the best fit of the normalized frequency distributions 1 /N_ 0 dN/dT of <b>durations,</b> this allows us to compare fits with two groups ("short" and "long") with fits with three groups ("short", "long", and "intermediate"). Our results indicate that the distributions of observed <b>durations</b> are better fitted by three groups than two groups for Swift/BAT data, interestingly, the "intermediate" group appears rather clearly for both observed and intrinsic <b>durations.</b> For BATSE data, the statistical test does not prefer three groups over two. We discuss the results, their possible underlying causes, and reasonable interpretations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn two {{experiments}} {{we investigated}} {{the control of}} fixation <b>durations</b> in naturalistic scene viewing. Empirical evidence from the scene onset delay paradigm and numerical simulations of such data with the CRISP model [Psychological Review 117 (2010) 382 – 405] have suggested that processing related difficulties may lead to prolonged fixation <b>durations.</b> Here, we ask whether processing related facilitation may lead to comparable decreases to fixation <b>durations.</b> Research in visual search and reading have reported only uni-directional shifts. To {{address the question of}} unidirectional (slow down) as opposed to bidirectional (slow down and speed up) adjustment of fixation <b>durations</b> in the context of scene viewing, we used a saccade-contingent display change method to either reduce or increase the luminance of the scene during prespecified critical fixations. Degrading the stimulus by shifting luminance down resulted in an immediate increase to fixation <b>durations.</b> However, clarifying the stimulus by shifting luminance upwards did not result in a comparable decrease to fixation <b>durations.</b> These results suggest that the control of fixation <b>durations</b> in scene viewing is asymmetric, as has been reported for visual search and reading...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPre-saccadic {{fixation}} <b>durations</b> {{associated with}} saccades directed {{in different directions}} were compared in three endogenous-attention oriented saccadic scanning tasks (i. e. visual search and scene viewing). Pre-saccadic fixation <b>durations</b> were consistently briefer before the execution of upward saccades, than downward saccades. Saccades also had a higher probability of being directed upwards than downwards. Pre-saccadic fixation <b>durations</b> were symmetric and longer for horizontally-directed saccades. The vertical visual field asymmetry in pre-saccadic fixation <b>durations</b> reflects an influence of factors {{not directly related to}} currently fixated elements. The ability to predict pre-saccadic fixation <b>durations</b> is important for computational modelling of real-time saccadic scanning, and the findings make a case for including directional constraints in computational modelling of when the eyes move...|$|R
