40|$|When {{consumers}} {{choose between}} clean and dirty goods and the labour market clears, a green tax reform may not {{bring about a}} double dividend {{in the sense of}} increasing environmental quality and increasing employment. However, when firms choose between clean and dirty factors of production, and when there is unemployment, such a result is very likely to occur. The paper investigates a model of a monopolistic firm where labour and energy are factors of production and trade unions negotiate the wage rate, accepting some unemployment as a result of aggressive wage demands. It is shown that, in such a framework, a green tax reform will boost employment provided it does not increase the net-of-tax wage rate by too much.

40|$|How should <b>green</b> <b>taxation</b> be {{designed}} so that it accommodates producer interests? We argue that to design green taxes which are high enough to have the desired incentive effects, tax revenues must be reimbursed, either by earmarking them for environmental subsidies or by reducing other taxes directed at industry. If green tax schemes can {{be designed}} this way, industry will {{have little incentive to}} mobilise strong opposition to <b>green</b> <b>taxation.</b> However, in practice, the requirement of reimbursement may be difficult to fulfil because, with few exceptions, polluting industries are not homogeneous. This means that reimbursement will redistribute financial resources within industry and thus create winners and losers. Still, green taxes can be used in heterogeneous industries which can be created by operating separate tax schemes for each branch of industry. The Danish case of pesticide taxation demonstrates that relatively high tax levels can be implemented if an equal relationship between the tax object and the object determining the level of refunds exists throughout the sector. This means that revenues can be reimbursed without creating redistribution within producer communities. Green taxation; Policy design; Reimbursement; Lobbyism; Redistribution...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} anti-warming {{measures}} in the passenger vehicle sector and estimates the impacts of three policies in the <b>green</b> car <b>taxation</b> plan on consumer behavior with respect to car purchases. The three policies refer specifically to, first, preferential <b>taxation</b> for <b>green</b> vehicles; second, special treatment of the vehicle acquisition tax when acquiring fuel-efficient vehicles; and third, special treatment of the vehicle acquisition tax when acquiring low-pollution vehicles. Our estimates are based on fiscal 2004 data, following the introduction of these policies. According to our findings, {{as far as the}} effect of the change in pricing structure alone is concerned, the policies contributed slightly to the objective of promoting motor vehicles with less harmful impact on the environment. However, the tax cuts lower the purchase cost and thus create incentives for consumers who otherwise might not purchase these vehicles without such tax cuts. Accordingly, such policies could be contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. Even so, our study has also revealed that the impacts themselves are limited, given that the ratio of tax abatements to total vehicle cost is limited. As a hypothetical policy, our study simulates a package in which the tax cut rate for hybrid vehicles is expanded considerably and the reduction in vehicle acquisition tax on gasoline-powered vehicles is abolished, to reduce the price disparity between the two types of vehicles. This suggests that to ensure that tax cuts have an effect, it is necessary to, first, make a very substantial tax cut for hybrid vehicles and to, second, terminate tax cuts for gasoline powered vehicles, for the purposes of ensuring that the cuts do not motivate consumers who would otherwise not buy a car to purchase a vehicle and narrowing the price gap between gasoline powered and hybrid vehicles. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{pressures}} on the environment are increasing around the world. In particular, Hong Kong, a compact city {{with a population of}} nearly seven million, one which has undergone remarkable economic growth over the past few decades, has developed severe environmental problems. It also has deficiencies in its taxation system: a small tax base, for example. In today’s world, “green” taxes have been accepted and applied by more and more countries, especially those in the OECD. However, Hong Kong still has not adequately used the tax tool {{as an integral part of}} the government’s anti-pollution strategy. Accordingly, the major objective of this study is to make proposals for improving the use of green tax measures in Hong Kong. The study first systematically introduces background theories of green tax and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. Then, it elaborates on the primary environmental problems in Hong Kong, followed by describing the green tax measures currently existing in the city. The thesis then summarizes and analyzes green tax measures in selected countries which are at the cutting edge of utilizing the tax tool as an integral part in their environmental policy, especially the Scandinavian nations. The study also conducts interviews with Government officials, green groups and those potentially in opposition to green tax. Finally, by drawing on the experiences of green tax measures in selected countries, proposals are made on improving existing green tax measures, introducing new environmental taxes, using the revenue from these taxes and dealing with implementation issues. The research findings of this project will help modernize as well as to <b>green</b> Hong Kong’s <b>taxation</b> system and thus eventually to improve the environment of Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{consumption}} (SC) {{and sustainable}} lifestyles have become prominent areas of environmental discourse and decision-making in recent years, {{and have been}} adopted as policy objectives by international agencies, national governments, local authorities, NGOs and citizen's action groups. The tools proposed for SC include eco-labelling, environmental <b>taxation,</b> <b>green</b> consumerism, regulation, downshifting, localisation etc., and these tools reflect the very different values and beliefs which are held by different actors in society, about what SC might be and how to achieve it. This paper examines the principal discourses of SC using a cultural theory analytical framework. It illustrates a range of perspectives of SC as being representative of underlying worldviews and beliefs about the environment and society. Using food as a case study, the issues and values surrounding SC are highlighted, referring to fair trade, local production and distribution (farmers markets, organic box schemes), GM foods and organics (local and imported). The analytical framework is used to explore {{the ways in which}} citizens' and community groups' efforts to enact SC at the local level and in everyday life, are shaped, helped or hindered by the embodied values of social institutions and higher levels of decision-making. The cultural theory framework itself is critically analysed, and found to be a useful heuristic tool for categorising different SC views and initiatives, but lacking in explanatory power when attention turns to structural power relations and the hegemony of individualistic market culture. The policy implications of this analysis are discussed: governments should intervene to create space for marginalised cultures and act to widen the real choices available to consumers and citizens...|$|R

We show that this externality raises the consumption of the green product, reduces the environmental quality of products and improves welfare, even if it doesn't affect the overall level of pollution.

According to the analysis, no increase in proceeds from environmental taxes over the last decade can be found either in Belgium or the EU taken as a whole. The declining trend in the importance of environmental taxes is mainly a result of the decreasing energy intensity of the economy.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of industrialisation, economists {{believed}} that the ramifications of economic growth will far outweigh the potential damage to the environment. Today the concern is the rising magnitude of emissions. Many economies are under immense pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon taxation and absorption technologies seem to be the main mechanisms controlling emissions in different nations. China proposed her target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40 - 45 % by 2025.
