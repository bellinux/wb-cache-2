40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{direct and}} indirect contributions of foreign <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) to aggregate productivity growth. We focus our attention on foreign <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> small <b>firms</b> for three reasons. First, industrial policy in almost all countries is oriented towards supporting SMEs and attracting foreign investment. Second, these two categories of firms contribute to micro-heterogeneity in all industries. Third, the recent industrial dynamics literature on foreign investment <b>and</b> small <b>firms</b> emphasizes the potential benefits of foreign <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> SMEs in generating new technologies, and creating new jobs. Using the data for Turkish manufacturing plants, we estimate production functions for all ISIC 4 -digit level industries for the 1983 - 2001 period. We decompose productivity growth into its components (structural change, entry and exit, technical change, efficiency change, and scale effects) by <b>firm</b> ownership <b>and</b> size. The decomposition analysis by <b>firm</b> ownership <b>and</b> size allows us to understand the sources of productivity contributions by foreign <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> small <b>firms.</b> Productivity dynamics, decomposition, foreign direct investment, small and medium sized enterprises...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between ownership structure and board of director composition and their influences on the total factor productivity (TFP) of Taiwan's firms. The empirical {{results show that the}} curvilinear specification is better to capture {{the relationship between}} inside ownership <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> productivity. Meanwhile, the ownership structure in a firm indeed affects differences in TFP between conglomerate <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> non-conglomerate <b>firms,</b> high-tech <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> non-high-tech <b>firms,</b> <b>and</b> family-owned <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> non-family-owned <b>firms.</b> Additionally, a smaller board may be less encumbered by bureaucratic problems and more functional and CEO duality may be able to improve productivity. Furthermore, productivity deteriorates with increasing proportion of collateralised shares. More institutional holdings, however, are an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of collateralised shares on TFP.

We find no significant difference in abnormal returns between R&D <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> nonR&D <b>firms,</b> providing evidence against signalling effects of stock splits. We find that the average monthly trading volume following stock splits is significantly higher compared to the pre-split level for both industrial <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> depository institutions.
