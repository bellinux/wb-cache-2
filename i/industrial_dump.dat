RAVEN claims that assisting the Tsilhqot’in Nation is a chance to prevent ecological disaster before it takes place.

50|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{remaining}} German-speaking portion of Celje was expelled. The new communist government took advantage of existing anti-tank trenches, dug around Celje by the retreating German army, by using them as mass graves. They were filled with Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian militia members that had collaborated with the Germans, as well as civilians that had opposed either the national liberation movement or the communist revolution during the war, civilians of German descent, or simply individuals accused or suspected of anti-communism. The purpose was to physically eliminate any potential political opposition, on the pretext of collaboration with the enemy. The Yugoslav National Army executed more than 80,000—mostly Croat, German, and Slovene—prisoners in the Celje area, without any judicial process. The bodies were buried in hidden mass graves in Celje; the exact number is still not known. At the nearby concentration camp at Teharje, some 5,000 Slovenians, hundreds of them minors, were murdered within two months after {{the end of the}} war, again without trial. Furthermore, refugee trains carrying German civilians from the Rann triangle area were halted near Celje on 5 August 1945 and their passengers sent to a concentration camp at Teharje. After the camp was closed in 1950, the local authorities established a large <b>industrial</b> <b>dump</b> over the graveyard there, concealing the evidence of killings under a mound of toxic waste. In the mid-1970s, 30 years after crimes, the local authorities built preschools, schools, apartment blocks, halls and other structures on top of the mass graves. In 1991, when it became possible again to discuss the facts pertaining to the massacre, the Slovenian government decided to build a memorial to the victims of Teharje.|$|E

40|$|Chlorophenols {{contamination}} {{is serious}} {{concern to the}} environment due toxicity to all forms of life. Among all the chlorophenols, pentachlorophenol (PCP) is more detrimental to the environment. Pentachlorophenol used as pesticide, herbicide, antifungal agent and wood preservative which causes environmental pollution. In the present research a PCP degrading bacterium was isolated and characterized from <b>industrial</b> <b>dump</b> site. This isolate used PCP as its sole source of carbon and energy and was capable of degrading this compound, as indicated by stoichiometric release of chloride, ring cleavage activity and biomass formation. Based on morphological, biochemical and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis this strain was identified as Enterobacter sp. SG 1. Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis revealed that this strain was able to degrade PCP up to a concentration of 2 mM. This study showed that the removal efficiency of PCP by SG 1 {{was found to be}} very effective and can be used in degradation of PCP contaminated site or waste in the environment...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} the determination of the optimal experimental conditions for processing spent commercial zeolites in order to recover lanthanide elements and eventually other elements. The process is based on the fusion of the sample with potassium hydrogenosulfate (KHSO 4). Three experimental parameters were studied: temperature, reaction time and catalyst/flux mass ratio. After fusion the solid was dissolved in water and the amount of insoluble matter was used to determine the efficiency of the process. The optimized experimental parameters depend on the composition of the sample processed. Under such conditions the insoluble residue corresponds to SiO 2. Lanthanide elements and aluminum present in solution were isolated by conventional precipitation techniques; the yields were at least 75 wt%. The final generated wastes correspond to neutral colorless solutions containing alkali chlorides/sulfates and solids that can be disposed of in <b>industrial</b> <b>dumps...</b>|$|R
