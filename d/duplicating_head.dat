40|$|Globozoospermia is an {{infrequent}} pathology {{in which}} spermatozoa lack acrosomes. Patients are considered sterile without IVF augmented with {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} (ICSI), as fertilization is impaired due to absence of oocyte activation. As far as is known, {{this is the first}} study to report results of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of the semen parameters, sperm DNA fragmentation, aneuploidy, transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting and immunofluorescence for detection of phospholipase C zeta (PLCzeta), as well as ICSI outcome, of an affected patient. Morphological evaluation and transmission electron microscopy revealed complete globozoospermia with significant <b>duplicate</b> <b>heads</b> and tails. Analysis for DNA damage revealed fragmentation rates of approximately 80 % in semen and 15 - 23 % in swim-up fractions. PLCzeta was not detected by immunofluorescence or Western blotting. Aneuploidy rates were within normal ranges. ICSI followed by oocyte activation with calcium ionophore resulted in high rates of fertilization, and an ongoing pregnancy was established after transfer of cryopreserved-thawed embryos...|$|R

40|$|The annelidTubifex tubifex is a {{cosmopolitan}} freshwater oligochaete {{and a member}} of the Spiralia, a large group of invertebrate phyla displaying spiral development. Because its developing eggs are easily obtained in the laboratory, this animal has long been used as material for developmental studies, especially spiralian embryology. In spiralian embryos, it has long been known that one blastomere at the four-cell stage, the D cell, and its direct descendants play an important role in axial pattern formation. Various studies have suggested that the D quadrant functions as the organizer of the embryonic axes in molluscs and annelids, and it has recently been demonstrated that the D quadrant micromeres, 2 d 11 and 4 d, which had been transplanted to an ectopic position in an otherwise intact embryo induce a secondary embryonic axis to give rise to the formation of <b>duplicated</b> <b>heads</b> and/or tails. That 2 d and 4 d play a pivotal role in Tubifex embryonic development was first suggested from the classic cell-ablation experiments carried out in the early 1920 s, and this has been confirmed by the recent cell-ablation/restoration experiments using cell-labeling with lineage tracers. These studies have also shown that in the operated embryos, none of the remaining cells can replace the missing 2 d and 4 d and that both 2 d and 4 d are determined as ectodermal and mesodermal precursors, respectively, at the time of their birth. The anteroposterior polarity of these micromeres is also specified at the time of their birth, suggesting that nascent 2 d and 4 d are specified in their axial properties as well as in cell fate decision...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} characteristics of bifid mandibular condyle (BMC) using computed tomography (CT) evaluation. Study Design: A retrospective study was carried out using the CT records of 550 patients referred to the Medical School of Erciyes University (Kayseri, Turkey) between 2007 and 2010. T-tests were used to compare frequency of BMC between {{the left and right}} sides and between female and male patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software and a chi-squared test. Results: Of the 550 Patients, 10 patients (1. 82 %) were found to have BMCs. Five patients were female (50 %) and five were male (50 %). Of these 10 patients, 7 (70 %) had unilateral and 3 (30 %) had bilateral BMCs. As a result, a total of 13 BMCs were found in 10 patients. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} either the right- and left-sided BMCs or between female and male patients (p >. 05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first retrospective study investigating the prevalence and characteristics of BMC using computed tomography. Although BMC is an uncommon anomaly, it may be a more frequent condition in the Turkish population. Further studies and research on the orientation of <b>duplicated</b> condylar <b>heads</b> should be carried out...|$|R

Eventually, her quest to undertake the biggest catch of her career, will turn out greater, more perilous, more dangerous- yet more important, and even more rewarding- than she imagines.|$|R
40|$|LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 is a PhenylEthynyl-Terminated Imide resin {{developed}} at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) during the 1990 s. It offers {{a combination of}} attractive composite and adhesive properties. IM 7 /LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 composites exhibit thermal and thermo-oxidative stability typical of polyimides, superior chemical resistance and processability, excellent mechanical properties, toughness and damage tolerance. It was selected for study in the High Speed Research program aimed at developing technologies for a future supersonic aircraft, the High Speed Civil Transport, with a projected life span of 60 000 h at a cruise speed up to Mach 2. 4. Robust autoclave processing cycles for LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 composites have been thoroughly designed and demonstrated, which involved hand lay-up of solvent-ladened 'wet' prepregs. However, this type of processing is not only costly but also environmentally unfriendly. Volatile management and shrinkage could become serious problems in the fabrication of large complex airframe structural subcomponents. Robotic tow placement technology utilizing 'dry' material forms represents a new fabrication process which overcomes these deficiencies. This work evaluates and compares mechanical properties of composites fabricated by heated head automated tow placement (dry process) with those obtained by hand lay-up/autoclave fabrication (wet process). Thermal and rheological properties of the robotically as-placed uncured composites were measured. A post-cure cycle was designed due to the requirement of the PETI- 5 resin for a 370 C/ 1 h hold to reach full cure, conditions which cannot be <b>duplicated</b> during heated <b>head</b> robotic placement. Mechanical properties such as 0 degree flexural strength and modulus, open hole tensile and compressive strength and moduli, reduced section compression dogbone compressive strength, and modified zippora-medium small (MZ-MS) tensile and compressive properties were obtained on the post-cured panels. These properties compared favourably with those obtained from the wet process...|$|R
6000|$|Now let me draw {{breath and}} curse the negro waiter and through him the negro in service generally. He {{has been made}} a citizen with a vote; {{consequently}} both political parties play with him. But that is neither here nor there. He will commit in one meal every bÃ©tise that a scullion fresh from the plough-tail is capable of, and {{he will continue to}} repeat those faults. He is as complete a heavy-footed, uncomprehending, bungle-fisted fool as any memsahib in the East ever took into her establishment. But he is according to law a free and independent citizen--consequently above reproof or criticism. He, and he alone, in this insane city will wait at table (the Chinaman doesn't count). He is untrained, inept, but he will fill the place and draw the pay. Now God and his father's Kismet made him intellectually inferior to the Oriental. He insists on pretending that he serves tables by accident--as a sort of amusement. He wishes you to understand this little fact. You wish to eat your meals, and if possible to have them properly served. He is a big, black, vain baby and a man rolled into one. A coloured gentleman who insisted on getting me pie when I wanted something else, demanded information about India. I gave him some facts about wages. [...] "Oh hell," [...] said he, cheerfully, [...] "that wouldn't keep me in cigars for a month." [...] Then he fawned on me for a ten-cent piece. Later he took it upon himself to pity the natives of India--"heathen" [...] he called them, this Woolly One whose race has been the butt of every comedy on the Asiatic stage since the beginning. And I turned and saw by the head upon his shoulders that he was a Yoruba man, if there be any truth in ethnological castes. He did his thinking in English, but he was a Yoruba negro, and the race type had remained the same throughout his generations. And the room was full of other races--some that looked exactly like Gallas (but the trade was never recruited from that side of Africa), some <b>duplicates</b> of Cameroon <b>heads,</b> and some Kroomen, if ever Kroomen wore evening dress. The American does not consider little matters of descent, though by this time he ought to know all about [...] "damnable heredity." [...] As a general rule he keeps himself very far from the negro and says unpretty things about him. There are six million negroes more or less in the States, and they are increasing. The Americans once having made them citizens cannot unmake them. He says, in his newspapers, they ought to be elevated by education. He is trying this: but {{it is like to be}} a long job, because black blood is much more adhesive than white, and throws back with annoying persistence. When the negro gets a religion he returns, directly as a hiving bee, to the first instincts of his people. Just now a wave of religion is sweeping over some of the Southern States. Up to the present, two Messiahs and one Daniel have appeared; and several human sacrifices have been offered up to these incarnations. The Daniel managed to get three young men, who he insisted were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, to walk into a blast furnace; guaranteeing non-combustion. They did not return. I have seen nothing of this kind, but I have attended a negro church. The congregation were moved by the spirit to groans and tears, and one of them danced up the aisle to the mourners' bench. The motive may have been genuine. The movements of the shaken body were those of a Zanzibar stick-dance, such as you see at Aden on the coal boats; and even as I watched the people, the links that bound them to the white man snapped one by one, and I saw before me--the hubshi (the Woolly One) praying to the God he did not understand. Those neatly dressed folk on the benches, the grey-headed elder by the window, were savages--neither more nor less. What will the American do with the negro? The South will not consort with him. In some States miscegenation is a penal offence. The North is every year less and less in need of his services. And he will not disappear. He will continue as a problem. His friends will urge that he is as good as the white man. His enemies ... it is not good to be a negro in the land of the free and the home of the brave.|$|R
