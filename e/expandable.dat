5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, <b>expandable</b> upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour docked {{with the}} ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, {{bringing}} four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the {{first pair of}} U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included <b>expandable</b> metal girders, batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for <b>expandable</b> storage, the initial absence of {{cellular}} connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV243a) it had the same <b>expandable</b> format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E
5|$|Vålerenga {{has stated}} {{that they want to}} {{relocate}} and have conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin, where the club currently have their administration and training facilities. Plans exist for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be <b>expandable</b> to 32,000. Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that Vålerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located {{in the heart of the}} west side. As an alternative, Vålerenga has considered moving back to Bislett, at least as a temporary solution.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a {{scientist}} after becoming {{a member of the}} Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an <b>expandable</b> rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time <b>expandable</b> mission use.|$|E
5|$|Tange further {{developed}} his ideas for <b>expandable</b> urban forms in 1966 when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kōfu. It {{was designed for}} three media companies: a newspaper printing plant, a radio station and a television studio. To allow for future expansion Tange grouped the similar functions of three offices together in three zones. The newspaper printing machinery {{was on the ground}} floor, sealed studios on the upper floors and offices on glass walled floors surrounded by balconies. The services, including stairs and lifts, are housed in 16reinforced concrete columns that are of five-metre (17ft) diameter. Space was left between the cluster of functional space to allow for future expansion, although these have been used for gardens and terraces.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an <b>expandable</b> library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and <b>expandable</b> screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. <b>Expandable</b> screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, <b>expandable</b> screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the Witness Protection and Firearms Section also carry an ASP <b>expandable</b> baton and a small pepper spray for less-lethal options for {{protection}} on the field.|$|E
25|$|However, {{film critic}} David Daegling speculates {{that the same}} effect could be had by gluing the hair {{to a set of}} tight but <b>expandable,</b> waffle-design long johns.|$|E
25|$|Police {{also often}} carry an impact weapon - a baton, {{also known as}} a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been {{replaced}} in many locations by <b>expandable</b> batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock <b>Expandable</b> Baton or ASP baton. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle night stick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use less-lethal weapons like mace, pepper spray, electroshock guns, and beanbag shotgun rounds.|$|E

25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and <b>expandable</b> by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by <b>expandable</b> ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{developed}} independently, CyBLiSS {{would be}} complementary to other BLSS projects (such as MELiSSA) {{as it can}} connect them to materials found on Mars, thereby making them sustainable and <b>expandable</b> there.

25|$|The Mars Pathfinder {{conducted}} different investigations on the Martian soil {{using three}} scientific instruments. The lander contained a stereoscopic camera with spatial filters on an <b>expandable</b> pole called Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), and the Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package (ASI/MET) which {{acts as a}} Mars meteorological station, collecting data about pressure, temperature, and winds. The MET structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole, the topmost at about one meter (yard) and generally registered winds from the West.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Alitalia {{signed a}} {{partnership}} with KLM which aimed at a merger. The aim of the partnership was to develop Malpensa as a hub, along with Amsterdam (which lacked enough landing slots to expand further) and Rome Fiumicino. The problem was that in Milan there are two airports: Milan Linate (close to city centre but small) and Milan Malpensa (far from city but large and <b>expandable).</b> The Italian Government planned to move all flights to Milan Malpensa, apart from Milan-Rome Fiumicino.|$|E
