5000|$|An {{ignition}} switch or starter switch is a switch {{in the control}} system of an internal combustion engined motor vehicle that activates the main electrical systems for the vehicle. Besides providing power to the starter solenoid and the ignition system components (including the engine control unit and ignition coil) it also usually switches on power to many [...] "accessories" [...] (radio, power windows, etc.). The {{ignition switch}} usually requires a key be inserted that works a lock built into the switch mechanism. It is frequently combined with the starter switch which activates the starter motor. The <b>ignition</b> <b>locking</b> system may be bypassed by disconnecting the wiring to the switch and manipulating it directly; {{this is known as}} hotwiring.|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} key {{identification}} {{is similar in}} most automotive transponder systems. Once a key is inserted into the <b>ignition</b> <b>lock</b> and turned {{to one of the}} 'on' or 'run' positions, the induction coil that is mounted around the <b>ignition</b> <b>lock</b> sends out an electromagnetic field of energy. The windings in the transponder chip absorb that energy and power the electronic chip to emit a signal. The signal is usually an alphanumeric sequence which is considered the identification code. The induction coil reads the signal and sends it to some type of computer device to recognize the signal. If the signal is recognized as being already in the computer’s memory, the signal is accepted and other electronic components in the vehicle are set into motion to allow the starting of the vehicle or the continuation of the engine running.|$|E
50|$|A larger radiator, {{heater core}} inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and <b>ignition</b> <b>lock</b> switches were also revised for greater theft protection.

40|$|Abstract: Motor vehicle theft {{is a major}} {{property}} crime problem tn Canada; however, studies of auto theft In Canada are limited. This paper reports {{on the results of}} the most recent Canadian study. The British Columbia Association of Chiefs of Police, In conjunction with personnel at the Insurance Company of British Columbia and the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University, explored the site-specific and sttuatlonal characteristics of auto theft In British Columbia in order to Inform potential auto theft reduction strategies. The study found that young offenders who target older, Japanese-manufactured vehicles with theft-vulnerable door and <b>ignition</b> <b>locks</b> are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the auto theft problem tn British Columbia. There was little evidence to suggest that auto stealing is carried out by organized, profit-motivated adult offenders. However, willful damage to stolen vehicles by thrill-seeking youths Is widespread and costly, and it contradicts the innocuous connotation of the term &quot;Joyrldlng. &quot; Findings suggest that automobile owners should protect their cars differently: Owners of older, Japanese-manufactured vehicles may be well advised to employ widely available, Inexpensive after market antt-theft devices such as steering wheel locks to deter opportunistic youth, while the owners of vehicles whose parts are highly sought after for resale will need to layer anti-theft technologies and be diligent guardians to better protect their vehicles against theft. The information learned In this study is forming the basts of a number of auto theft reduction Initiatives being undertaken jointly by police and Insuranc...|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{followed}} in subsequent centuries, as {{various types of}} <b>locks</b> (<b>ignition</b> devices) were invented. In the matchlock, the separate match cord was affixed to a spring-loaded pivot which could be tripped by a trigger. In the wheellock, a mechanism analogous to that used in today's cigarette lighters replaced the smoldering match cord. In the 17th century, the flintlock, which strikes a flint against steel, appeared. The flintlock remained the standard method of small arms ignition around two hundred years. In the 19th century, percussion caps were developed, followed shortly by modern integrated-primer cartridges, and hammers therefore traded their flint for firing pins.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the vehicle}} never {{underwent}} a generational facelift {{on the scale}} of the GAZ-21 (if one does not count its derivative successors), nonetheless the car was modernised during production. The early stage included removal of bonnet-mounted rear-view mirrors, new <b>ignition</b> and boot <b>locks.</b> The novel belt-speedometer proved too complicated and was replaced by a standard arrow-driven one, as was the fate of the engine cooling coupling that controlled the ventilator fan (proved unreliable, the ventilator would be permanently on, whilst warm air for cold starts would be manually controlled with venetian-type shutter). Additions included external comfort lights were on the rear pillar's chrome element, that turned on upon opening of rear doors.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 AMC went {{bankrupt}} and were {{taken over by}} Manganese Bronze Holdings which formed Norton-Villiers to oversee operations. At the time Norton was the only motorcycle marque in the company that was making money. The AJS and Matchless traditional single cylinder four-stroke models were finished. Matchless and AJS badged models, with Norton motors, were assembled till 1969. In 1968 all models had new carburettors, ignition systems and an <b>ignition</b> <b>lock.</b> The G15CS, N15CS and M33CS had improved cycle parts for 1968-69.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{changes for}} 1991 also {{included}} the Alpha Tech <b>ignition</b> <b>lock</b> cylinder, which incorporated a dual-bit key that was larger and thicker in size {{in comparison to}} the old single-bit lock cylinder system that had been used for years. The lock system was intended to be a stronger deterrent to vehicle theft, but constant problems were reported with the lock jamming. It was dropped after an improved dual-bit single key system was introduced for the 1995 model year and redesign.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{automobiles}} have keys with transponders {{hidden inside}} the plastic {{head of the}} key. The user of the car {{may not even be}} aware that the transponder is there, because there are no buttons to press. When a key is inserted into the <b>ignition</b> <b>lock</b> cylinder and turned, the car's computer sends a radio signal to the transponder. Unless the transponder replies with a valid code, the computer will not allow the engine to be started. Transponder keys have no battery; they are energized by the radio signal itself.|$|E
50|$|The styling {{difference}} from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of federally-mandated side marker lights: for {{the front of the}} car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door vent-windows were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major facelift with a new front end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new <b>locking</b> <b>ignition</b> switch/steering wheel.|$|R

Twin hood stripes were now available to highlight the new dual-bulged hood. The 4-4-2 numerals grew to nearly double their previous size. Optional disc brakes now had updated single-piston calipers. The exhaust manifolds featured a new center divider for better performance. Other changes to the engine were minimal, but the Turnpike Cruiser option was deleted. However, another high-performance engine was offered. Called the W-32, it came with the Forced Air Induction plumbing found on the W-30s, but it had a milder cam like the base engine. It was only available with an automatic, and 297 were built, including 25 sport coupes and convertibles each.|$|R
