The mutual interaction between blades and the time dependent 3 -D free wake was studied. Fairly good agreements between claculated blade surface pressure distribution and experimental results for two blade rotor in hover and four balde rotor in hover, descent, and level flight conditions were obtained. The real blade motion such as flapping, pitching, and lead-lag has {{been included in the}} present code. Therefore, no restrictions are placed on the prescribed blade motion. Blade pressure distribution results obtained for the two-blade ''Caradonna/Tung'' rotor and the four-blade BO 105 rotor in hover condition are in very good agreement with experimental data. The prediction for the two-blade rotor compares also quite well with results of Euler methods. In addition, the typical contraction of the wake in <b>hover</b> <b>state</b> {{has been successfully}} modeled with the present free wake model. Blade pressure predictions for the forward descent flight case of the BO 105 model rotor however show significant discrepancies from wind tunnel data in the first and fourth quadrant in which severe BVI occurs.

The effort to find the real reason and further reduce these discrepancy will be the subject of future investigations. (orig.)

This is analyzed numerically at low Reynolds numbers using a boundary element method. The area-incompressible vesicle exhibits bending elasticity. Forces due to adhesion or gravity oppose the hydrodynamic lift force driving the vesicle away from a wall. We investigate three cases. First, a neutrally buoyant vesicle is placed in the vicinity of a wall which acts only as a geometrical constraint. We find that the lift velocity is linearly proportional to shear rate and decreases with increasing distance between the vesicle and the wall.

40|$|Abstract: OS 4 (Omnidirectional Stationary Flying OUtstretched Robot) is an {{electrically}} powered four-rotor miniature helicopter developed towards fully autonomous operation in indoor/outdoor environments. The major {{goal of this}} research is {{the development and implementation of}} an active control system for a quadrotor helicopter. However, one has to consider seriously the design aspect in order to get rid of the hardware limitations and achieve control simplification. Controlling a VTOL (Vertical Taking-Off and Landing) flying robot is basically dealing with highly unstable dynamics and strong axes coupling. In addition to this, any additional on-board sensor increases the robot total weight and therefore decreases its operation time. It is necessary to find a balance between on-board electronics and robot operation time. This paper focuses the development and implementation of an obstacle avoidance controller for this miniature flying robot using four ultra-sound (US) sensors for detecting obstacles and one US sensor for controlling its altitude. In order to facilitate the controller implementation, we developed a simulation tool in Matlab/Simulink using an accurate dynamic model of OS 4. This tool allowed us to simulate and improve the OS 4 controllers in different modeled environments and applying different approaches.

40|$|In this thesis, black-box models {{describing}} the quadcopter system dynamics for attitude control have been estimated using closed-loop data. A quadcopter is a naturally unstable {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system {{and is therefore}} an interesting platform to test and evaluate ideas in system identification and control theory on. The estimated attitude models have been shown to explain the output signals well enough during simulations to properly tune a PID controller for outdoor flight purposes. With data collected in closed loop during outdoor flights, knowledge about the controller and IMU measurements, three decoupled models have been estimated for the angles and angular rates in roll, pitch and yaw. The models for roll and pitch have been forced to have the same model structure and orders since this reflects the geometry of the quadcopter. The models have been validated by simulating the closed-loop system where they could explain the output signals well. The estimated models have then been used to design attitude controllers to stabilize the quadcopter around the <b>hovering</b> <b>state.</b> Three PID controllers have been implemented on the quadcopter and evaluated in simulation before being tested during both indoor and outdoor flights. The controllers have been shown to stabilize the quadcopter with good reference tracking.

"May 2011 "The gravity-tractor (GT) consists of a spacecraft hovering inertially over a small asteroid. This equilibrium state is achieved by the action of a pair of engines that balance the gravitational acceleration. Due to Newton's law of gravitation the spacecraft causes a small gravitational pull on the asteroid that after prolonged time intervals causes a small change in its trajectory preventing it from impacting the Earth. This dissertation introduces a novel concept in the implementation of the GT to augment its deflection merits. Two novel guidance laws are designed {{to take advantage of the}} asteroid shape and rotation rate forcing the GT spacecraft to move towards and away the center of mass of the asteroid in synchronous motion with its rotation, resulting in an increased gravitational pull. The asteroid model was generalized as a solid, homogeneous triaxial ellipsoid. A small GT spacecraft was proposed and a detailed model of the NSTAR ion thrusters was used to investigate the efficiency of the GT operating under these novel guidance laws and the classical inertial hovering. The performance of these hovering laws was examined over a wide range of asteroid shapes and rotation rates. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to improve the deflection merits by up to 60 %. The propellant efficiency showed to be sensitive to the spacecraft parameters; in particular, the engine model and the controller used to sustain the desired <b>hovering</b> <b>state</b> play an important role in the propellant penalties associated with these extended hovering modes. Furthermore, these results indicate that previous works have overestimated the propellant efficiency of a typical GT by using oversimplified models of solar electric engines...|$|R

40|$|High-speed flow {{visualization}} and high-resolution particle image velocimetry {{experiments were}} conducted on a two-bladed rotor that was operated in a <b>hovering</b> <b>state,</b> both out of ground effect (well away from the ground) and in ground effect at several rotor heights. Recent advances in flow diagnostic instrumentation allowed measurements of the rotor wake to be performed with unprecedented levels of resolution. In particular, {{the goal of the}} present work was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the fluid dynamics of the wake sheets (and the blade tip vortices) that were trailed from the blades. The present work examined the effects produced by two blade sets: 1. A baseline untwisted blade, 2. A twisted blade with - 17 ^∘ of linear twist, and has revealed fluid dynamic details of the wake sheet that were hitherto unknown. For the measurements made with the rotor operating out of ground effect, the blade sets were tested at two blade loading coefficients of 0. 053 and 0. 08, although only the higher loading condition was tested with the rotors operating in ground effect. For the rotor operating out of ground effect, a helicoidal tip vortex was shown to form at the blade tip and the associated wake sheets were initially laid down as small-scale counterrotating vortical pairs. However, this initial vorticity quickly diffused and the sheet was then convected as a concentrated bands of turbulence, including several dominant eddies. Several types of sheet dynamics were documented in the rotor wake, including sheet interactions with the tip vortices, the detailed behavior of this interaction depending on both the blade twist and the rotor thrust. At earlier wake ages, a sinusoidal wave-like perturbation was seen to be formed on the wake sheets, although the growth in wave amplitude was limited as the sheets were convected and stretched in the velocity gradients in the downstream wake. When the rotor was operated in ground effect, the vorticity in the wake sheets persisted to much older wake ages. Wave-like perturbations did not form on the wake sheets when the rotors were operating in ground effect because the outward radial stretching of the rotor wake in the presence of the ground suppressed their development. The wake sheets were found to convect to the ground and introduce significant vorticity into the near-wall flow field closer to the rotor, contributing to fluctuations in the local flow velocities. The flow field near the ground was also observed to be significantly affected by the use of twist on the blade, with the wake impinging on the ground further inboard and closer to the rotor, which also resulted in higher flow velocities being produced further downstream...|$|R

The airline industry brought many residents from airline crew bases, as well as employment opportunities at the airport, which brought much prosperity to the city. This dependence, however, left the city vulnerable. The sudden 1991 collapses of both Eastern Airlines and Pan American World Airways left many Miami Springs residents unemployed and unable to afford living in the neighborhood. Given that the businesses in Miami Springs had always relied upon the large disposable incomes of the employees of the large airline carriers, the bankruptcy of both corporations in the same year created a chain reaction, eventually causing many small businesses to close their doors. Despite the closure of the airlines, from a residential standpoint, Miami Springs remained strong. The city is often seen as blessedly isolated from the perceived turbulence of the rest of Miami-Dade County. This has continued to provide ample replacements for the older residents who are lost over time. Nonetheless the legacy of the airline closures remains.

We rigorously analyze the benefit of adaptive re-planning for such problems, and we prove that the potential benefit of adaptivity can be reduced from an exponential to a constant factor by changing the problem from cost minimization with a constraint on information gain to variance reduction with a constraint on cost. Such analysis allows the use of robust, non-adaptive planning algorithms that perform competitively with adaptive algorithms. Based on our analysis, we propose a method for constructing 3 D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression.

Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader <b>hover</b> in a <b>state</b> between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, hoaxes, and general authorial self expression.|$|R
40|$|In The Logic of Sense (section 33) Gilles Deleuze defines novelists/artists as "clinicians of civilisation". Great {{authors are}} more like doctors than their {{patients}} - in that, like great clinicians, they create a set of disorders out of disorder, a table or grouping of symptoms out of disparate symptoms, so that "it is not the [Freudian Oedipus] complex which provides us with information about Oedipus and Hamlet, but rather Oedipus and Hamlet who provide us with information about the complex". For Deleuze, this creation of disorders takes on a particular character. In truth, for him, these structurings are not created from "disorder", since that would be to define the "choasmos" of differences - "disorder" in common parlance - {{by means of the}} notion of order; that is, it would be to define differences in terms of sameness - something he had spent the whole of his preceding book, Difference and Repetition, battling against. Thus the creation of disorders can only occur within a field where originary difference has been proclaimed and acknowledged, and where every notion of the same or the one is derived from, or "said of" (as he puts it) that which always and from the start differs. The exemplary novelist - Deleuze cites Joyce's Ulysses, Proust and Robbe-Grillet - disposes within this original difference two heterogeneous series of signifier and signified (section 6). These two series resonate through a single homogenous series of names where each term can be seen to relate to the preceding one and the next one, thus: n 1 - n 2 - n 3 - n 4 [...] . The first name, or signifier, relates to the second name/signifier, relates to the third etc in the familiar continuous chain of signifiers. But it is the novelist's task to consider this homogenous chain instead {{from the point of view}} of "that which alternates in this succession" - ie the alternation of signified and signifier through the terms - and to allow these to resonate. In the case of Joyce, for instance, there is a series surrounding "Bloom" which is given as the signifying set; and a corresponding signified series "Ulysses"; between which the author establishes a resonance and relation by various means. In the case of Robbe-Grillet, the two series operate on the smaller scale of descriptions of tiny "states of affairs" against "rigorous designations". In all cases, it is for Deleuze the differences between the series and their terms which "become [through the auspices of the author] primary", not the resemblances. This paper will attempt a preliminary transposition of these Deleuzian strategies onto a creative spatial field. Can a place be disposed according to this strategy of primary difference, homogenous chain of signifiers and the creative diagnosis of two resonating, heterogeneous series? In this case, what would constitute the two aspects of sense? How does this relate to the stoic disjunctive logic of the state of affairs of bodies and the entirely other order of "events", which <b>hover</b> over <b>states</b> of affair as "the battle hovers over its own field" (section 15) ? It will be shown that the creation of a place must, like literature, stay true to Deleuze's words in Difference and Repetition: 	 [...] . [it] opens on to the difference of Being by taking its own difference as object - in other works, by posing the question of its own difference (p 195...|$|R
