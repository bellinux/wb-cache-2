The putative DEAH-box RNA helicase, HrpA, has been recently identified as an addition to the spirochete’s global regulatory machinery; using proteomic methods, we demonstrated that HrpA modulates the expression of at least 180 proteins.

40|$|A {{previously}} uncharacterizedSaccharomyces cerevisiaeopen reading frame, YNR 038 W, {{was analyzed}} {{in the context}} of the European Functional Analysis Network. YNR 038 W encodes a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD-box protein family and was therefore namedDBP 6 (DEAD-box protein 6). Dbp 6 p is essential for cell viability. In vivo depletion of Dbp 6 p results in a deficit in 60 S ribosomal subunits and the appearance of half-mer polysomes. Pulse-chase labeling of pre-rRNA and steady-state analysis of pre-rRNA and mature rRNA by Northern hybridization and primer extension show that Dbp 6 p depletion leads to decreased production of the 27 S and 7 S precursors, resulting in a depletion of the mature 25 S and 5. 8 S rRNAs. Furthermore, hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Dbp 6 p is detected exclusively within the nucleolus. We propose that Dbp 6 p is required for the proper assembly of preribosomal particles during the biogenesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits, probably by acting as an rRNA <b>helicas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Replicative helicases are {{essential}} molecular machines that utilize energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to move along nucleic acids and to unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Our earlier crystal {{structure of the}} hexameric helicase from Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA 426 (GkDnaC) in complex with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) suggested several key residues responsible for DNA binding that likely {{play a role in}} DNA translocation during the unwinding process. Here, we demonstrated that the unwinding activities of mutants with substitutions at these key residues in GkDnaC are 2 – 4 -fold higher than that of wildtype protein. We also observed the faster unwinding velocities in these mutants using single-molecule experiments. A partial loss in the interaction of helicase with ssDNA leads to an enhancement in helicase efficiency, while their ATPase activities remain unchanged. In strong contrast, adding accessory proteins (DnaG or DnaI) to GkDnaC helicase alters the ATPase, unwinding efficiency and the unwinding velocity of the helicase. It suggests that the unwinding velocity of <b>helicas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two cancer {{predisposition}} disorders {{observed in}} humans, Werner syndrome (WS) and Bloom syndrome (BS), {{are caused by}} loss of function of the RecQ helicases WRN or BLM, respectively. BS and WS are characterized by replication defects, hyper-recombination events and chromosomal aberrations, which are hallmarks of cancer. Our lab has shown how inefficient replication of the G-rich telomeric strand contributes to chromosome aberrations in WS cells, demonstrating a link between WRN, telomeres and genomic stability. Here I provide evidence that the BLM RecQ helicase also contributes to chromosome-end maintenance. Chromosome fusions and telomeric defects are elevated in fibroblasts lacking BLM; these aberrations are suppressed by hTERT- mediated telomere elongation, confirming a telomere-specific dysfunction in BS cells. Examination of metaphase chromosomes showed that telomere defects are significantly greater in BLM-deficient cells, similar to observations in cells lacking a functional WRN helicase. Furthermore, loss of both helicases exacerbates telomere defects and chromosome aberrations, indicating that BLM and WRN function independently in telomere maintenance. Fluorescence analysis revealed that BLM localization, particularly its recruitment to telomeres, changes in response to replication dysfunction. WRN deficiency or aphidicolin exposure led {{to an increase in}} late- replicating intermediates, observed as BLM-positive ultra- fine bridges (UFBs), particularly UFBs originating from telomeric DNA. I propose that the BLM RecQ helicase (likely in complex with the proteins TOPOIII[alpha], RMI 1, RMI 2) contributes to telomere maintenance, though most likely in a capacity distinct from WRN RecQ <b>helicas...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Helica</b> TC {{has been}} shown to be a safe, {{cost-effective}} and successful way of treating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain laparoscopically [13, 27]. Unlike laser therapy or electrosurgery, the <b>Helica</b> TC minimises tissue ischaemia, charring and desiccation, which are potential causes of adhesions and persistent pelvic pain and infertility [11, 12, 28]. <b>Helica</b> TC may have a more rapid healing rate due to its limited depth of penetration and ability to precisely dissect adhesions as well as their reduced recurrence rate. Pelvic adhesions can impair oocyte release from the ovary and inhibit ovum pick up or transport [29]. The <b>Helica</b> TC can be performed at the time of diagnosis at laparoscopy, and as shown in our study, the pregnancy rate is highest in 2 – 6  months post-treatment.|$|E
30|$|<b>Helica</b> TC {{seems to}} be a safe, cheap and {{effective}} short-term surgical treatment for women suffering with minimal to mild endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and infertility.

It therefore appears that <b>Helica</b> TC is an effective short-term treatment for chronic pelvic pain associated with minimal to mild endometriosis, and patients {{need to be aware of}} this possible short-term benefit. The recurrence of symptoms can be due to the superficial effect of <b>Helica</b> on the endometriotic implants resulting in possible incomplete treatment.|$|E

30|$|Early-stage endometriosis is a known {{contributing}} factor for chronic pelvic pain and sub-fertility. To determine whether <b>Helica</b> Thermal Coagulation {{is an effective}} short- and long-term treatment for endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain and sub-fertility. Thirty six patients were followed up from 6  weeks to 1  year post-Helica treatment of early endometriosis. Pain relief was assessed subjectively. Eight of the women suffered from sub-fertility in addition to pelvic pain, while three patients suffered from sub-fertility alone. Ninety-three percent were pain free at 6  weeks, 75  % were pain free at 6  months and 37.5  % remained pain free at 1 -year follow-up. Of those who continued to have pain at 1 -year follow-up, three had repeated <b>Helica</b> treatment, two had hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoopherectomy, and the rest were commenced on different hormonal treatment to control endometriosis. Ten women (62  %) conceived within 1  year of treatment. <b>Helica</b> coagulation {{seems to be an}} effective way of treating early endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and sub-fertility.

40|$|Abstract. Freeze-etch {{preparation}} of the laminated bundles of microtubules in motile axostyles demonstrates that the cross-bridges populating individual layers or laminae are structurally similar to the dynein arms of cilia and flagellae. Also, like dynein, they are extracted by high salt and undergo a change in tilt upon removal of endogenous ATP (while the axostyle as a whole straightens and becomes stiff). On the other hand, the bridges running between adjacent microtubule laminae in the axostyle {{turn out to be}} much more delicate and wispy in appearance, and display no similarity to dynein arms. Thus we propose that the internal or "intra-laminar " cross-bridges are the active force-generating ATPases in this system, and that they generate overall bends or changes in the <b>helica...</b>|$|E

Substantial heating was observed for all densities. In the low-density plasma (less than 0. 4 x l 0 ^ 19 m^- 3) ion-cyclotron-wave (shear Alfven wave) heating was effective. For high-density plasmas, a fast-wave should be excited, {{and in this case}} also, effective heating was observed with the presence of the NBI beam component. The wave damping mechanism may be attributed to the finite gyro-radius effect on beam ions by the right-handed polarized wave. The experimental results were compared with an analysis using the ful 1 -wave code. The heating performance was a little worse than that of the usual two-ion hybrid-heating mode. ...|$|E
40|$|Roles of bumpy {{field on}} collisionless {{particle}} confinement in <b>helica</b> 1 -axis heliotrons are investigated with the model magnetic field and particle orbit calculations in the Boozer coordinates.

The area of closed mod-B_min contours is a useful measure to evaluate global collisionless particle confinement as long as the mod-B_min contours connect toroidally. Negative value of ratio between the bumpy and the helicity components contributes to obtain the largest area of closed mod-B_min contours for finite ratio between the toroidicity and the helicity components. The radial variation of the bumpy field attributes to realize a toroidally localized mod-B_min Structure, which is significantly effective to improve collisionless particle confinement. ...|$|E
