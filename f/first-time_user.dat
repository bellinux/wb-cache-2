The {{goals were}} to {{evaluate}} the use of touchscreen computer kiosks, containing only child health 9 ̆ 6 promoting information, in urban, low-income, community settings and to characterize the users of these kiosks. METHODS. Three user-driven touchscreen computer kiosks were placed in low-income urban locations in Seattle, Washington, from March 2005 to October 2005. The locations included a public library, a Department of Motor Vehicles office, and a McDonald's restaurant. Users selected age-appropriate modules with prevention information and screening tools. Users entered the age of the child and were presented with age-appropriate modules. On exiting, users were asked to rate their experience and to provide basic demographic data. RESULTS. In total, there were 1846 kiosk sessions. Almost one half occurred at McDonald's. Seventy-eight percent of users identified themselves as <b>first-time</b> <b>users.</b> Users sought information for children of all ages. Sixty-one percent of <b>first-time</b> <b>users</b> explored 1 module. <b>First-time</b> <b>users</b> were most interested in television/media use (16...|$|R

[...] "It was used very successfully for ten years in psychoanalysis," [...] he said, adding that the drug was misused by the Counterculture of the 1960s, and then criticized unfairly by the political establishment of the day.

50|$|In {{computer}} science, a <b>first-time</b> <b>user</b> experience (FTUE) {{refers to}} {{the initial stages of}} using a piece of software. Of particular importance are the configuration steps, such as signing up for an email account, or configuring a DVR. Every user of a service has his/her own FTUE, even if he/she has extensive experience with using a similar product. Patience, time investment, and intuitiveness are factors for a user's FTUE. Software services generally have different layouts, styles, graphics, and hotkeys which must be identified to contribute to a user's learning, mastery, and efficiency of the software. The FTUE is responsible for setting the stage for the experience of the user when interacting with a product down the line. This differs from the out-of-box experience (OOBE), which is specifically about packaging, information presentation, and setup of the system out of the box.|$|E
5000|$|User-centered design (UCD) or user-driven {{development}} (UDD) is {{a framework}} of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. User-centered design {{can be characterized as}} a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product, but also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests. These tests are conducted with/without actual users during each stage of the process from requirements, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that [...] "development proceeds with the user as the center of focus." [...] Such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of a product to understand intuitively what a <b>first-time</b> <b>user</b> of their design experiences, and what each user's learning curve may look like.|$|E

5000|$|Injection, {{also known}} as [...] "slamming", [...] "banging", [...] "shooting up", [...] "digging" [...] or [...] "mainlining", is a popular method which carries {{relatively}} greater risks than other methods of administration. Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection, will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the femoral vein in the groin. Users who have used this route of administration often develop a deep vein thrombosis. Intravenous users can use a various single dose range using a hypodermic needle. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes {{is dependent on the}} frequency and level of use: thus a <b>first-time</b> <b>user</b> may use between 5 and 20 mg, while an established addict may require several hundred mg per day. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users share a common needle without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, can be transmitted.The use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and/or filters can also cause the spread of blood-borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order {{to prevent the spread of}} disease.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} if continuation {{rates in}} <b>first-time</b> <b>users</b> of oral hormonal contraceptives differed between different formulations and to measure if the rates {{were related to}} the prescribing categories, that is, physicians and midwives.                                  Design A longitudinal national population-based registry study.                                  Setting The Swedish prescribed drug register.                                  Participants All women born between 1977 and 1994 defined as <b>first-time</b> <b>users</b> of hormonal contraceptives from 2007 to 2009 (n= 226   211).                                  Main outcome measures A tendency to switch the type of hormonal contraceptive within 6  months use and repeated dispensation identical to the first were estimated as percentages and relative risks (RRs). Physicians’ and midwives’ prescription patterns concerning the women's                                    continuation rates of oral hormonal contraceptive type.                                  Results In Sweden, there were 782   375 women born between 1977 and 1994 {{at the time of the}} study. Of these, 226   211 women were identified as <b>first-time</b> <b>users</b> of hormonal contraceptives. Ethinylestradiol+levonorgestrel, desogestrel-only and ethinylestradiol+drospirenone were the hormonal contraceptives most commonly dispensed to <b>first-time</b> <b>users</b> at rates of 43. 3 %, 24. 4 % and 11. 1 %, respectively.  The overall rate of switching contraceptive types in the first 6  months was 11. 3 %, which was highest for desogestrel-only (14. 3 %) and lowest for ethinylestradiol+drospirenone (6. 6 %). The switching rate for all three products was highest in the  16 -year to 19 -year age group. Having a repeated dispensation identical to the initial dispensation was highest for users of ethinylestradiol either combined with levonorgestrel or drospirenone, 81. 4 % and 81. 2 %, respectively, whereas this rate for the initial desogestrel-only users was 71. 5 %. The RR of switching of contraceptive type within the first 6  months was 1. 35 (95 % CI 1. 32 to 1. 39) for desogestrel-only and 0. 63 (0. 59 to 0. 66) for ethinylestradiol+drospirenone compared with ethinylestradiol+levonorgestrel as the reference category. There were no differences in the women's continuation rates depending on the prescriber categories.                                  Conclusions Desogestrel-only users conferred the highest switcher rate to another hormonal contraceptive within a 6 -month period. Users of ethinylestradiol+levonorgestrel were more prone to switch to another product within 6  months than women using ethinylestradiol+drospirenone. These findings may be of clinical importance when tailoring hormonal contraceptives on an individual basis...|$|R
