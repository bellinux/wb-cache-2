The results show the variation of peak value of concentration of NH 4 +-N in topsoil is: drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water > drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> 50 % reclaimed water > drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> groundwater, the concentration of NH 4 +-N is higher at the depth of 0 - 40 cm with almost no accumulation of NH 4 +-N below the depth of 40 cm NO 3 -N presence in soil slightly increases across the entire growth period with <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water increases tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency, and has an improved taste index indicated by an improved soluble sugar and titratable acidity content of the fruit without any obvious adverse influence on the nutritive indexes such as Vc soluble solid. The shortening of the irrigation period and increase in buried depth of drip irrigation tape are to promote an increase in tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency to carry out drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> reclaimed water under the condition of having a shorter irrigation period and a greater depth of drip irrigation tape and to yield a higher rate of water conservation.

40|$|Regions {{of scarce}} fresh water resources, {{such as the}} Middle East and North Africa, are facing great {{challenges}} already today, and even more in the future, due to climatic and socioeconomic changes. The Middle Drâa valley in Morocco {{is one of many}} semi-arid to arid mountainous areas struggling with increasing water scarcity threatening self-sufficient husbandry. In order to maintain people’s livelihoods water management needs to be adapted. The Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) software has been widely used to examine complex water systems in the water resource planning sector all around the world and proved to be a helpful asset to show the various interactions of water supply and demand. This paper presents the application of WEAP on the Middle Draâ valley’s water demand and supply, including several socioeconomic and land use scenarios under one basic climate change scenario. The climate scenario shows a significant decrease in available water resources up to 2029 while all socioeconomic scenarios show an increase in water demand. In years of droughts groundwater is used for irrigation, leading to increasingly depleted aquifers. The aquifers are recharged by percolation losses from <b>irrigation</b> and <b>by</b> river <b>bed</b> infiltration the latter of which is stronger in the northern oases than in the southern oases due to water withdrawal rules. A drastic reduction of irrigated agricultural area is the only solution to guarantee sustainable water use...|$|R

The study included two regimes of bio-fertilizers (without bio-fertilization and bio-fertilization with Microbein as Pseudomonnas sp., Azotobacter sp., Azospirillum sp. and B. megaterium) and four irrigation schedule depth (mm) (without supplementary irrigation(rainfed), supplementary <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> 60 mm/fed, supplementary <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> 90 mm/fed and supplementary <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> 120 mm/fed), all under rainfed conditions.

40|$|Stochastic {{efficiency}} {{with respect}} to an exponential utility function {{was used to determine}} utility-efficient water-conserving irrigation schedules for wheat and maize based on certainty equivalents. Total gross margin risk resulting from production risk of alternative deficit irrigation practices was quantified using an irrigation simulation model and stochastic budgeting procedures. Results showed increasing production variability with increasing levels of deficit irrigation, especially when rainfall has significant potential to contribute to the production process. Risk-averse decision makers are more willingly to adopt deficit irrigation schedules for maize due to increased effective rainfall. The conclusion is that the potential to use rainfall more effectively through deficit irrigation is a key variable determining adoption of deficit <b>irrigation</b> strategies <b>by</b> risk-averse decision makers. Localized weather forecasts may improve acceptance of deficit <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> risk-averse decision makers.

40|$|Response {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Shatabdi) to {{irrigation}} water of five salinity levels was investigated at the Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) farm {{with a view}} to search for a possible advantageous salinity level for the crop. The experiment comprised five treatments − I 1 : <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> fresh water of background salinity 0. 385 dS m− 1 (control) and I 2 − I 5 : <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> synthetic saline water (prepared by mixing sodium chloride salt with fresh water) of electrical conductivity (EC) 4, 7, 10 and 13 dS m− 1 (at 25 oC), respectively. Wheat was grown under three irrigations applied at maximum tillering, booting and milking/grain filling stages, and with recommended fertilizer dose. Irrigation water of EC ≥ 10 dS m− 1 significantly (p = 0. 05) suppressed most growth and yield attributes, and yield of wheat compared to <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> fresh water (I 1). An attention-grabbing observation was that <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> saline water of 4 dS m− 1 (I 2) contributed positively to the crop attributes. Leaf area index (LAI), spike length, spikelets and grains per spike, 1000 -grain weight and above ground dry matter (ADM) of wheat increased by 1. 9 − 3. 4, 0. 9, 2. 6, 7. 4, 2. 1 and 2. 8 − 6. 0 %, respectively in I 2 compared to the control. The improvement in the LAI and ADM in I 2 was significant over I 1. Because of the largest spike density, the utmost grain (3. 85 t ha− 1), straw (5. 09 t ha− 1) and biomass (8. 93 t ha− 1) yields of wheat were however obtained under I 1.
