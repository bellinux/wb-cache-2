5|$|Namaka is only 1.5% {{as bright}} as its parent dwarf planet Haumea and is about 0.05% <b>its</b> <b>mass.</b> If {{it turns out to}} have a similar albedo, it would be about 170km in diameter. Photometric {{observations}} indicate that its surface is made of water ice.|$|E
5|$|Thebe is irregularly shaped, {{with the}} closest {{ellipsoidal}} approximation being 116×98×84km. Its surface area is probably between 31,000 and 59,000 (~45,000) km2. Its bulk density and mass are not known, but assuming that its mean density {{is like that}} of Amalthea (around 0.86g/cm3), <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> can be estimated at roughly 4.3kg.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the mid-20th century, {{estimates}} of Pluto's mass were revised downward. In 1931, Nicholson and Mayall calculated <b>its</b> <b>mass,</b> {{based on its}} supposed effect on the giant planets, as roughly that of Earth; a value somewhat {{in accord with the}} 0.91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. Wylie at the US Naval Observatory, using the same assumptions. In 1949, Gerard Kuiper's measurements of Pluto's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> was most probably about 0.1 Earth mass.|$|E
5|$|Use of the Magellan Clay telescope's Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle {{spectrograph}} (MIKE) helped collect sixteen {{radial velocity}} measurements for HD 154672; {{a team of}} American astronomers and one from the Vatican City used these measurements to confirm the existence of planet HD 154672 b and to determine <b>its</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured {{on opposite sides of}} the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, <b>its</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among {{the smallest of}} the Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. <b>Its</b> <b>mass</b> is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to <b>its</b> <b>mass,</b> the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> increases.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> and the motion of its stars.|$|E

5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. <b>Its</b> <b>mass</b> number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{the largest}} and most massive moon in the Solar System. Its {{diameter}} of 5,268km is 0.41 times that of Earth, 2% larger than that of Saturn's Titan (the second-largest moon), 1.08 times Mercury's, 1.09 times Callisto's, 1.45 times Io's and 1.51 times the Moon's. <b>Its</b> <b>mass</b> is 10% greater than Titan's, 38% greater than Callisto's, 66% greater than Io's and 2.02 times that of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> {{it is likely}} to have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>its</b> <b>mass</b> and modeled geochemistry, {{researchers have also}} examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
