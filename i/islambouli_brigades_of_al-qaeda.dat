50|$|Prior to his {{disappearance}} and murder, journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad {{wrote in}} the Asia Times Online that al-Qaeda carried out the attack after negotiations with the Navy {{for the release of}} officials, suspected <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> links, had failed.

5000|$|The two almost {{simultaneous}} crashes caused speculations about terrorism. President Vladimir Putin immediately {{ordered the}} Federal Security Service (FSB) {{to investigate the}} crashes. On 28 August 2004, the FSB had found traces of the explosive RDX in the remains of both planes. Itar-Tass news agency reported on 30 August 2004, [...] "without {{a shadow of a}} doubt, the FSB security service said that [...] "both airplanes were blown up {{as a result of a}} terrorist attack". A little known group called the <b>Islambouli</b> <b>Brigades</b> claimed responsibility; the truth of those claims remains uncertain. The <b>Islambouli</b> <b>Brigades</b> have also claimed that five of their members were on each plane; experts are skeptical about the possibility of (and the need for) so many terrorists on board.|$|R

Nagayeva's brother had disappeared three years earlier and the family believed he was abducted by Russian forces. Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev took responsibility for the bombings in an open letter published on the Chechen separatists' websites on 17 September 2004. He claimed that the aircraft bombings cost him US$4,000 in total. He has also denied the <b>Islambouli</b> <b>Brigade's</b> claims.|$|R
