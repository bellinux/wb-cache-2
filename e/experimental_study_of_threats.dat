40|$|In this <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> the {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> appeals in commercial advertisements on {{attitude toward the}} ad and purchase intention was tested. In addition hedonic and utilitarian products were compared to test the moderating impact of product type on threat appeal effectiveness. The results of the experiment showed that the ad with the threat appeal caused a significantly higher attitude toward the ad and purchase intention than an identical ad, but without the threat appeal. These effects were mediated by attention toward the ad and moderated by product type. A threat appeal {{is more effective than}} no threat appeal because it increases attention toward the ad. The positive effect <b>of</b> a <b>threat</b> appeal was stronger for the utilitarian product than for the hedonic product...|$|R
40|$|Language is {{a uniquely}} human behaviour, which has {{presented}} unique adaptive problems. Prominent among {{these is the}} transmission of information that may affect an individual’s reputation. The possibility of punishment of those with a low reputation by absent third parties has created a selective pressure on human beings that is not shared by any other species. This {{has led to the}} evolution of unique cognitive structures that are capable of handling such a novel adaptive challenge. One of these, we argue, is the propositional theory of mind, which enables individuals to model, and potentially manipulate, their own reputation in the minds of other group members, by representing the beliefs that others have about the first party’s intentions and actions. Support for our theoretical model is provided by an observational study on tattling in two preschools, and an <b>experimental</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> giving under <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> gossip in a dictator game...|$|R

He sees the concept of security as not either power or peace, but something in between.|$|R
