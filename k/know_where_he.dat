When he returns home, Jess finds that {{his father and mother}} were worried sick since they didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the devastating effects of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and {{has no choice but to}} accept Leslie's death.|$|E
60|$|I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived: I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was to {{be heard}} of, or communicated with; the {{distance}} was scarce a stone's-throw: had it been in the next room--unsummoned, I could make no use of my knowledge. To follow, to seek out, to remind, to recall--for these things I had no faculty.|$|R

Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> saw it.|$|E

5000|$|Burridge goes on {{to compare}} the ending of Mark to its beginning: Mark's {{narrative}} as we have it now ends as abruptly as it began. There was no introduction or background to Jesus' arrival, and none for his departure.

That was the last thing Tobares said to Ver칩nica.|$|E

25|$|In {{all three}} accounts, after Jesus {{got into the}} ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship {{immediately}} reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people {{from the other side}} of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of answering the question, he told the crowd that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.|$|E

25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., {{deputy director of the}} FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
25|$|According to Simon Wilde, part of {{the reason}} for Ranjitsinhji's reduced output in 1901 was the death in November 1900 of Rajinder Singh; the {{subsequent}} reduction in his income would have presented Ranjitsinhji with financial difficulties. By November 1901, Ranjitsinhji faced bankruptcy and after an unavailing request to Nawangar for a resumption and increase of his allowance, only an appeal to the India Office prevented a court action against him. Through his solicitor, Ranjitsinhji claimed that his debt to one creditor only came through his acting on behalf of Pratap Singh and Sardar Singh, the Maharaja of Jodhpur. In December, Ranjitsinhji travelled to India to attempt to secure financial guarantees from the council acting for Rajinder Singh's son and from Jodhpur but he was unsuccessful in his attempt to get the support of the Maharao of Kutch, who was sympathetic but unwilling to help; he nevertheless later received a request for a substantial sum of money which Ranjitsinhji claimed he had been promised. Ranjitsinhji's Indian trip caused him to miss the start of the 1902 season; no reason was given for his absence and the press and public did not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was.|$|E

500|$|Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{published}} anonymously with the credit granted to [...] "a Bostonian". His name, typically listed as [...] "Edgar A. Poe", was not published {{with his work}} until his second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in late 1829. Poe may {{have chosen not to}} give his name so that his foster father, John Allan, would not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was; moreover, his choice to embrace his Bostonian heritage may have been an attempt to distance himself from the Allan family in Richmond. Boston was, at the time, a center for publishing and the literary world. By the time the book was released, Poe was already in the Army.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Walter Bishop (John Noble) is at a graveyard, {{where he}} solemnly stares at an unknown gravestone.

When Olivia demands to speak to Bell, Nina explains that she does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, as Bell has been communicating these past few months [...] "strictly electronically". Nina believes Jones is trying to confront Bell, and promises Olivia that if she stops Jones, Nina will arrange a meeting between her and Bell.|$|E

Instead, Rusk gains control of Lisa's body and demands to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is. His description of the murderer leads them another naval officer, who tells them Rusk's physically abused wife Teresa (Annie Parisse) hired him for the murder. Believing that he has left her mind, they learn too late that Rusk is still in control of Lisa; he goes to exact revenge on Teresa, but is stopped by Peter before he can go through with the murder. Lisa is eventually able to purge Rusk from her consciousness. The final scene shows an unrelated car crash victim suddenly waking up, mumbling in Russian: [...] "My Star", the pet name Rusk called his wife, meaning that Rusk is back.|$|E

500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush {{out of the station}} hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, it is {{time for}} the {{ceremony}} for the [...] "Worker of the Week" [...] award and Homer, the only employee who has never won the award, is confident he will win. However, Mr. Burns gives the award to an [...] "inanimate carbon rod". The dejected Homer, feeling that no one respects him, turns to TV for solace and comes across a live space shuttle launch, which he finds dull. Meanwhile, NASA, frustrated over its drop in the Nielsen ratings, decides to send an [...] "average shmoe" [...] into space as the solution. At that moment, Homer telephones NASA to complain about their [...] "boring space launches", as well as asking if they <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> can find some Tang, and NASA chiefs realize they have found their man. When they arrive at Moe's Tavern in search of Homer, who is currently calling Bill Clinton to ask about Tang, he believes he is in trouble for making a prank call to NASA and blames Barney for the incident. The NASA employees ask Barney to be an astronaut, and when Homer realizes what the proposal entails, he steps in and takes credit for the call.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|E
