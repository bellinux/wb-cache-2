40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) isolator designed by combining a <b>disk</b> <b>spring</b> with a vertical linear spring. The static {{characteristics of the}} <b>disk</b> <b>spring</b> and the QZS isolator are investigated. The optimal combination of the configurative parameters is derived to achieve a wide displacement range around the equilibrium position in which the stiffness has a low value and changes slightly. By considering the overloaded or underloaded conditions, the dynamic equations are established for both force and displacement excitations. The frequency response curves (FRCs) are obtained by using the harmonic balance method (HBM) and confirmed by the numerical simulation. The stability of the steady-state solution is analyzed by applying Floquet theory. The force, absolute displacement, and acceleration transmissibility are defined to evaluate the isolation performance. Effects of the offset displacement, excitation amplitude, and damping ratio on the QZS isolator and the equivalent system (ELS) are studied. The results demonstrate that the QZS isolator for overloaded or underloaded can exhibit different stiffness characteristics with changing excitation amplitude. If loaded with an appropriate mass, excited by not too large amplitude, and owned a larger damper, the QZS isolator can possess better isolation performance than its ELS in low frequency range...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to derive the exact {{analytical}} expressions for torsion and bending creep of rods with the Norton-Bailey, Garofalo and Naumenko-Altenbach-Gorash constitutive models. These simple constitutive models, for example, the time- and strain-hardening constitutive equations, were based on adaptations for time-varying stress of equally simple models for the secondary creep stage from constant load/stress uniaxial tests where minimum creep rate is constant. The analytical solution is studied for Norton-Bailey and Garofalo laws in uniaxial states of stress. The most common secondary creep constitutive model has been the Norton-Bailey Law which gives a power law relationship between minimum creep rate and (constant) stress. The distinctive mathematical properties of the power law allowed the development of analytical methods, many {{of which can be}} found in high temperature design codes.

The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure.

The article discusses results of static loading test of the expansion shell rock bolts equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The <b>disk</b> <b>spring</b> and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed.

The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the expansion shell rock bolt with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (washer, thread) and the expansion shell head displacements, were estimated.

40|$|A Belleville washer can be best {{described}} as a non flat washer with a conical shape and a uniform cross section. They are also known as <b>disk</b> <b>springs</b> and as the name suggests they are often utilised for their load bearing capabilities. Due to their compactness along the axis of loading and {{a wide range of}} attainable load-deflection characteristics they are an attractive alternative to conventional springs. Though Belleville washers are primarily used for their load bearing capabilities, they {{can also be used to}} build a damping device; which in turn can be used as part of a suspension system. The non linear deflection of the spring makes it difficult to predict the resulting pressure-flow characteristic and as a result the damper pack is built either by an experienced operative or by a trial and improvement method. Without an analytical tool to predict the behaviour a designer cannot exploit the full functionality of this type of spring. The intension of this paper is to present research undertaken to develop a correlation which describes the pressure drop required for various flow rates when using Belleville washers as damping elements. Using existing load deflection theory an initial model was developed to relate load with pressure and deflection with flow area which could be used to estimate flow rate. The solutions from a computer simulation showed similar trends to those found in the experimental study, but they estimated smaller pressure drops for a given flow rate. It was postulated that the exit velocity of the fluid created a region of low pressure which tended to close the opening and thus increase the pressure drop. This hypothesis was examined and confirmed with a computational fluid dynamic simulation and the results were used to modify the existing model. Analysis of the new model showed good agreement with the experimental study...|$|R

The disk rotates at a constant angular velocity and is acted upon by a load consisting of a mass distributed over a finite area of the <b>disk,</b> a <b>spring,</b> and a dashpot. Using a finite mode approximation, the equation of motion of the transverse deflection of the disk is written as a system of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Analysis of the eigenvalues of the finite mode approximation yields four distinct types of instability. An instability occurs due to the stiffness of the load, terminal instabilities occur due to both {{the mass of the}} load and the damping of the load, and an instability occurs as a result of modal coupling. The multiple mode approximation used in the spinning disk analysis is applied to a stationary disk with a moving load. Comparison of the spinning and stationary disk shows the influence of the centrifugal stress of the rotating disk. The direct stability methods of Liapunov are applied to the equation of motion for both the spinning and stationary disk and are used to prove the stability of the systems at speeds below certain critical speeds. Upper bounds for the difference between eigenvalues of the finite mode approximation and eigenvalues of a full infinite mode system are derived. These bounds are calculated for the eigenvalues of a modal coupling instability arising from the finite mode analysis to show that the solution of the full set of equations is also unstable...|$|R

Moreover, the content of 0 -dihydroxyphenols in the soil was compared in the last year of the study. The soil used to prepare the solutions came from a field experiment established on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil. Spring wheat, cv.

Germination energy and capacity of spring wheat in the control treatment watered with distilled water were significantly higher compared to the other treatments under evaluation. Spring wheat watered with the aqueous extract prepared from the soil obtained from the plough tillage treatment produced a significantly longer first leaf compared to the treatments in which both conservation tillage methods had been used.
