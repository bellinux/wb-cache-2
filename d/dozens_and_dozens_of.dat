40|$|This {{article is}} a brief {{description}} of a theatrical production that entitles Teater Tedung Agung, which was collaboratively produced by the Indonesian State Collage of Arts, Denpasar and an art director, Ms. Barbara Txi Hannah, visiting artist from Canada. About three <b>dozen</b> students <b>and</b> a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> faculty members of the college were involved to perform the production on the last March 29 th, 2003. Enacting a philosophical theme of Dewaruci, this theatre integrated the traditional Wayang sahdow puppet show, contemporary arrangement of dance movements and choreography, and the realistic acting style. The well-known Mahabharata dramatic character, Bima, served as the protagonist character while the Korawa served as the antagonistic character. By transforming the ancient theme of Dewaruci into a child fiction, the production was hoped to instigate public awareness that physical developments in Bali are owned by foreigners, not Balinese...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Correct {{resolution}} of ambiguities for GNSS reference network is prerequisite for generation of corrections for network RTK. Due {{to the presence}} of atmospheric delay in the double-differenced observations, the convergence time of ambiguity is about a <b>dozen</b> minutes <b>and</b> even <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> minutes for medium <b>and</b> long baselines. And in the case of loss-of-lock or new rising satellites, the integer ambiguities have to be redetermined over and over again. But for the application of GNSS network RTK, the {{resolution of}} ambiguity needs to be determined real time as possible. Atmospheric delays of previous epochs are used to predict atmospheric delays of following epochs, and then wide and narrow lane combination of carrier-phase observations as well as ionosphere-free combination is used to resolve ambiguities with single epoch. Our test results show that the precision of predicted double-differenced tropospheric and ionospheric delays is about 2 - 3 cm using temporal-and spatial-correlation exponent model, and the success rates of L 1 ambiguities resolution with single epoch reach above 90 % for medium and long distance GNSS reference station network...|$|R

For one moment we saw a head and body in the air, absolutely deprived of the lower limbs. The moment after, the terrible creature touched the floor as lightly as a monkey, on his hands. The grotesque horror of the scene culminated in his hopping away on his hands, at a prodigious speed, until he reached the fire-place in the long room.

60|$|All sorts and {{conditions}} of frogs lived in that little bay. There was one inquisitive fellow, who always {{came out of the}} pads and swam as near as he could get whenever I appeared on the shore. Another would sit in his favorite spot, under a stranded log, and let me come as close as I would; but the moment I dangled the red ibis fly in front of him, he would disappear like a wink, and not show himself again. Another would follow the fly in a wild kangaroo dance over the lily pads, going round and round the canoe as if bewitched, and would do his best to climb in after the bit of color when I pulled it up slowly over the bark. He afforded me so much good fun that I could not eat him; though I always stopped to give him another dance, whenever I went fishing for other frogs just like him. Further along shore lived another, a perfect savage, so wild that I could never catch him, which strangled or drowned two big frogs in a week, to my certain knowledge. And then, one night when I was trying to find my canoe which I had lost in the darkness, I came upon a frog migration, <b>dozens</b> <b>and</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> them, all hopping briskly in the same direction. They had left the stream, driven by some strange instinct, just like rats or squirrels, and were going through the woods to the unknown destination that beckoned them so strongly that they could not but follow.|$|E
5000|$|To {{acknowledge}} its chapters {{outside of}} the United States, the Board of Trustees took action in 1980 to {{change the name of}} the Society to [...] "Pi Gamma Mu, International Honor Society in Social Sciences". In 1982, the name of its official journal was also changed to International Social Science Review. In 1991 to enhance its international scope, the trustees approved the conferring of affiliate (or associate member) status on visiting fellows and exchange students who demonstrate academic excellence in their fields but are not otherwise expected to complete their degree programs at a Pi Gamma Mu sheltering college or university. The same international emphasis continued as the Philippines Alpha chapter commemorated its 75th Anniversary on March 7, 2007. The unique influence of the Philippines Alpha chapter is recorded in Scott Johnston’s work, Pi Gamma Mu International Honor Society in Social Science First 75 Years: “Again the quality of the people elected to the Philippines Alpha chapter has been most impressive.

5000|$|Painting and {{literature}} are comparatively inexpensive arts which individuals {{such as the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries Realist writers and Impressionist painters could afford to experiment with, whether their works were accepted or not, but theatre requires a space and collaborators, and is a public art subject to the scrutiny of church, state, and the press. At the Caffe Cino, which made its meager living not from public approval of the work it presented, but from selling food and drink, where no one was paid except the police who were paid off, where reviewers seldom came (and reviews were usually published after a show had closed), theatre effectively entered the Modern era which the other arts had entered a hundred years before. <b>Dozens</b> <b>and</b> then more <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> theatres appeared, based on the Cino model, in places which made their living other ways—cafes, bars, art galleries, and churches. To distinguish it from Broadway (large Equity theatres) and Off-Broadway (smaller Equity theatres), this new outside/underground theatre world {{came to be known}} as [...] "Off-Off-Broadway." [...] For the first time in history, the stage could be an area of primary expression, rebellion, novelty, and a vehicle for social and aesthetic change—in a word, unpopular. As a novelist has described it: [...] "Off-Off-Broadway: The first place in human history where theatre is treated as the equal of the other arts, as a thing responsible and important above popularity ratings, outside monetary concerns, beyond academic and legal restrictions: The first studio of theater where playwrights can experiment as painters and poets have done for a century, free from the tyranny of audience, box-office, church, and criticism." [...] Caffe Cino’s first theatrical offerings were plays from established playwrights such as Tennessee Williams and Jean Giraudoux. The first original play Cino produced is thought to be James Howard’s Flyspray (summer of 1960). Cino became so excited by the audience’s and his own response to the plays that he quickly established a weekly schedule for theatrical performances. He would introduce the acts with the phrase, [...] "It's magic time!" ...|$|R
