5|$|London {{has been}} the setting for many works of literature. The {{literary}} centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers {{closely associated with the}} city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his <b>eyewitness</b> <b>account</b> of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, {{regarded as one of the}} foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} <b>eyewitness</b> <b>account</b> of {{the event}} consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus. Pliny the Younger describes, amongst other things, the last days {{in the life of}} his uncle, Pliny the Elder. Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately , the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences. In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.|$|E

5|$|To provide authenticity, Luttrell {{moved into}} Berg's home {{for one month}} while Berg was writing the script. Luttrell acted as a consultant, {{detailing}} to Berg his <b>eyewitness</b> <b>account</b> {{of the events that}} unfolded during Operation Red Wings. Berg later embedded with a Navy SEAL team—becoming the first civilian to do so—and lived with them for a month in Iraq while he continued writing the screenplay. In re-enacting the injuries and deaths of the fallen Navy SEAL servicemen, Berg relied on Luttrell's eyewitness accounts from the book, as well as autopsy reports of the deceased and after-action reports. The United States Navy provided incident reports related to the mission, as well as archival military training footage, which is shown during the film's opening credits sequence.

Schoenberg's war photography book The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday: Making Navy SEALs. During filming, there were some dialogue changes in comparison to Berg's script, as the filmmaker occasionally encouraged the actors to improvise their lines.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their first}} landing in Sicily {{in the late}} 820s, the Aghlabids had tried several times, without success, to capture Syracuse. They were able to {{gradually}} take over the western half of the island, however, and in 875, a new and energetic governor, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, was appointed, determined to capture the city. Ja'far began the siege in August 877, but soon left it in charge of his son Abu Ishaq, while he retired to Palermo. The Arabs were well supplied with siege weapons, while the inhabitants of Syracuse were left largely unsupported by the Byzantine fleet, which was busy with transporting marble for a new church in Constantinople, and was then delayed by adverse weather. Consequently, the besieged populace faced great hardships and famine, described in detail by the <b>eyewitness</b> <b>account</b> of Theodosios the Monk. Finally, the Aghlabids managed to effect a breach in the seaward walls, and on 21 May 878 managed to break through it into the city. The defenders {{and much of the}} populace were massacred, while others, including Theodosios, were taken prisoner. The Byzantine patrikios who commanded the defence surrendered with a few of his men, but they were executed after a week, while a handful of soldiers escaped and brought the news east to the fleet that had belatedly set sail to aid the city. The Muslims were unable to capitalize upon this success due to internal rivalries, which even led to a full-scale civil war. Small-scale warfare with the Byzantines continued without any side gaining a decisive advantage until the arrival of the deposed Aghlabid emir Ibrahim II, who in 902 rallied the Sicilian Muslims and captured Taormina, effectively completing the Muslim conquest of Sicily, although a few fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965.|$|E
