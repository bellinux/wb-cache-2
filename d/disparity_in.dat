40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> access to health care among children has focused on measuring absolute and relative differences experienced by race/ethnic groups and, to a lesser extent, socioeconomic groups. However, it is not clear from existing literature how <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> access to care may have changed over time for children, especially following implementation of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The primary objective of this research was to determine if there has been a decrease <b>in</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> access to care for children across two socioeconomic groups and race/ethnicity groups after SCHIP implementation. Methods commonly used to measure ‘health inequalities’ were used to measure <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> access to care including population-attributable risk (PAR) and the relative index of inequality (RII). Using these measures there is evidence of a substantial decrease <b>in</b> socioeconomic <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health insurance coverage {{and to a lesser extent}} in having a usual source of care since the SCHIP program began. There is also evidence of a considerable decrease <b>in</b> non-Hispanic Black <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> access to care.

Data from 946 African American and 535 Caucasian patients receiving HIV care at the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinic be-tween January 1, 1999, and August 1, 2012, were used to estimate the association between African American race and HIV virological suppression (i. e., undetectable HIV- 1 RNA) when racial <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> clinic attendance were lessened. Clinic attendance was measured as the proportion of scheduled clinic appointments attended (i. e., visit adherence) or the proportion of six 4 -month intervals with at least 1 attended scheduled clinic appointment (i. e., visit constancy). In analyses accounting for patient characteristics, the risk ratio for achieving suppression when comparing African Americans with Caucasians was 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 85, 0. 98). Lessening <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> adherence or constancy lowered <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> virological suppression by up to 44. 4 % and 11. 1 %, respectively.

Our aim was to examine socioeconomic and racial <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> subclinical CVD indices among adolescents. We hypothesized that African American and lower SES adolescents would show greater arterial stiffness and intima media thickness compared to Caucasian and higher SES adolescents, respectively. Participants were 81 African American and 78 Caucasian adolescents (mean ageÂ =Â  17. 8) from two schools in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Measures of subclinical CVD were pulse wave velocity and intima media thickness, as assessed by Doppler and B-mode ultrasound, respectively. SES indices included parental education, family income, family assets, subjective social status, and census-derived neighborhood SES. Hypotheses were evaluated in multiple linear regression models with the covariates age, gender, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Results indicated that African American adolescents were more often in low SES positions than Caucasians. When considered individually, racial and SES <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> pulse wave velocity, and to a lesser extent, intima media thickness, were evident. When race and SES were considered together, high school education, low or medium income, and low neighborhood SES were associated with higher pulse wave velocity.

In conclusion, racial and SES <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> indices of subclinical CVD were observed, with findings most pronounced for SES <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> pulse wave velocity.

Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} contemporary {{evidence on}} patterns of health <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> Canada and suggests theoretical mechanisms that {{give rise to}} these patterns. The overall health of Canadians, as measured by life expectancy or mortality, has improved dramatically over the past 30 years and some disparities have diminished slightly (e. g., life expectancy by income group for men), while others have increased (e. g., diabetes for Aboriginal peoples). Arguably the most egregious health <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> Canada are those existing between Aboriginals {{and the rest of the}} Canadian population. This paper focuses specifically on three social determinants and their effects on <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health; Aboriginal status, income, and place. Overall we take the approach that <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health could be alleviated by reducing inequities in the distribution of these determinants. We further argue that these social determinants are proxies for opportunities, resources and constraints; all of which influence health outcomes. We suggest that policies focus on reducing the social inequities that lead to health <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> Canada, rather than focusing on the <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health alone. Since the social determinants described here have been found to influence an array of disease outcomes, tackling them, rather than their outcomes, may have a greater overall influence on the health of the population...|$|R
