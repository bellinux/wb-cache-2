Each VM is driven {{by one of the}} individual traces (ClarkNet, EPA, and SDSC [25]), and two different job types from the Google Cluster Data trace [26]. For each workload pattern, <b>incing</b> requests are calculated with 100  s interval. The requests rate is used to define current workload of each VM. The CPU requirement of each VM is calculated through a linear function of current input rate. Each VM starts its trace with a random selected offset time.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{with several}} bottom fish species from urban {{waterways}} show {{that of the}} identified xenobiotic chemicals in bottom sediments, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the most strongly associated with the prevalence of liver lesions, includ neoplasms. Accordingly, there is concern about the transfer of contaminants, such as PAHs, from aquatic s s to hum Because PAlHseert theirtaidty only after being lorm ed, <b>incing</b> attention {{has been focused on}} the ability of aquatic organiss to metabolize these chemicals. Overall, the reslts of both laboratory and field studies show that generafly low levels (nanograms per gram wet weight) of a few low molecular weight PAHs may be present in edible tissue offish from areas and that high nmoeuar weiglt PAHs, such as the carcnogen benzo(a) pyrene, wil rrely be debtcted because ofexensivenueAbolin. Addiionally, the rets from a few studies suggest that even though interactions between xenobiotics can affect both biochemical and physiological systems to alter the disposition of PAHs in fish, these interctons do not markdly change the relative proportions of metabolites to parent PAH in tissues. Thus, these studies clearly demonstrate that to obtain some insight into the questonsofwheter there is any risk to human health from consuming fish and crustaeans from urban areas, techniques must be developed that measure metabolites of carcinogens, such as PAHs, in edible tissue. Initial attempts may focuson semiquantitative mthodsthat permit rapid assessment of the levd of metabolites in edible tissues of fish and crustaceans from many urban areas. Based on information from such screening studies, further refinement in methodology leading to identification of specific compounds may be needed becausecertain metaboltes may not be as toc or carcngenik as othem A scientifiall sound database on a broad spectrum ofcontaminants and their metabolites in aquatic species is needed before we can adequately address the question of bioavailability or food chain transfer of these compounds to humans...|$|E
