40|$|The {{diagnostics}} {{and monitoring}} of the running condition of a car engine is very important and smart way to enhance the efficiency and maintenance of the engine. In the modern era almost all modern vehicles include an On Board Diagnostic (OBD) system. The OBD system can always monitor the running condition of engine. When the OBD system detects a malfunction in any of sensors or engine parameters, OBD regulations require the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle to save a standardized <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Code</b> (DTC) about the information of malfunction in the memory. These DTC’s can be processed and read by connecting external scanner to OBD system which then shows the diagnostic results. But this project removes the need of external scanner. The {{purpose of this study}} is to make the information of different sensors of engine and parameters of vehicle freely available to drivers or mechanics on an embedded screen device. This system eliminates the need of any external scanner required to show the diagnostic results of OBD system and solves these problems by providing many useful functions such as real time display of sensor data, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>code</b> (DTC) reading and displaying information of different sensors and parameters of engine in a simple and an easily understandable language for the user (driver) ...|$|E

40|$|Most modern road {{vehicles}} today utilise the CAN bus for internal communication between sensors, instruments and control units. It is a bus that is cheap, reliable, durable against electrical disturbances and {{well suited for}} the vehicle industry. While {{the acceptance of the}} CAN bus has grown over the years, so has the need to standardise services possible to perform using this network. A document called ISO 14229 - 1 has been put together that will cover these issues, and can hopefully be accepted as a world standard of services in a near future. ISO 14229 - 1 covers everything from testing the exhaust levels of the fumes, to reading sensor values or downloading new software. The set of services that can be performed is referred to as Diagnostics. If an error occurs, for instance a sensor reports erroneous values, this is logged as a <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Code</b> in the control unit. It is now possible when fixing the vehicle to extract and interpret the trouble code, which yields the problem, and by this replace the faulty sensor. When accessing the CAN bus a cable has to be connected to the vehicle. The cable limits freedom of movement, which can cause a lot of annoyance. An example would be when a mechanic performs tests with his scan tool. Say that he wants to check that all the lights on a truck are operable. He or she needs a really long cable to reach around the trailer. A wireless link would be a far better alternative. The Bluetooth technology could be used as link between the tool and the vehicles CAN bus. This thesis investigates and implements a solution on how to perform diagnostic services using Bluetooth as a gateway between the diagnostic terminal and the CAN bus of a road vehicle. The implementation covers a set of services according to ISO 14229 - 1, including the download function. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Codes</b> are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network.

40|$|As {{testing of}} car {{electronics}} now-a-days requires {{a vast amount}} of time and can be very costly, car manufacturers have developed a common technology – the virtual platform. Virtual platforms are fast, executable simulations of the hardware and the environment it evolves in.

So the advantage with the virtual platform is to allow a full software load to be run with accuracy enough to produce the true timing and the true network traffic that the real electronics will experience without having to compromise the real electronics.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of electronic control units (ECUs) are nowadays networked in automotive vehicles to help achieve advanced vehicle control and eliminate bulky electrical wiring. This, however, inevitably leads to increased complexity in vehicle fault diagnostics. Traditional off-board fault diagnostics and repair at service centres, by using only <b>diagnostic</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>codes</b> logged by conventional onboard diagnostics, can become unwieldy especially when dealing with intermittent faults in complex networked electronic systems. This can result in inaccurate and time consuming diagnostics {{due to lack of}} real-time fault information of the interaction among ECUs in the network-wide perspective. This thesis proposes a new framework for on-board knowledge-based diagnostics focusing on network level faults, and presents an implementation of a real-time in-vehicle network diagnostic system, using case-based reasoning. A newly developed fault detection technique and the results from several practical experiments with the diagnostic system using a network simulation tool, a hardware- in-the- loop simulator, a disturbance simulator, simulated ECUs and real ECUs networked on a test rig are also presented. The results show that the new vehicle diagnostics scheme, based on the proposed new framework, can provide more real-time network level diagnostic data, and more detailed and self-explanatory diagnostic outcomes. This new system can provide increased diagnostic capability when compared with conventional diagnostic methods in terms of detecting message communication faults. In particular, the underlying incipient network problems that are ignored by the conventional on-board diagnostics are picked up for thorough fault diagnostics and prognostics which can be carried out by a whole-vehicle fault management system, contributing to the further development of intelligent and fault-tolerant vehicles...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case study of anomaly {{detection}} using com-mercial vehicle data (from a single vehicle collected over a six-month interval) and propose a failure-event analysis. Our analysis allows performance comparison of anomaly detec-tion models in the absence of sufficient anomalies to compute the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Several heuristically-guided data-driven models were consid-ered to capture the relationship among three main engine sig-nals (oil pressure, temperature, and speed). These models include regression-based approaches and distance-based ap-proaches; the former use the residual’s z-score as the detec-tion metric, while the latter use a Mahalanobis distance or similar measure as the metric. The selected regression-based models (Boosted Regression Trees, Feed-Forward Neural Net-works, and Gridded Regression tables) outperformed the se-lected distance-based approaches (Gaussian Mixtures and Repli-cator Neural Networks). Both groups of models were supe-rior to existing <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Codes.</b> The Gridded Re-gression tables and Boosted Regression Trees exhibited the best overall metric performance. We report a surprising behavior of one of the models: locally-optimal Gaussian Mixture Models often had zero detection performance, with such models occurring in at least 25 % of the iterations with seven or more Gaussians in the mixture. To overcome the problem, we propose a regularization method that employs a heuristic filter for rejecting Gaussian Mixtures with non-discriminative components. Howard Bussey et al.
