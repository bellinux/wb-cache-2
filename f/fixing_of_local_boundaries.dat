40|$|In {{this paper}} two main topics are addressed.

Secondly, the expressive timing deviations found in a number of expert piano performances are examineded in relation to the <b>local</b> <b>boundaries</b> discovered by LBDM. As a result of a set of preliminary experiments, it is suggested that the assumption of final-note lengthening of a melodic gesture is not always valid and that, in some cases, the end of a melodic group is marked by lengthening the second-to-last note (or, seeing it from a different viewpoint, by delaying the last note). ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{theoretical}} perfectly absorbing boundary condition on {{the boundary of}} a half–space domain is developed for the Maxwell system by considering {{the system as a}} whole instead of considering each component of the electromagnetic fields individually. This boundary condition allows any wave motion generated within the domain to pass through the boundary of the domain without generating any reflections back into the interior. By approximating this theoretical boundary condition a class <b>of</b> <b>local</b> absorbing <b>boundary</b> conditions for the Maxwell system can be constructed. Well–posedness in the sense of Kreiss of the Maxwell system with each <b>of</b> these <b>local</b> absorbing <b>boundary</b> conditions is established, and the reflection coefficients are computed as a plane wave strikes the artificial boundary.
