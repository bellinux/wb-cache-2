5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Washington {{was located}} at the highest point of the island of Manhattan, along a large {{outcropping}} of Manhattan schist near its northernmost tip. Along with Fort Lee, located just across the Hudson River atop the New Jersey Palisades, the twin forts were <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the lower Hudson from British warships.|$|E
5|$|Having {{established}} {{control of}} the islands, between 1651 and 1652 Blake constructed Cromwell's Castle on Tresco, named after Oliver Cromwell, the Parliamentary leader. It was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the deep water entrance to New Grimsby harbour {{on the west side}} of the island, a route which could also allow enemy vessels access through to the other Scilly Isles. The Parliamentarian forces were particularly concerned about any potential Dutch attack.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the Bellevue {{city council}} {{considered}} protecting the city hall's view of Mount Rainier, {{which would have}} been blocked under a proposed high-rise zoning plan for the East Main light rail station. The proposal, requested by city staffers, was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the view from public areas of the building, according to city spokespeople. The city council decided against a formal protection of the view, favoring increased development near transit.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} years, more towers were {{built around the}} islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> or restore the mother's health {{if she would}} be in mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} ectopic pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|Since 1924, {{the castle}} has been {{designated}} as a Scheduled Ancient Monument which is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> important archaeological sites from change. During the Second World War Starfish sites were built as decoys for bombing raids. Nine were built around Manchester, including one close to Buckton Castle. At this time a brick hut was built over part of the castle ditch. The Starfish site went out of use in 1943.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|Along the shoreline, blizzards {{shut down}} traffic and communication, causing {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars in damage. A 22-inch (56cm) snowfall in Cleveland, Ohio, put stores out of business for two days. There were four-foot (122cm) snowdrifts around Lake Huron. Power was out for several days across Michigan and Ontario, cutting off telephone and telegraph communications. A recently completed US$100,000 Chicago breakwater, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Lincoln Park basin from storms, was swept away in a few hours. The Milwaukee harbor lost its entire south breakwater and much of the surrounding South Park area that had been recently renovated.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E

50|$|A {{bilateral}} NDA (Sometimes {{referred to}} as a mutual NDA or a two-way NDA) Involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger.|$|R
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
50|$|The {{animals on}} {{the four corners of}} the {{pavilion}} are mascots of luck and <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> people in the house against evil spirits. Technically, however, the little animals are used to cover the nail holes that secure the half-cylinder shaped tiles to the eaves. This prevents the wood structure from rotting.|$|R

5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, {{and a great deal of}} work had been done to reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and {{to make the}} river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Hitler {{approved}} {{the creation of}} an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> ethnic Albania but remain under German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving in the Balkans, the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). Himmler's goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.|$|E
50|$|The militia had {{its roots}} in the 1980s when militias were {{established}} by drug lords to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion. In April 1997 the AUC was formed through a merger, orchestrated by the ACCU, of local right-wing militias, each <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> different local economic, social and political interests by fighting left-wing insurgents in their areas.|$|R

5|$|St Briavels Castle was {{constructed}} sometime between 1075 and 1129 by royal mandate, although the precise date is uncertain. Walter de Gloucester, the Sheriff of Gloucester {{and his son}} Miles de Gloucester made St Briavels Castle the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean. The location of the castle placed it well behind the English border, in an area with little Welsh presence before the invasion, and it therefore {{appears to have been}} established for the purposes of royal governance, rather than to protect the Welsh Marches to its west. Equivalents elsewhere in the south-west include Restormel Castle and Lydford Castle in Devon and Cornwall, both regional royal administrative centres. One alternative view, however, sees St Briavels as <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Severn estuary to the south, along with the royal castles of Bristol and Gloucester. This early castle was of motte and bailey design, the keep probably of wood.|$|E
5|$|The British mustered an {{overwhelming}} force under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, who collected 29 ships and 10,000 men – almost {{four times the}} number of French regular forces garrisoning Martinique. Landing in force on both the southern and northern coasts of the island, British troops pushed inland, defeating French regulars in the central highlands and routing local militia units in the south of the island. By 9 February, the entire island was in British hands except Fort Desaix, a powerful position <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the capital Fort-de-France, which had been bypassed during the British advance. In a siege lasting 15 days the Fort was constantly bombarded, the French suffering 200 casualties before finally surrendering.|$|E
5|$|The first dreadnoughts {{tended to}} have a very light {{secondary}} armament <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> them from torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, {{there was no need to}} armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.|$|E
