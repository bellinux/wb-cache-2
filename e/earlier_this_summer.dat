6000|$|The ecclesiastical {{history of}} this town {{interested}} us somewhat. It appears that [...] "they very early built a small meeting-house, twenty feet square, with a thatched roof through which they might fire their muskets,"--of course, at the Devil. [...] "In 1662, the town agreed that a part of every whale cast on shore be appropriated {{for the support of}} the ministry." [...] No doubt there seemed to be some propriety in thus leaving the support of the ministers to Providence, whose servants they are, and who alone rules the storms; for, when few whales were cast up, they might suspect that their worship was not acceptable. The ministers must have sat upon the cliffs in every storm, and watched the shore with anxiety. And, for my part, if I were a minister I would rather trust to the bowels of the billows, on the back-side of Cape Cod, to cast up a whale for me, than to the generosity of many a country parish that I know. You cannot say of a country minister's salary, commonly, that it is [...] "very like a whale." [...] Nevertheless, the minister who depended on whales cast up must have had a trying time of it. I would rather have gone to the Falkland Isles with a harpoon, and done with it. Think of a w hale having the breath of life beaten out of him by a storm, and dragging in over the bars and guzzles, for the support of the ministry! What a consolation it must have been to him! I have heard of a minister, who had been a fisherman, being settled in Bridgewater for as long a time as he could tell a cod from a haddock. Generous as it seems, this condition would empty most country pulpits forthwith, for it is long since the fishers of men were fishermen. Also, a duty was put on mackerel here to support a free-school; in other words, the mackerel-school was taxed in order that the children's school might be free. [...] "In 1665 the Court passed a law to inflict corporal punishment on all persons, who resided in the towns of this government, who denied the Scriptures." [...] Think of a man being whipped on a spring morning till he was constrained to confess that the Scriptures were true! [...] "It was also voted by the town that all persons who should stand out of the meeting-house during the time of divine service should be set in the stocks." [...] It behooved such a town to see that sitting in the meeting-house was nothing akin to sitting in the stocks, lest the penalty of obedience to the law might be greater than that of disobedience. This was the Eastham famous of late years for its camp-meetings, held in a grove near by, to which thousands flock {{from all parts of the}} Bay. We conjectured that the reason for the perhaps unusual, if not unhealthful, development of the religious sentiment here was the fact that a large portion of the population are women whose husbands and sons are either abroad on the sea, or else drowned, and there is nobody but they and the ministers left behind. The old account says that [...] "hysteric fits are very common in Orleans, Eastham, and the towns below, particularly on Sunday, in the times of divine service. When one woman is affected, five or six others generally sympathize with her; and the congregation is thrown into the utmost confusion. Several old men suppose, unphilosophically and uncharitably, perhaps, that the will is partly concerned, and that ridicule and threats would have a tendency to prevent the evil." [...] How this is now we did not learn. We saw one singularly masculine woman, however, in a house on this very plain, who did not look as if she was ever troubled with hysterics, or sympathized with those that were; or, perchance, life itself was to her a hysteric fit,--a Nauset woman, of a hardness and coarseness such as no man ever possesses or suggests. It was enough to see the vertebrae and sinews of her neck, and her set jaws of iron, which would have bitten a board-nail in two in their ordinary action,--braced against the world, talking like a man-of-war's-man in petticoats, or as if shouting to you through a breaker; who looked as if it made her head ache to live; hard enough for any enormity. I looked upon her as one who had committed infanticide; who never had a brother, unless it were some wee thins: that died in infancy,--for what need of him?--and whose father must have died before she was born. This woman told us that the camp-meetings were not held the previous summer for fear of introducing the cholera, and that they would have been held <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>summer,</b> but the rye was so backward that straw would not have been re adv for them; for they He in straw. There are sometimes one hundred and fifty ministers (!) and five thousand hearers assembled. The ground, which is called Millennium Grove, is owned by a company in Boston, and is the most suitable, or rather unsuitable, for this purpose of any that I saw on the Cape. It is fenced, and the frames of the tents are at all times to be seen interspersed among the oaks. They have an oven and a pump, and keep all their kitchen utensils and tent coverings and furniture in a permanent building on the spot. They select a time for their meetings when the moon is full. A man is appointed to clear out the pump a week beforehand, while the ministers are clearing their throats; but, probably, the latter do not always deliver as pure a stream as the former. I saw the heaps of clam-shells left under the tables, where they had feasted in previous summers, and supposed, of course, that that was the work of the unconverted, or the backsliders and scoffers. It looked as if a camp-meeting must be a singular combination of a prayer-meeting and a picnic.|$|E

40|$|As a {{reaction}} to the Supreme Court’s historic marriage equality decision <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>summer,</b> many Southern state legislators opposing the trend toward LGBT-protective laws have proposed legislation that would essentially prohibit municipalities from carving out new antidiscrimination protections for the LGBT community. Conservative Senator Bart Hester spearheaded the passing of one of these “anti” antidiscrimination laws in Arkansas, and states like Texas, West Virginia, Michigan, and Oklahoma are not far behind. These “Hester-type laws” are strikingly similar to the Colorado amendment struck down by the Romer v. Evans Court 20 years ago. Both the Colorado amendment and the new wave of Hester-type laws implicate the precise concerns that the Court’s limited application of the political process doctrine was designed to protect. They restructure the political process in a way that obstructs the LGBT community—and only that community—from achieving beneficial legislation at a local level. Since equal access to the political process is a right guaranteed by the Constitution, this article first submits that Hester-type laws would not pass constitutional muster under the political process doctrine. Despite the perfect doctrinal fit, however, it is questionable whether the political process doctrine survives post–Schuette v. BAMN. Alternatively, this article suggests a novel and groundbreaking argument for invalidating Hester-type laws under the Court’s Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. As recognized in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. U. S., private discrimination in public accommodations does affect interstate commerce. Assuming that LGBT-friendly businesses will flee states with Hester-type laws and migrate toward states with more robust protections for the LGBT community, this article submits that Hester-type laws create a problem of economic isolationism, which in the aggregate could negatively impact interstate commerce. It is not uncommon for a constitutional doctrine to undergo a metamorphosis. Just as the principles of due process transformed from economics to personal liberty to match the needs of the time, so too should the doctrine of the Dormant Commerce Clause evolve from protecting equality in interstate commerce to protecting equality in public accommodations for the LGBT community...|$|E
