The contributions from <b>heavy</b> and light <b>holes</b> are also extracted using this methodology, including minority carrier mobilities and lifetimes. <b>Heavy</b> <b>holes</b> are shown to initially dominate the transport {{due to their}} higher valence band density of states, but at large diffusion distances, the light holes begin to dominate due to their larger diffusion length. It is found that <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> have a diffusion length of 54. 5 +/- 0. 6 microns for an n-InGaAs doping of 8. 4 x 10 ^ 15 cm- 3 at room temperature, whereas light holes have a diffusion length in excess of 140 microns. <b>Heavy</b> <b>holes</b> demonstrate a mobility of 692 +/- 63 cm 2 /Vs and a lifetime of 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 microsec, whereas light holes demonstrate a mobility of 6200 +/- 960 cm- 2 /Vs and a slightly longer lifetime of 2. 6 +/- 1. 0 microsec.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the spin}} {{diffusion}} and drift at different wavelengths and different temperatures {{have been studied}} in undoped InGaAs/AlGaAs MQW. By using the AHE and ACPGE which are all derived from RSHE, we obtained the ratio between the spin diffusion coefficient and the mobility of spin-polarized carriers. From the wavelength dependence of the ratio, {{we found that the}} spin diffusion and drift of holes became as important as electrons in this undoped MQW, and the ratio for light holes was much smaller than that for <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> at room temperature. From the temperature dependence of the ratio corresponding to the 1 hh- 1 e transition, we believed the ratio is contributed by the combined effect of spin-polarized electrons and spin-polarized <b>heavy</b> <b>holes.</b> The correction factors for the common Einstein relationship for spin-polarized electrons and <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> are firstly obtained to be 93 and 286, respectively. It is worth noting that the AHE and ACPGE measurements used in this study are conducted under ambient conditions with a simple setup and operation, which provides a good method for the study of spin-related diffusion and drift.|$|R

The tunneling barrier for <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> is estimated to be lower than that for electrons, indicating the <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> might only tunnel to the defect states.

40|$|A novel spintronic {{nanodevice}} {{is proposed}} that is capable {{to manipulate the}} single <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin state in a coherent manner.

The <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin transformations are realized by transporting the hole around closed loops defined by metal gates deposited on top of the nanodevice. The device exploits Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction which translates the spatial motion of the hole into a rotation of the spin. The proposed quantum gate operates on sub nanosecond time scales and requires only the application of a weak static voltage which allows for addressing <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin qubit individually.

40|$|In this paper, several nanodevices which realize basic single <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> qubit {{operations}} are proposed {{and supported by}} time dependent self consistent Poisson-Schrödinger calculations using a four band heavy hole-light hole model. In particular we propose a set of nanodevices which can act as Pauli X, Y, Z quantum gates and as a gate that acts similar as a Hadamard gate (i. e. it creates a balanced superposition of basis states but with an additional phase factor) on the <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin qubit. We also present the design and simulation of a gated semiconductor nanodevice which can realize an arbitrary sequence of all these proposed single quantum logic gates. The proposed devices exploit the self-focusing effect of the hole wave function which allows for guiding the hole along a given path {{in the form of}} a stable soliton-like wave packet. Thanks to the presence of the Dresselhaus spin orbit coupling, the motion of the hole along a certain direction is equivalent to the application of an effective magnetic field which induces in turn a coherent rotation of the <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin. The hole motion and consequently the quantum logic operation is initialized only by weak static voltages applied to the electrodes which cover the nanodevice. The proposed gates allow for an all electric and ultrafast (tens of picoseconds) <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin manipulation and give the possibility to implement a scalable architecture of <b>heavy</b> <b>hole</b> spin qubits for quantum computation applications.

By letting grow valence-band mixing, it is shown the standard fixed-height rectangular potential-energy for the scatterer distribution, to be a reliable test-run input for <b>heavy</b> <b>holes.</b> On the contrary, this scheme is no longer valid for light holes and a mutable effective band offset profile has to be considered instead, whenever the in-plane kinetic energy changes.

40|$|Due {{to large}} {{difference}} in effective masses {{of light and}} <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> it is usually supposed that the above-barrier current in Schottky barriers on p-type semiconductor is controlled only by the <b>heavy</b> <b>holes.</b> However, in real structures, there is an additional potential barrier caused by a oxide layer at interface. For typical values of thickness and height of a barrier its tunnel transparency for light holes can be higher by three order of magnitude than that for <b>heavy</b> <b>holes.</b> Due to such separative role of insulator layer one can expect that the current is manly a contribution of light holes. To clear up this problem the investigation of transport in a magnetic field {{is used as a}} key experiment in this work. The pronounced magnetic field effect for <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> in investigated Pb-p-HgCdTe Schottky barriers is expected only at extremely strong magnetic fields B> 10 T within the framework of both diode and diffusion mechanism of transport. At the same time experimentally more than twofold decrease in saturation current is observed even at B= 0. 5 T at any orientation of magnetic field. The studies performed for HgCdTe with different Kane's gap and at different temperatures show that the magnitude of magnetic field effect is uniquely determined by the ratio of light hole cyclotron energy to a thermal energy. However the magnitude of effect exceeds considerably the prediction of the simple theory and the experimental magnetic field dependencies of a saturation current do not follow the simple exponential falling predicted for thermionic current. The reason of this discrepancy remains a mystery. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

30|$|On such basis, we can {{infer that}} {{carriers}} excited in QDs can thermally escape to WL and MB: there, electrons and <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> {{are separated by}} the band bending in the QD vicinity (Fig.  4 a), which promotes the hole trapping back to QDs and, while being a barrier for electrons, thereby effectively suppresses their radiative recombination. As a consequence, <b>heavy</b> <b>holes</b> are concentrated at the QD periphery (Fig.  4 c), whereas electrons are free to move along the potential well of WL and MB contributing to the conductivity.
