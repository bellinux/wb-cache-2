5|$|Late on July5, the Government of Jamaica {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} {{watch for the}} nation as Dennis intensified over the eastern Caribbean. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning early on July6. The warning remained in place for 48hours as the hurricane brushed the island, being discontinued on July8 as Dennis moved over northern Cuba and no longer posed a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a <b>direct</b> <b>threat,</b> a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is {{omnivorous}} and {{is capable of}} eating on land or in water. On an average day, a wood turtle will move , a decidedly long distance for a turtle. Many other animals that live in its habitat {{pose a threat to}} it. Raccoons are over-abundant in many places and are a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to all life stages of this species. Inadvertently, humans cause a large number of deaths through habitat destruction, road traffic, farming accidents, and illegal collection. When unharmed, it can live for up to 40 years in the wild and 58 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|By that time, the Byzantines had {{captured}} Arsamosata and additional strategically important {{locations in the}} mountains of southwest Armenia, posing a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the Muslim emirates around Lake Van. To reverse the situation, in 940Sayf al-Dawla initiated a remarkable campaign: starting from Mayyafiriqin (Byzantine Martyropolis), he crossed the Bitlis pass into Armenia, where he seized several fortresses and accepted the submission of the local lords, both Muslim and Christian. He ravaged the Byzantine holdings around Theodosiopolis and raided as far as Koloneia, which he besieged until Kourkouas arrived with a relief army and forced him to withdraw. Sayf al-Dawla was not able to follow up on this effort: until 945, the Hamdanids were preoccupied with internal developments in the Caliphate and with fighting against their rivals in southern Iraq and the Ikhshidids in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E

5|$|On August21, when Bret {{was first}} {{expected}} {{to approach the}} Texas coastline, the NHC issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and Baffin Bay, Texas. Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to Port Aransas. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through Port O'Connor and the advisories were extended to Freeport. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port O'Connor and Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August23, all watches and warnings {{in relation to the}} hurricane were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Six hours later, {{the watch}} was upgraded to a hurricane warning for Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in Montserrat mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase plywood, canned food, bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the islands. Three hours later, all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place. By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The main product made of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th century was the lead–acid battery, which posed no <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes acted as soldiers. In the early modern period they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Because the Highland Clans were not a <b>direct</b> <b>threat</b> to the Restoration government, or relations with England, the same effort was not put into suppressing their independence as had been focused on the Borders, until after the Glorious Revolution. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with Highland dress banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs and sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as indentured labour. All of this largely reducing clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within a generation.|$|E

25|$|In 632, Karasahr {{submitted}} to the Tang as a tributary state, as did the nearby kingdoms of Kashgar and Khotan. Tensions between Tang and Karasahr grew as the Chinese expanded further into Central Asia, and peaked when the Tang defeated and annexed Gaochang.

25|$|Agriculture {{throughout}} the reserve poses a more <b>direct</b> <b>threat.</b> As the populations expand within the reserve, so do their agricultural operations. Much of the wetland area is unsuitable for agriculture, needing levees and continued development to be productive.
