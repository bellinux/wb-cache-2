Although the concept of <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity equilibrium is widely used in the academic, public and business sector, the actual existence <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> equilibrium beween countries is widely debated. The continuous development of methods to analyse the properties of time series data has contributed to this debate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Power</b> Parity {{has most}} likely {{been one of}} the most {{investigated}} issues of the last decades within economic literature. The results from such studies are not consistent and not only important for policy makers and economists but also extremely important for policy implications in international finance. <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Power</b> Parity states the exchange rate between two countries should reflect the relative <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> of these two countries. This study tests the validity of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity hypothesis in Romania with employing Zivot–Andrews unit root test by taking structural break into account. We use annual data from 1991 to 2012 and the results show that <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity does not hold in Romania...|$|R

We distinguish between <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> and the investment power, and we build an indicator of total <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> of salaries. The study is developped by NACE activity sections and COICOP classification. We take into account the influence of the net job creation in each section on the average total salary. The article analyses which goods and services have become more expensive for the employees of each sector. We conclude that although the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> has remained constant on average, the total <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> has fallen sharply {{as a result of the}} increase in the average annual value of mortgages on homes. ...|$|R

40|$|Calculation of <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parities {{based on}} {{observed}} consumer behaviour typically {{relies on the}} existence of some kind of 'international preferences'. We argue that this unrealistic assumption can be abandoned in 'regional' studies of <b>purchasing</b> <b>power,</b> where prices in both territories under study might differ only slightly. Drawing on recent results for the derivation of equivalence scales, we develop a model of regional <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> and discuss several procedures for testing model specification.

In the present paper it is shown that the <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Power</b> Parity Theory in the relative sense holds even in a world without international trade in goods and that the propositions of that version of the <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Power</b> Parity Theory {{are not related to}} international trade in goods but are implications of the quantity theory of money. Although on occasion oral references to this result are made, formal and rigorous demonstrations of its validity seem not to be available.

40|$|<b>Purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity, nontraded {{prices and}} the terms of trade by Kathryn Matthews* This paper argues that the {{essential}} problem underlying the failure of empirical tests of <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity may be the loss of information that arises from aggregation of prices. A disaggregated specification of <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity is proposed and a measure of nontraded goods prices based on a broad theoretical definition of prices and tradable goods is developed.
