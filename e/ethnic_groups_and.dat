5|$|Geert Wilders {{has been}} charged in {{relation}} to incitement multiple times. Wilders was first accused of criminally insulting religious and <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> inciting hatred and discrimination. He {{was found not guilty}} in June 2011. In 2016, he landed in court again and was found guilty of incitement and encouraging discrimination against Moroccans.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Racial-Morphological Examinations of the Anterior Portion of the Lower Jaw in Four Racial Groups. This dissertation, {{completed}} in 1935 and {{first published in}} 1937, earned him a PhD in anthropology from Munich University. In this work Mengele sought to demonstrate that there were structural differences in the lower jaws of individuals from different <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> that racial distinctions could be made based on these differences.|$|E

5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> {{has been reported}} {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E

50|$|People in Zambia {{were not}} {{continuously}} counted by race before independence, {{and when they}} were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census asked about language but not <b>ethnic</b> <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> the 1974 census asked about <b>ethnic</b> <b>group,</b> but not language. The 1980 census asked about <b>ethnic</b> <b>group,</b> mother tongue, <b>and</b> language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census asked about <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> mother tongue. The 2000 census asked about <b>ethnic</b> <b>group,</b> language of most frequent use, and second language.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} supports {{the existence of}} humans in the region since prehistoric times. The region formed {{a part of the}} Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms (mahajanpads) during the Vedic age of Ancient India. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region. During the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom. In 1816, most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals, the proximity of different neighboring <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions which further strengthened during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|British {{buildings}} and organisations now commemorate her by name. One {{of the first}} was the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at Thames Valley University, which created the NHS Specialist Library for Ethnicity and Health, a web-based collection of research-based evidence and good practice information relating to the health needs of minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> other resources relevant to multi-cultural health care. There is another Mary Seacole Research Centre, this one at De Montfort University in Leicester, and a problem-based learning room at St George's, University of London is named after her. Brunel University in West London houses its School of Health Sciences and Social Care in the Mary Seacole Building. New buildings at the University of Salford and Birmingham City University bear her name, as does part of the new headquarters of the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street. There is a Mary Seacole ward in the Douglas Bader Centre in Roehampton. There are two wards named after Mary Seacole in Whittington Hospital in North London.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia is a polyethnic nation {{consisting}} of 80 different <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> 84 indigenous languages. Due to the diverse population {{and rural areas}} throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue {{had come to the}} forefront of political debate. Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. The Derg military government took control with a Marxist–Leninist ideology, urging self-determination and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the USSR broke apart, they lost their aid from the Soviet Union and the Derg government collapsed. Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a federal parliamentary republic. It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn. The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and democracy.|$|E

5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E
