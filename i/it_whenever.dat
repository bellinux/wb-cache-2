500|$|Piracy and banditry {{provided}} {{a significant and}} consistent supply of slaves, though {{the significance of this}} source varied according to era and region. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted <b>it.</b> <b>Whenever</b> ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as [...] "the old-fashioned" [...] way of life. Such was the case in Acarnania, Crete, and Aetolia. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with Illyrians, Phoenicians, and Etruscans. During the Hellenistic period, Cilicians and the mountain peoples from the coasts of Anatolia could also be added to the list. Strabo explains the popularity of the practice among the Cilicians by its profitability; Delos, not far away, allowed for [...] "moving myriad slaves daily". The growing influence of the Roman Republic, a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy. In the 1st century BC, however, the Romans largely eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.|$|E

500|$|In early 1844, Halkett {{successfully}} {{tested a}} prototype boat-cloak on the River Thames, paddling it [...] without taking on any water, despite, in his words, being [...] "met by—passed by—and almost run down by—various Metropolitan Steamers plying {{to and fro}} in their several vocations, and causing no little commotion in the troubled waters of the River". Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using <b>it</b> <b>whenever</b> the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett hoped to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the Bay of Biscay, but the weather was unusually calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that [...] "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant". The boat-cloak was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that [...] "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".|$|E

500|$|In 1987, Trent Reznor played {{keyboard}} in a Cleveland {{band called}} the Exotic Birds, then managed by John Malm, Jr. Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds {{to work on}} music of his own, Malm informally became his manager. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios, in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use <b>it</b> <b>whenever</b> it was empty, commenting that it cost him [...] "just a little wear on [...] tape heads". While completing the early recordings, Reznor {{was unable to find}} a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.|$|E

What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E
