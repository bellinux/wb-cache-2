40|$|AbstractThe {{positive}} outcomes of FDI inflows from <b>developed</b> or <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{are well known}} from the literature. However, the recent declining trend from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> {{and the emergence of}} FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> at a huge amount have triggered our interest on the issue whether (or not) FDI from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are more risk averse than FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This could imply that FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> could be contributing more towards economic development in host <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Focusing on Malaysian manufacturing sector, this study attempts to identify the risk averseness of FDI from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> against FDI from <b>developing</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

50|$|Important {{differences}} between <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> require that civil service and other reforms first rolled out in <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> be carefully adapted to local conditions in <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> {{and has the}} fifteenth-highest nominal {{per capita}} income {{globally}} {{as well as the}} tenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G7 (formerly G8), the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{basis for}} including <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{in efforts to}} reduce emissions is that emission cuts {{are thought to be}} less expensive in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> than <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p. 30; Grubb, 2003, p. 159). For example, in <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (Sathaye et al., 2001, p. 387-389). Thus, it is widely thought that there is greater potential for <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> to reduce their emissions than <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{negotiations}} {{have been}} split along a developing-country/developed-country divide. <b>Developing</b> <b>countries</b> wanted to negotiate on changes to S provisions, keep proposals {{together in the}} Committee on Trade and Development, and set shorter deadlines. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> wanted to study S provisions, send some proposals to negotiating groups, and leave deadlines open. <b>Developing</b> <b>countries</b> claimed that the <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> were not negotiating in good faith, while <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> argued that the <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> were unreasonable in their proposals. At the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial, members agreed to five S provisions for least <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (LDCs), including the duty-free and quota-free access.|$|R
5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E

Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth-largest military budget, used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index. Its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world. Japan is well-known internationally for its major contributions to science and modern-day technology.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
50|$|Usually <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> have a {{positive}} or high natural increase rate. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> have a negative/neutral or low natural increase rate, but many <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> have their population increasing due to immigration despite their negative RNI. These countries also have the lower rate of death. This is because <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are in different stages of the demographic transition. <b>Developing</b> <b>countries</b> are generally in the earlier stages of the transition meaning they have high fertility, which would show an increase in crude birth rates. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> usually have lower or more stable fertility rates so they don't show as high rates in natural increase. This {{can be applied to}} mortality rates as well, because <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> generally have higher mortality rates than <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> High mortality rates are due to differences in deaths from chronic and acute diseases.|$|R

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%.

5|$|New Zealand is a <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> and ranks highly in {{international}} comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a market economy. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} on international trade, particularly in agricultural products. Exports account for 24% of its output, making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns.

Its major export partners are Australia, United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a <b>developed</b> <b>country.</b> The service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction. Tourism plays {{a significant role in the}} economy, contributing $12.9 billion (or 5.6%) to New Zealand's total GDP and supporting 7.5% of the total workforce in 2016. International visitor arrivals are expected to increase at a rate of 5.4% annually up to 2022.|$|E

5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E
