40|$|The PrimWood Method. Part 2 : A new {{production}} concept for manufacturing of knot free and form stable wood with vertical annual rings. The PrimWood Method is a {{new production}} concept for manufacturing of high quality boards, components and panels from softwoods and hardwoods. The method generates knot-free boards, components and panels with vertical annual rings. The PrimWood Method increases {{the quality of the}} wood, compared to wood processed with traditional methods (harder surface, increased shape stability, <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> <b>cracks,</b> easier and faster processing, less waste and a more even finishing). The wood is also given new aesthetical characteristics (e. g. even texture, knot-free surfaces and decorative finger-joints). The PrimWood Method also improves the raw material utilization, with resulting positive environmental effects, since a renewable resource is utilized more efficiently.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part the structural behaviour of sandwich beams using timber-based facings and foamed plastic cores was studied. Various available theories were examined and the most appropriate theory for this type of panel was identified. In an extensive test programme the relevant properties of the constituent materials were measured and the data used in the proposed theory of structural behaviour to predict beam deflections and core and facing stresses. Corresponding sandwich beam tests were carried out on the range of skin/core combinations and the theoretical and experimental behaviours were compared. Good agreement was confirmed within the range of span/depth ratios investigated, confirming the applicability of the theory for semi-thick timber-based facings. A variety of timber based facings were investigated and those most suitable for sandwich construction were identified. This type of panel construction has many advantages but lacks the benefit of good fire resistance. The recF. iired fire resistance could be provided by a suitable core material. Part two of the research concentrated on {{the development of a new}} core material which was intended to have good structural properties at reasonable density, and to have adequate fire resistance free from the production of smoke and toxic fumes. Coated paper honeycombs were chosen for the study. The properties of the constituent materials were investigated in detail and then the structural properties of the developed cores were measured using methods drawn from national and international standards. One particular coating combination proved to be effective in terms of stiffness, fire resistance, <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> micro <b>cracking</b> and strength retention at high temperature. This was based on a mixture of sodium silicate and ball clay. Cores were tested both with cells empty (to be blocked by intumescence) and with cells filled (e. g. with lightweight filler). In the best of the developed cores, shear stiffness and transverse stiffness were much higher than in normal core materials. On the basis of the test programme, panels can be designed to give a fire resistance defined by insulation of up to two hours...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND JAFNPP design {{criteria}} (Ref. 1) requires. and SLs ensure, that specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during steady state operation. normal operational transients, and abnormal operational transients. The fuel cladding integrity SL is set such that no significant fuel damage is calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. Because fuel damage {{is not directly}} observable, a stepback approach is used to establish an SL. such that the MCPR {{is not less than}} the limit specified in Specification 2. 1. 1. 2. MCPR greater than the specified limit represents a conservative margin relative to the conditions required to maintain fuel cladding integrity. The fuel cladding is one of the physical barriers that separate the radioactive materials from the environs. The integrity of this cladding barrier is related to its relative <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> perforations or <b>cracking.</b> Although some corrosion or use related cracking may occur during the life of the cladding, fission product migration from this source is incrementally cumulative and continuously measurable. Fuel cladding perforations, however, can result from thermal stresses, which occur from reactor operation significantly above design conditions. While fission product migration from cladding perforation is just as measurable as that <b>from</b> use related <b>cracking,</b> the thermally caused cladding perforations signal a threshold beyond which still greater thermal stresses may cause gross, rather than incremental, cladding deterioration. Therefore, the fuel cladding SL is defined with a margin to the conditions that would produce onset of transition boiling (i. e [...] MCPR = 1. 00). These conditions represent a significant departure from the condition intended by design for planned operation. The MCPR fuel cladding integrity SL ensures that during normal operation and during abnormal operational transients, at least 99. 9 % of the fuel rods in the core do not experience transition boiling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{demonstrate}} the tension between human security's core categories of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want. The two core categories of human security are often held to be complementary to each other. However, by applying a human security analysis to the War on Drugs in Bolivia, particularly {{with reference to the}} ideas of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want, {{it can be seen that}} the War on Drugs in Bolivia typifies a <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear approach. This is illustrated through the War on Drugs focus on protecting individuals from physical violence and human rights abuses relating to situations of conflict, as well as its use of coercion strategies, such as sanctions or non-unilateral force; all of these of which are usual to a <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear approach. An examination of how the War on Drugs has impacted upon the individuals of Bolivia reveals that despite the desired outcome of protecting individual safety and well-being, the War on Drugs has actually compromised the safety and well-being of Bolivians. In addition, in typifying <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear, the War on Drugs in Bolivia has also challenged <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want by marginalising or threatening economic, community, food and health security, and thus defying claims that <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want are complementary. This thesis concludes that by pursuing political and personal security, <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear marginalises and even contests food, health, environmental and most especially economic and community security - the focal points of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want. Security policies adopted to address transnational threats in developing countries must ensure that they not only account for the <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear and <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want components of human security, but that they also account for, and manage, the potential for <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> fear to undermine the wider goals of <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> want...|$|R

The definition of torture is given, the principle of jus cogens is discussed, and the general situation of torture in Africa is reviewed.

In particular, the African Charter and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child are discussed and emphasis is put on the mechanisms in those treaties and how such mechanisms have been used to protect the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> torture. On the role of the African Commission and how it has used its mechanisms to protect the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> torture, the article looks at how torture has been dealt with in the seminars and workshops organised by the African Commission, how the African Commission has laid down rules and co-operated with other African and international institutions to protect the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> torture, and how it has protected the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>from</b> torture through individual communications.
