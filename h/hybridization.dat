5|$|<b>Hybridization</b> {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive <b>hybridization.</b> Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through <b>hybridization.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hybridization</b> may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that <b>hybridization</b> offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once <b>hybridization</b> has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E
5|$|Plant <b>Hybridization</b> is more commonplace {{compared}} to animal <b>hybridization.</b> Many crop species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid wheats: some have {{four sets of}} chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most eukaryotic organisms) two sets (diploid), so <b>hybridization</b> events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.|$|E
40|$|In {{a typical}} gene {{expression}} profiling experiment with multiple conditions, a common reference sample {{is used for}} co-hybridization with the samples to yield expression ratios. Differential expression for any other sample pair can then be calculated by assembling the ratios from their <b>hybridizations</b> with the reference. In this study we test the validity of this approach. Differential expression of a sample pair (i, j) was obtained in two ways: directly, by <b>hybridizations</b> of sample i versus j, and indirectly, by multiplying the expression ratios for <b>hybridizations</b> of sample i versus pool and pool versus sample j. We performed gene expression profiling using amphibian embryos (Xenopus laevis). Every sample combination of four different stages and a pool was profiled. Direct and indirect values were compared and used as the quality criterion for the data. Based on this criterion, 82 % of all ratios {{were found to be}} sufficiently accurate. To increase the reliability of the signals, several widely used filtering techniques were tested. Filtering by differences of repeated <b>hybridizations</b> was found to be the optimal filter. Finally, we compared microarray-based gene expression profiles with the corresponding expression patterns obtained by whole-mount in situ <b>hybridizations,</b> resulting in a 90 % correspondence...|$|R

5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: <b>hybridization</b> without introgression, <b>hybridization</b> with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. <b>Hybridization</b> is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic <b>hybridization.</b>|$|E
5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that <b>hybridization</b> takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. <b>Hybridization</b> also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{technology is}} {{a powerful tool for}} monitoring gene expression or for finding the location of DNA-bound proteins. DNA microarrays can suffer from gene-specific dye bias (GSDB), causing some probes to be affected more by the dye than by the sample. This results in large measurement errors, which vary considerably for different probes and also across different <b>hybridizations.</b> GSDB is not corrected by conventional normalization and has been difficult to address systematically because of its variance. We show that GSDB is influenced by label incorporation efficiency, explaining the variation of GSDB across different <b>hybridizations.</b> A correction method (Gene- And Slide-Specific Correction, GASSCO) is presented, whereby sequence-specific corrections are modulated by the overall bias of individual <b>hybridizations.</b> GASSCO outperforms earlier methods and works well on a variety of publically available datasets covering a range of platforms, organisms and applications, including ChIP on chip. A sequence-based model is also presented, which predicts which probes will suffer most from GSDB, useful for microarray probe design and correction of individual <b>hybridizations.</b> Software implementing the method is publicly available...|$|R

5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific <b>hybridization</b> and is likely required for <b>hybridization</b> between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote <b>hybridization.</b> The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote <b>hybridization</b> as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in <b>hybridization.</b> The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by <b>hybridization.</b> One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa, a few {{records of}} <b>hybridization</b> with the white-faced {{whistling}} duck {{have been noted}} in the wild, although {{in most parts of}} southern Africa, the two species breed at different times, bicolor during the dry season (April to September) and viduata during the rains (October to March). <b>Hybridization</b> in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the <b>hybridization</b> of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through <b>hybridization</b> have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that <b>hybridization</b> in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E

5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant <b>Hybridization</b> and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and <b>hybridization</b> in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of <b>hybridization</b> in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though <b>hybridization.</b> As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether <b>hybridization</b> is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
