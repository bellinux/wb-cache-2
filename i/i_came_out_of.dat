But when the march started {{to get all the}} {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E

500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for the Savannah Film Festival, Carlos Serrano of District wrote that though {{the subject matter}} covered a lot of ground, it {{utilized}} an efficient presentation: [...] "Sounds like a lot to put in to one movie, but the film manages to {{make good use of}} its 85 minute running time." [...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a solid film. ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the womb. I looked back up at my mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
2500|$|The Seder is {{a ritual}} {{performed}} by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling {{of the story of}} the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. [...] This story is in the Book of Exodus (Shemot) in The Hebrew Bible. [...] The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: [...] "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt.'" [...] (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10). The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.|$|E

2500|$|The prologue {{on earth}} shows the righteous Job blessed with wealth and sons and daughters. The scene shifts to heaven, where God asks Satan (ha-satan, {{literally}} [...] "the accuser") for {{his opinion of}} Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job had, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill all of his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: [...] "Naked <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be {{the name of the}} Lord." [...] God allows Satan to afflict his body with boils. Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to [...] "curse God, and die," [...] but Job answers: [...] "Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Precipitated by an {{unhealthy}} weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, {{and a recent}} relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Gamaliel {{said that}} one needed to mention three things on Passover to {{discharge}} one's duty: the Passover offering, unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah), and bitter herbs (maror). The Passover offering was sacrificed because God passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt. They ate unleavened bread because the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. And they ate bitter herbs because the Egyptians embittered {{the lives of the}} Israelites in Egypt. In every generation, all were bound to regard themselves as though they personally had gone out of Egypt, because [...] says, [...] "You shall tell your child in that day: ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Egypt.'" [...] Therefore, it was everyone's duty to thank and praise God for performing those miracles for the Israelites and their descendants. God brought them forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore, they were to say hallelujah! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed.

Gauci explained, [...] "That's where <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my shell. I didn't have anyone {{telling me what to}} do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do.

Tune in Tokyo's second single, [...] "Ray of Love", appeared in April 2012.|$|E

As soon as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I {{did not realize that}} they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
