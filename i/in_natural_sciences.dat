It is harder to judge the contribution of women to research, as the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.|$|E
5|$|Moser {{was born}} on 13 March 1924 in Innsbruck, Austria, to parents Margaretha and Josef Moser. His father was a teacher at a {{technical}} college in the city, while his mother {{was the daughter of}} noted botanist Emil Johann Lambert Heinricher. Moser attended primary school and grammar school in the city, and showed an interest <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> from a young age. His interest was cultivated by Heinricher, and Moser's earliest paintings of mushrooms date to 1935 when he was 11 years old.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b> The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of campaigns he {{recovered}} the provinces of Jazira, Thughur and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids {{in the east and}} the Tulunids in the west that secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph's lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences,</b> renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E
5|$|After showing {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> in his youth, {{he studied}} at the University of Innsbruck. However, his university career was interrupted {{by the need to}} complete military service. He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II, before being captured and placed in a prisoner of war camp. He was released in 1948, subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies. After completing his doctorate in 1950, Moser worked in England for six months, researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Upon his return to Austria, he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute, where he remained until 1968, taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation. He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956, and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of Microbiology in Austria. He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991. His studies continued until his death in 2002. An influential mycologist, he received a number of awards throughout his life, and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are 1) {{to find out whether}} there is a different effect of SEQIP Model and ConventionalModel on students' learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science.</b> 2) to examine whether there is a different effect between students with high creativity and those with low creativity on their learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science,</b> and 3) to know whether there is a significant interaction between the two learning models and students' creativity on their learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science.</b> This research employs an experimental method. The population of the research were all students of 41 state elementary schools in Ngadirojo Sub district of Wonogiri Regency. Selected with cluster random sampling technique, the research samples were 60 students, consisting of 30 students for experimental group using the SEQIP Model and 30 students for control group employing the Conventional Model. A test was administered to collect data about creativity and learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science.</b> The research data were analyzed using two-path variance analysis with prerequisite analysis test, that is normality test with Kolmogorov test and homogeneitytest with F test. Based on the research findings it is concluded that 1) there is a significant different effect of SEQIP Model and Conventional Model on students' learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science</b> (F count > F table or 14. 85 > 4. 02), 2) there is a significant different effect between students with high creativity and those with low creativity on their learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science</b> (F count > F table or 35. 59 > 4. 02). and 3) there is a significant interaction between the two learning models and students' creativity on their learning achievement <b>in</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science</b> (F count > F table or 5. 18 > 4. 02) ...|$|R

According to the first law of thermodynamics, all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the second law diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.|$|E
