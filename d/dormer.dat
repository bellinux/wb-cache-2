5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable <b>dormer,</b> decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present <b>dormer</b> replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|The mansion's roof {{is covered}} by gray slate and is further embellished with three <b>dormer</b> windows facing from the home's front façade. The roof is topped by a balustraded deck. Similar {{moulding}} contours were used at varying scales throughout the mansion's exterior construction. The mansion's cornice is composed of ornamented moldings.|$|E
5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, {{and would have}} been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the <b>dormer</b> windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dormers</b> Wells or <b>Dormer's</b> Wells {{is a small}} {{suburban}} {{community in}} west London, {{and part of the}} London Borough of Ealing and the Southall post town area. The area has a large secondary school, <b>Dormers</b> Wells High School. There is also a local primary school, playcentre, nursery and community centre. There are also a few small village-style communities like Mount Pleasant, Telford and Allenby. There is also an old people's home in <b>Dormers</b> Wells.|$|R
50|$|Wall <b>dormers</b> {{are less}} {{commonly}} seen than typical “roof dormers”. They locate the window {{flush with the}} wall plane above or through the cornice line. They are essentially {{a continuation of the}} wall above the roof eaves. They are thus more of a vertically projecting wall element than an elaboration of the roof. Unlike roof <b>dormers,</b> wall <b>dormers</b> tend to feature highly ornamental window surrounds. Also in contrast to roof <b>dormers,</b> they generally offer little or no increase in floor space or head room.|$|R
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and <b>dormer</b> windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by <b>dormer</b> windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The <b>dormer</b> windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E

5000|$|The Classroom/Dormitory building, {{also known}} as St. Mary's Hall, was built as an {{addition}} to Cambria Place from 1884 to 1885. [...] It is a two-story, rectangular plan structure built on a high basement. Designed in a late Victorian Eclectic style, it is capped with a high hipped mansard roof. It features large gabled wall <b>dormers</b> and small wood roof <b>dormers.</b> Round arch windows {{are found in the}} roof <b>dormers</b> below a pediment. Both the wall and the roof <b>dormers</b> have gable roofs that are flared at the eaves. The cornice is broad and it is decorated with large fan-shaped wooden brackets.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} uses of <b>dormers</b> was {{in the form of}} lucarnes, slender <b>dormers</b> which provided ventilation to the spires of gothic churches and cathedrals. An early example are the lucarnes of the spire of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.|$|R
5|$|Modifications to {{the house}} include the {{addition}} of a large pediment-shaped <b>dormer</b> that projects {{from the center of the}} main roof and is lighted by a rectangular double window. Part of the veranda was enclosed and the stairs that lead to a formal garden were removed. Above the center of the veranda is a second-story projection that was described as visually compromising the elegance of the rear facade.|$|E
5|$|The Colross mansion is a two-story, brick, Georgian-style {{structure}} that features an architectural plan {{similar to those}} of Mount Vernon and Woodlawn, and was originally flanked by two wings. The front entrance is covered by a spacious Neoclassical portico supported by wooden doric columns. The roof is topped by a balustraded deck and is further embellished by three <b>Dormer</b> windows.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of <b>dormer</b> windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
40|$|Photograph (streetscape, {{horizontal}} photography) of {{the exterior}} view of Saint Mary's church in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, between 1880 - 1915. The church, designed by R. B. Young, stands about three-stories tall and is {{situated on the}} corner of the street. A set of stairs leads to the bell tower. There is a cross on the peaks of each gable and on top of the spire of the bell tower. At left, a cross stands on each of the two windowless <b>dormers.</b> Above these <b>dormers</b> is a pair of vented <b>dormers.</b> The two windowless <b>dormers</b> flank a stained glass window with the figure portraying Jesus(?). Utility poles, palms, and trees line the sidewalks along the dirt roads...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, small early {{buildings}} {{are found to}} have wall <b>dormers.</b> More commonly, later structures (during the period of revival styles in 19th-century architecture) feature wall <b>dormers</b> as {{an important part of}} eclectic assemblies of elements that make up such styles as the Queen Anne style.|$|R

5|$|On {{the main}} (north) facade, {{there is a}} two-bay-wide {{projection}} with a hip roof and two wall dormers. There is a large roof <b>dormer</b> on the side (east) facade which provides exterior access to the hayloft. Other fenestration includes small square windows with fixed sashes near the eaves on all facades and four double-hung windows, two per level, in the main facade's pavilion. Each end facade has a set of large double wood carriage doors. The complex now serves as a storage and maintenance facility for the club's golf carts.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{is located}} in New London, Connecticut. Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with a Greek Revival portico leading to the main entrance. Additions to the house include a {{projecting}} center <b>dormer,</b> and second-story projection over a partially enclosed veranda. The plain exterior is contrasted by interior's elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces.|$|E
5|$|The east front {{looks more}} medieval {{than the other}} sides but {{probably}} dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled <b>dormer</b> windows, and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E

Above it is a molded stone cornice and frieze, carved in foliage and flowers, which extends around the towers. The windows are complemented by two <b>dormers</b> similar to, but larger than, the tower <b>dormers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised exemplar of the garden suburb and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and <b>dormer</b> windows with some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. An oval path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens are planted in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E
5|$|The term ildebrandshuse (English: fire houses) today {{refer to}} a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in the years {{immediately}} after the fire. Many of them were modelled on generic renderings made by Johan Cornelius Krieger with inspiration from Christof Marselis. The houses are two or three storeys high, five bays wide and have a prominent wall <b>dormer.</b> The façade towards the street is in brick {{while the rest of the}} house has timber framing. They are typically painted in bright colours. Well-preserved examples are today found in locations such as Gråbrødretorv and Gammel Mønt.|$|E
5|$|When {{the auction}} closed, it had {{received}} the third highest number of viewers of Trade Me auctions, at 459,420 views. The winning bid was $26,000, placed by a consortium of eight demolition contractors who currently undertake demolitions in the Christchurch Central City (D Construction, <b>Dormer</b> Construction, Jurgens Demolition, March Construction, Pro Tranz Contracting, Clampet Developments, Shilton and Brown Demolition, and Ward's Demolition). They gave {{the right to choose}} a person to push the button to the Child Cancer Foundation, who nominated a six-year-old boy from Queenstown.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortress}} {{heritage of}} the rural, royal residences of the Loire was not lost in the transfer to New York. The roof-line is very fine....The Gothic {{is found in the}} high-pitched roof of slate, the high, ornate <b>dormers</b> and the tall chimneys. The enrichment is early Renaissance, especially at the center <b>dormers</b> on both facades of the building, which boast colonnettes, broken entablatures, finials on high bases, finials in relief and volutes. In fact, although the <b>dormers</b> are ebullient, ornamentation is everywhere, even in the diamond-shaped pattern in relief on the chimneys (traceable to Chambord).|$|R
50|$|The {{ranch house}} was built in 1910. It is a -story rustic Victorian style building. The building’s {{foundation}} is tuff-stone. The same stone was used to construct the first story structure. The upper level and roof are wood framed. The house has a high gabled roof with two brick chimneys and six gable <b>dormers,</b> three {{on the front and}} three on the back. The center <b>dormers</b> on the front and back of the house are larger than the outer <b>dormers.</b> The front porch runs the length of the building and is supported by square wooden posts. There is a second-story balcony above the porch. The <b>dormers</b> and the top portions of the main gable ends of the house are finished with fishscale wood shingles. There are Victorian style details on the second-story frieze, fascia boards, and support brackets around the <b>dormers.</b> The windows on the main level of the house are double-hung wood windows. The front <b>dormers</b> have tall, double-hung, two-over-two wood sash windows, while the rear <b>dormers</b> have simple casement windows. In the 1950s, a one-story addition was built onto northeast corner of the house. The addition has a gabled roof with board-and-batten siding. The main entrance to the ranch house is {{at the north end of}} the addition. Inside, on the first floor of the original house, there is a large living room, kitchen, dining room, and bathroom. The one-story addition houses a sun porch, walk-in cooler, mud-room, and a small bathroom. Upstairs there are four bedrooms and a bathroom.|$|R

5|$|During the English Civil War {{between the}} {{supporters}} of Charles I and Parliament, Weymouth was predominantly Parliamentarian in loyalty and the surrounding forts were held by their garrisons. Robert <b>Dormer,</b> the Earl of Carnarvon, entered Dorset with an army in 1643 and Weymouth surrendered, resulting in Sandsfoot Castle being controlled by the Royalists between August 1643 and June 1644. During this period the castle {{may have been used}} as a Royalist mint. Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, then retook the county for Parliament; Colonel William Ashburnham, the Royalist governor of Weymouth, retreated to Portland Castle without a fight. Devereux approached Sandsfoot and, after three hours of negotiations, the fort surrendered to him. In 1647, Parliament ordered the garrison at the castle to be demobilised but this did not occur, and John Hayne was appointed as its new captain.|$|E
5|$|In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) {{sets off}} {{wildfire}} beneath the Great Sept, killing its occupants, including the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce) and Queen Margaery Tyrell (Natalie <b>Dormer),</b> causing {{the suicide of}} King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman).
