25|$|Since 2002, {{television}} programming {{trends in}} Southeast Asia began {{to undergo a}} drastic change as TV series from South Korea and Taiwan filled the slot originally reserved for Hollywood movies during prime time. Although dramas from South Korea gradually overtook those from Taiwan, much of Asia still had their <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> Taiwanese bands such as F4, S.H.E and Fahrenheit. The breakthrough for K-pop came with the debut of TVXQ, SS501 and Super Junior, the latter hailed by the BBC as a household name in the region.|$|E

She could feel its warmth on her back.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the utter}} {{weakness}} of the Indians that saved Smoke and Shorty from being overborne. In five minutes the wall of up-standing, on-struggling Indians had been changed to heaps of fallen ones that moaned and gibbered in the snow, and cried and sniveled as their staring, swimming <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the grub that meant life to them and that brought the slaver to their lips. And behind it all arose the wailing {{of the women and}} children.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the center of the}} lens and the retina (focal length) varies from approximately 17 mm to about 14 mm, as the refractive power of the lens increases from its minimum to its maximum. When the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> an object farther away than about 3 m, the lens exhibits its lowest refractivee power. When the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> a nearly object, the lens is most strongly refractive.|$|R

5000|$|To {{view the}} stereogram, <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a point behind the image {{by a small}} amount until the two images [...] "snap" [...] {{together}} [...]Note that viewing the identical images from step 2 in this manner will work, but the whole area will appear at the same depth. The shifted region produces the binocular disparity necessary to give a sensation of depth. Different shifts correspond to different depths.Another way to view it is to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a point {{in front of the}} images i.e. make [...] "cross eyes" [...] and force the images to snap together having your left <b>eye</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the right image and your right <b>eye</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the left image.|$|R
60|$|So chill a wind {{of hatred}} blew {{from the outer}} office that the normal comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by losing that {{approval}} of his employees to which an executive is always slave. Ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy directions {{to the effect that}} there would undoubtedly be important tasks to-morrow, and Miss McGoun and Miss Bannigan would do well to be there early, and for heaven's sake remind him to call up Conrad Lyte soon 's he came in. To-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness. He was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> him, Miss McGoun staring with head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan looking over her ledger, Mat Penniman craning around at his desk in the dark alcove, Stanley Graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before the bleak propriety of his butler. He hated to expose his back to their laughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was raucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door.|$|E

50|$|The Magic Eye {{images have}} a {{horizontally}} repeating pattern which differs slightly with each repetition, therefore giving {{the illusion of}} depth when each <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> {{a different part of}} the pattern. The stereograms were created using a patented process that allows colorful patterns to be used in creating the final images.|$|R

All <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> Allison, {{as he was}} {{recovering}} from his injuries the previous weekend during The Winston. Allison spent two days in the hospital, nursing a broken collarbone, re-injured ribs and bruises covering 60% of his body. After winning at Daytona and Talladega, Allison was eligible for the Winston Million if he was victorious at Charlotte. Allison had won the Coca-Cola 600 in 1991, and Charlotte was considered Robert Yates's best track.|$|E

50|$|On 13 March 2002, Karadas {{signed for}} Rosenborg BK, {{reportedly}} receiving death threats over this move.

He further enhanced his reputation by scoring two goals against Inter Milan in a UEFA Champions League game, a 2-2 home draw; he was linked with the likes of Roda JC, Liverpool and Udinese Calcio, but Portuguese club S.L. Benfica eventually bought the 23-year-old, and he joined the squad of veteran coach Giovanni Trapattoni after signing a four-year contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner ear}} {{contains}} the vestibular system, {{which is also}} known as the organ of equilibrium. About the size of a pencil eraser, the vestibular system contains two distinct structures: the semicircular canals, which detect changes in angular acceleration, and the otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule), which detect changes in linear acceleration and gravity. Both the semicircular canals and the otolith organs provide information to the brain regarding the body’s position and movement. A connection between the vestibular system and the eyes helps maintain balance and keep the <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> an object while the head is moving or while the body is rotating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absent-minded}} {{professor is}} a stock character often depicted in fictional works, usually as a talented academic whose focus on academic matters {{leads them to}} ignore or forget their surroundings. This stereotypical view {{can be traced back}} as far as the philosopher Thales, who it is said, [...] "walked at night with his <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the heavens and, as a result, fell down a well". One classic example of this is in the Disney film The Absent-Minded Professor made in 1963 and based on the short story [...] "A Situation of Gravity," [...] by Samuel W. Taylor. Two examples of this character portrayed in more modern media include doctor Emmett Brown from Back to the Future and Professor Farnsworth of Futurama.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} given an {{audience}} score of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7,130 user ratings with an average rating of 3.5\5. Vincent Canby from the New York Times said it was [...] "funny, unpretentious and fast-paced. It {{has a kind of}} comicbook appreciation for direct action and no time whatsoever for mysticism or for scenery for its own sake, though most of it was shot in Morocco and is fun to look at". The Boston Globe called it a [...] "slow-paced, incompetently directed film with both <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the box office". Variety magazine said, [...] "The Black Stallion Returns {{is little more than a}} contrived, cornball story that most audiences will find to be an interminable bore".|$|E
5000|$|This {{rather small}} {{painting}} (approximately 24” x 18”), shows Kahlo in a frontal position and directly confronting the viewer’s {{gaze from the}} canvas. Her bold eyebrows hold the emphasis on her face, as a thorn necklace strangles her throat, trailing down her chest like the roots of a tree. A small black hummingbird with its wings outstretched hangs like a pendant from her throat. She is surrounded by insects and animals, setting {{the scene of a}} lush, but suffocatingly dense jungle. A monkey sits behind her right shoulder, its <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> its hands, tugging at the thorn necklace, causing Kahlo to bleed. Above her head, two dragonflies float in mid-air, above two butterfly clips nesting in the elaborate hairstyle that crowns her head. A black panther with striking ice blue eyes peers over her left shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|The goal of {{the golf}} swing is to direct as much kinetic energy as {{possible}} into the club head so when it comes {{into contact with the}} ball, all of the energy will transfer to the ball, sending it into flight. The complex motion of the body first starts with the stance. This is critical to make sure the golfer has a low center of gravity to remain balanced throughout the swing path. The swing starts with the arms moving back in a straight line. When the club head reaches the level of the hip, two things happen: there is a stern wrist cock that acts as a hinge along with the left knee (for a right handed swing), building up its torque by moving into the same line as the belly button {{before the start of the}} upswing. As the swing continues to the top of the backswing (again for right-handed golf swing), the golfer's left arm should be perfectly straight and his right arm should be hinged at the elbow. The downswing begins with the hips and the lower body rather than the arms and upper body, with emphasis on the wrist cock. As the golfer's hips turn into the shot, the right elbow will drop straight down, hugging the right side of the golfer's torso. [...] As the right elbow drops, the wrists begin to snap through from the wrist cock in the backswing. A solid extension of the arms and good transfer of body should put the golfer leaning up on his right toe, balanced, with the golf club resting on the back of the golfers neck. Importantly, all of the movements occur with precise timing, while the head remains completely still with <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the ball throughout the entire swing.|$|E
