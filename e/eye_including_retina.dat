40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{is becoming}} an increasingly important modality for the diagnosis and management {{of a variety of}} eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic macular edema (DME). Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT), an advanced type of OCT, produces three dimensional high-resolution cross-sectional images and demonstrates delicate structure of the functional portion of posterior <b>eye,</b> <b>including</b> <b>retina,</b> choroid, and optic nerve head. As the clinical importance of OCT for retinal disease management and the need for quantitative and objective disease biomarkers grows, fully automated three-dimensional analysis of the retina has become desirable. Previously, our group has developed the Iowa Reference Algorithms ([URL] a set of fully automated 3 D segmentation algorithms for the analysis of retinal layer structures in subjects without retinal disease. This is the first method of segmenting and quantifying individual layers of the retina in three dimensions. However, in retinal disease, the normal architecture of the retina - specifically the outer retina - is disrupted. Fluid and deposits can accumulate, and normal tissue can be replaced by scar tissue. These abnormalities increase the irregularity of the retinal structure and make quantitative analysis in the image data extra challenging. In this work, we focus on the segmentation of the retina of patients with age-related macular degeneration, the most important cause of blindness and visual loss in the developed world. Though early and intermediate AMD results in some vision loss, the most devastating vision loss occurs in the two endstages of the disease, called geographic atrophy (GA) respectively choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In GA, because of pathological changes that are not fully understood, the retinal pigment epithelium disappears and photoreceptors lose this supporting tissue and degenerate. Second, in CNV, the growth of abnormal blood vessels originating from the choroidal vasculature causes fluid to enter the surrounding retina, causing disruption of the tissues and eventual visual loss. The severity and progress of early AMD is characterized by the formation of drusen and subretinal drusenoid deposits, structures containing photoreceptor metabolites - primarily lipofuscin - the more drusen the more severe the disease and the higher the risk of progressing to GAD or CNV. Thus, to improve the image guided management of AMD, we will study automated methods for segmenting and quantifying these intraretinal, subretinal and choroidal structures, including different types of abnormalities and layers, focusing on the outer retina. The major contributions of this thesis include: 1) developing an automated method of segmenting the choroid and quantifying the choroidal thickness in 3 D OCT images; 2) developing an automated method of quantifying the presence of drusen in early and intermediate AMD; 3) developing an method of identifying the different ocular structures simultaneously; 4) studying the relationship among intraretinal, subretinal and choroidal structures...|$|E

The absence of melanin results in abnormal development of eyes and leads to problems with focusing, and depth perception. [...] The eyes of albino animals appear red because the colour of the red blood cells in the retina can be seen through the iris, which has no pigment to obscure this. [...] Some albino animals may have pale-blue eyes due to other colour generating processes. [...] Albino vertebrates exposed to intense light typically lose photoreceptors due to apoptosis.|$|R

Results. IGF-I mRNA was demonstrated over ganglion cells of the retina and endothelial cells of the choroid and ciliary processes. IGF-IR mRNA showed more extensive distribution, localizing to the retinal ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, and outer limiting membrane and also the outer nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary processes and cornea, conjunctiva, and lens. IGFBP- 2 mRNA localized to outer nonpigmented epithelia of the ciliary processes and the germinal layer of corneal epithelium as well as iris, conjunctiva, and sclera. Messenger RNAs for IGFBP- 3 to IGFBP- 6 localized to choroidal endothelial cells and chromatophores and also to the inner pigmented epithelium of the ciliary processes. Messenger RNAs for IGFBP- 5 and IGFBP- 6 were seen in {{the inner and outer}} nuclear layers of the neural retina. IGFBP- 1 mRNA was not detected within the rat eye. Conclusions. Using in situ hybridization, we have demonstrated mRNAs for IGF-I, IGF-IR, and IGFBP- 2 to IGFBP- 6 in specific histologic layers of the retina, choroid, ciliary body, and cornea in the rat.

40|$|During {{bacterial}} and viral infections, unmethylated CpG-DNA {{released by}} proliferating and dying microbes is recognized by toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in host cells, initiating innate immune responses. Many corneal infections occur secondary to epithelial breaches and represent {{a major cause}} of vision impairment and blindness globally. To mimic this clinical situation, we investigated mechanisms of TLR 9 ligand–induced corneal inflammation in mice after epithelial debridement. Application of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) resulted in neutrophil and macrophage infiltration to the cornea and loss of transparency. By 6 hours after CpG-ODN administration, TLR 9 mRNA was increased in the cornea and retina. In vivo clinical examination at 24 hours revealed inflammatory infiltrates in the vitreous and retina, which were confirmed ex vivo to be neutrophils and macrophages, along with activated resident microglia. CpG-ODN–induced intraocular inflammation was abrogated in TLR 9 −/− and macrophage-depleted mice. Bone marrow reconstitution of irradiated TLR 9 −/− mice with TLR 9 +/+ bone marrow led to restored corneal inflammatory responses to CpG-ODN. Fluorescein isothiocyanate–CpG-ODN rapidly penetrated the cornea and ocular media to reach the retina, where it was present within CD 68 + retinal macrophages and microglia. These data show that topically applied CpG-ODN induces intraocular inflammation owing to TLR 9 activation of monocyte-lineage cells. These novel findings indicate that microbial CpG-DNA released during bacterial and/or viral keratitis can cause widespread inflammation within the <b>eye,</b> <b>including</b> the <b>retina...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{previously}} {{have reported}} that application of the intracellular toll-like receptor (TLR) - 9 ligand CpG-ODN onto the injured corneal surface induces widespread inflammation within the <b>eye,</b> <b>including</b> the <b>retina.</b> We tested the hypothesis that topical application of two other intracellular TLR agonists, Poly I:C and R 848, would cause retinal microglial activation and migration into the subretinal space. METHODS: C 57 BL/ 6 J wild-type and Cx 3 cr 1 gfp/+ mice were anesthetized and received central corneal abrasions followed by topical application of Poly I:C (TLR 3 agonist), R 848 (TLR 7 / 8 agonist), or CpG-ODN (TLR 9 agonist). Eyes were imaged in vivo by using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography to assess and quantify vitreous cells and retinal edema. Tissues were processed for whole-mount immunofluorescence staining or gene expression studies. Microglial activation was determined by morphologic changes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II reactivity, and migration to the subretinal space. Expression of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL- 6, IL- 1 β, IFN-γ, and MCP- 1 in retinal tissues were analyzed. RESULTS: At 24 hours, topical treatment with CpG-ODN and R 848, but not Poly I:C, led to altered microglial morphology. One week after CpG-ODN and R 848 -treatment, eyes exhibited vitritis and mild inner retinal edema, increased number of subretinal Iba- 1 + cells, {{and an increase in}} MHC II+ cells in the neural retina. Proinflammatory cytokine genes were upregulated after R 848 treatment, whereas in the CpG-ODN group, only IL- 1 β and MCP- 1 were significantly upregulated. Retinal microglial activation was not observed in the Poly I:C-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of CpG-ODN and R 848, but not Poly I:C, to the damaged corneal surface can cause activation and migration of retinal microglia. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{cavefish}} morph of the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) {{is blind}} at adult stage, although an <b>eye</b> that <b>includes</b> a <b>retina</b> and a lens develops during embryogenesis. There are, however, two major defects in cavefish eye development. One is lens apoptosis, {{a phenomenon that}} is indirectly linked {{to the expansion of}} ventral midline sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression during gastrulation and that induces eye degeneration. The other is the lack of the ventral quadrant of the retina. Here, we show that such ventralisation is not extended to the entire forebrain because fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf 8), which is expressed in the forebrain rostral signalling centre, is activated 2 hours earlier in cavefish embryos than in their surface fish counterparts, in response to stronger Shh signalling in cavefish. We also show that neural plate patterning and morphogenesis are modified in cavefish, as assessed by Lhx 2 and Lhx 9 expression. Inhibition of Fgf receptor signalling in cavefish with SU 5402 during gastrulation/early neurulation mimics the typical surface fish phenotype for both Shh and Lhx 2 / 9 gene expression. Fate-mapping experiments show that posterior medial cells of the anterior neural plate, which lack Lhx 2 expression in cavefish, contribute to the ventral quadrant of the retina in surface fish, whereas they contribute to the hypothalamus in cavefish. Furthermore, when Lhx 2 expression is rescued in cavefish after SU 5402 treatment, the ventral quadrant of the retina is also rescued. We propose that increased Shh signalling in cavefish causes earlier Fgf 8 expression, a crucial heterochrony that is responsible for Lhx 2 expression and retina morphogenesis defect...|$|R
