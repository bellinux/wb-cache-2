5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to <b>discover.</b> <b>It</b> was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes.

5|$|Convinced that Fizzwidget is {{unaware of}} the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held on planet Boldan, only to <b>discover</b> <b>it</b> to be a trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss, after {{cancelling}} their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp. Captured, the pair find themselves transported to Aranos and aboard the same vessel, now {{being used as a}} remote prison, but manage to escape confinement. Discovering that Angela was captured by them, the pair track the mercenaries to their hideout on planet Snivelak, defeating their boss and saving Angela. Intent on stopping Fizzwidget, the group head for MegaCrop's Headquarters, only to discover that the CEO is none other than disgraced hero Captain Qwark. In a bid to restore his reputation, Qwark took over MegaCorp as Fizzwidget, with the intention of unleashing the Protopet upon the galaxy, so he can use a device created by Angela to defeat the creatures and make himself famous again. When he demonstrates the device, however, it malfunctions and transforms the original Protopet into a gigantic beast that devours him. While Angela goes to rescue the real Fizzwidget, Ratchet subdues the Protopet and saves Qwark's life. With Clank's help, Angela fixes the device and broadcasts a signal through MegaCorp's TV transponders, neutralizing the Protopets and restoring peace to the Bogon galaxy.|$|E

The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it.

5|$|In 1959, the Swedish team {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} Berkeley team's inability to detect element 102 in 1958, maintaining that they did <b>discover</b> <b>it.</b> However, later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a decay energy of 8.53612MeV. This hypothesis is lent weight {{by the fact that}} thorium-225 can easily be produced in the reaction used and would not be separated out by the chemical methods used. Later work on nobelium also showed that the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium, as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides. Thus, the Swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.|$|E
