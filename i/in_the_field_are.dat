5|$|The final {{images were}} {{released}} {{at a meeting}} of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. Once in the position, individuals are trained in the protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are competent to perform all experiments without supervision.. Practicing chemists already <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.|$|E
5|$|Literary works {{connected}} to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered {{a turning point in}} the reporting of professional sports.|$|E

25|$|In any dimension, the Ising {{model can}} be productively {{described}} by a locally varying mean field.

The field still has slow variations from point to point, as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.|$|E
25|$|Although older {{writings}} exist which {{deal with}} herbal medicine, the major initial works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> {{considered to be}} the Edwin Smith Papyrus in Egypt, Pliny’s pharmacopoeia and De Materia Medica (Περί ύλης ιατρικής), a five-volume book originally written in Greek by Pedanius Dioscorides. The latter is considered to be precursor to all modern pharmacopoeias, {{and is one of the}} most influential herbal books in history. In fact it remained in use until about CE 1600.|$|E
25|$|The {{two primary}} {{features}} {{used to identify}} this bird <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> its long wings and its white rump. The white patch on the rump can be seen while the bird is in flight. Its long wings extend beyond the tail by about a quarter inch. Baird's sandpiper also shows this trait but can be distinguished {{by the lack of}} a white rump. There is also a thin white stripe on the wing and a row of marks on the flanks below the wings.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} screech owls, scops owls {{have only a}} single type of call. This {{consists}} {{of a series of}} whistles or high-pitched hoots, given with a frequency of 4 calls per second or less, or of a single, drawn-out whistle. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. Some, like the recently described Serendib scops owl (Otus thilohoffmanni), were discovered because their vocalizations were unfamiliar to experts in bird-calls.|$|E

Other distinguished alumni and past faculty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> Mark Zemansky, Clarence Zener, Mitchell Feigenbaum, and Leonard Susskind.

25|$|Raw opium may {{be sold to}} a {{merchant}} or broker on the black market, but it usually does not travel far from the field before it is refined into morphine base, because pungent, jelly-like raw opium is bulkier and harder to smuggle. Crude laboratories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> capable of refining opium into morphine base by a simple acid-base extraction. A sticky, brown paste, morphine base is pressed into bricks and sun-dried, and can either be smoked, prepared into other forms or processed into heroin.|$|E

25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} south-eastern British Columbia consists of several small basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows {{that have been}} active for the past 3 million years. It is within the Wells Gray Provincial Park, which also includes the -high Helmcken Falls. The origin of the volcanism is unknown, but is probably related to crustal thinning. Some of the lava flows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those that}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon, where olivine nephelinite occurs. The last eruption in the field was about 400 years ago at Kostal Cone.|$|E
25|$|The Thar desert {{seems an}} ideal place for {{generation}} of electricity from wind power.

Rajasthan State Power Corporation has established its first wind power-based power plant at Amarsagar in Jaisalmer district. Some leading companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> working on establishing wind mills in Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner districts. Solar energy also has a great potential in this region as most of the days during a year are cloud free. Solar energy based plant has been established at Bhaleri in Churu district to convert hard water into drinking water.|$|E
25|$|The {{advances}} {{made in the}} Middle East in botany {{and chemistry}} led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote {{one of the most}} valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.|$|E
