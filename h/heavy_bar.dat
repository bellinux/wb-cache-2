25|$|The Type 100 {{was typical}} of the class of simple, inexpensive, wartime submachine guns {{produced}} by all military powers—designed for maximum ease of production. It is based on a simplified Bergmann MP18, modified for the 8mm Nambu round. It was an automatic-only, air-cooled, blowback weapon firing from an open bolt and feeding from a side-mounted, 30-round detachable box magazine. The barrel was given six-groove, right-hand-twist rifling. Unusually for a submachine gun (but typical of Japanese weapons of the era), a bayonet lug was fixed under the barrel, in this case with a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> and lug. Some of these models featured a bipod, and others featured a complicated muzzle brake.|$|E
500|$|The nomina sacra are {{contracted}} in {{the usual}} way, {{but there are a}} number of words which the scribe failed to abbreviate. In some of the cases where nomina sacra are uncontracted, they have the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> signifying contraction. υιος is contracted only once (John 4:47). On the other hand, it gives unusual abbreviations: for σταυρωσον (crucify) the manuscript has στωσον, for σταυρωθη — στρωθη, [...] (virgin) is contracted to παρνος.|$|E
60|$|They {{looked up}} at it. The sill was fully six feet from the ground. The window was {{a little over a}} foot wide, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> running down the centre, and cross bars.|$|E
50|$|The St Kilda wren is {{distinguished}} from the mainland form by its larger size and <b>heavier</b> <b>barring,</b> {{as well as its}} generally greyer and less rufous colouration. It differs from other Scottish island sub-species by its <b>heavy</b> <b>barring,</b> long and strong bill, and its greyer and paler plumage.|$|R
5000|$|They have <b>heavier</b> <b>bar</b> pressure, {{which makes}} them more tiring to fly ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Jim? What has happened?" [...] asked Bob, {{replacing}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> instantly the newcomer {{was inside the}} building.|$|R
60|$|Swinging the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> once around {{he struck}} {{the bottom of}} the joist which {{supported}} the shoring over head, and the heavy timbers, put up insecurely because they were to be used but temporarily, fell with a crash.|$|E
60|$|Back {{shot the}} bolt and up went the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar,</b> {{and as the}} door was opened to {{the width of a}} foot, the figure of a tall, heavily bearded frontiersman slipped into the cabin. He helped hold the door while Dan secured it again.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the three}} went toward {{the place of}} refuge at full speed, and behind the gate, having been warned by the report of her cousin's musket, Mary Pemberton stood ready to let down the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> when the little party was near at hand.|$|E
60|$|Prince Marvel laughed {{on reading}} this, and after getting {{down from his}} saddle he {{advanced}} to the iron gate and peered through its <b>heavy</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{he shook}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> with {{impotent}} strength, then bent {{his head as}} if to hide even from himself the few hot tears wrung from him by captivity and despair.|$|R
60|$|As I rose {{to my feet}} {{the first}} thing I saw was the {{malignant}} countenance of Issus glaring at me through the <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> of a grated door at {{one side of the}} chamber.|$|R
60|$|Venters rode on {{and stopped}} before Tull's cottage. Women {{stared at him}} with white faces and then flew from the porch. Tull himself {{appeared}} at the door, bent low, craning his neck. His dark face flashed out of sight; the door banged; a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> dropped with a hollow sound.|$|E
60|$|It was a sober-faced {{group that}} marched {{in through the}} big stockade gate, under the huge, bulging front of the fort, and up the rough stairway. Colonel Zane removed a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> from before a door, and thrust it open with his foot. The long {{guardroom}} brilliantly lighted by sunshine coming through the portholes, was empty save for a ragged man lying on a bench.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the farmer}} {{stepped out into}} the {{darkness}} and, treading noiselessly, at once disappeared from Harold's sight. The latter closed the gate, replaced the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar,</b> and stood with one hand on this and the other holding his rifle, listening intently. Once he thought he heard a low growling from one of the dogs, but this presently ceased, and all was quiet again. The gate was a solid one, formed of strong timbers placed at a few inches apart and bolted to horizontal bars.|$|E
50|$|The Undulated antpitta has {{dark brown}} upperparts with a gray crown and nape. The throat and moustachial region are white, {{separated}} by a black malar line. The underparts are orange to buffy with <b>heavy</b> <b>barring.</b>|$|R
50|$|In philately {{a killer}} is a {{particularly}} heavy type of handstamp consisting of <b>heavy</b> <b>bars,</b> cork impressions or other crude devices used to cancel postage stamps. Such handstamps may also be known as obliterators as the mark applied often obscures almost {{the whole of the}} stamp.|$|R
60|$|There was {{the sound}} of {{grounding}} of arms, of the drawing of bolts and the turning of a key in a complicated lock. The prison was kept locked from within, and very <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> had to be moved ere the ponderous door slowly swung open on its hinges.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{moments after}} the Fairy said to Prince Ahmed: [...] "See, there comes my brother." [...] The Prince {{immediately}} perceived Schaibar coming gravely with his <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> on his shoulder, his long beard, which he held up before him, {{and a pair of}} thick mustachios, which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his head, which was far from being of the smallest size, and on his head he wore a grenadier's cap; besides all this, he was very much hump-backed.|$|E
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram {{defends the}} chapel] But Sir Tristram wist {{that in a}} little the whole castle would be aroused against him, {{and that he would}} {{certainly}} be overwhelmed by dint of numbers, wherefore he looked about him for some place of refuge; and he beheld that the door of the chapel which opened upon the courtyard stood ajar. So he ran into the chapel and shut to that door and another door and locked and bolted them both, and set a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> of wood across both of them so that for a while he was safe.|$|E
60|$|They now {{measured}} {{the space between}} the warehouse and the wall, the Captain repeating the figures, still in a loud voice; then they discussed the height of the walls, and after some argument between the Captain and John Wilkes agreed that this should be the same {{as the rest of the}} building. Still talking on the subject, they returned through the warehouse, Cyril on the way taking a look at the massive gate that opened into the lane. In addition to a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> it had a strong hasp, fastened by a great padlock. The apprentices were busy at work coiling up some rope when they passed by.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{occur in}} 2 color morphs, in either brown or dark grey plumage. They have a round head with ear tufts, yellow {{eyes and a}} {{yellowish}} bill. The bird looks very similar to a western screech owl, but has <b>heavier</b> <b>barring</b> on the breast, and is slightly smaller in size.|$|R
2500|$|The variety [...] "Magna" [...] (or [...] "Magnum") is bred {{for more}} yellow and {{commands}} a premium price as a pet. [...] Some [...] "extreme" [...] Magnas {{have as much}} yellow as Tres Marías birds, but are distinguished from them by <b>heavier</b> <b>barring</b> on the chest and a less bluish tint to the green plumage.|$|R
50|$|Barrio Húmedo also {{features}} rock and <b>heavy</b> metal <b>bars,</b> glamorous nightclubs and Irish-style pubs.|$|R
60|$|Amidst the {{clattering}} {{of heavy}} blows, the rattling of broken glass, the cries and execrations of the mob, {{and all the}} din and turmoil of the scene, Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret-door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet; and spent their united force on that. It was a strong old oaken door, guarded by good bolts and a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar,</b> but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind, and made, as it were, a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above. Almost at the same moment, a dozen other points were forced, and at every one the crowd poured in like water.|$|E
60|$|He {{swung the}} bar high with both hands, and it {{descended on the}} negro's crown. The man went backwards, but another who carried a long gun sprang over him, and the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> came {{crashing}} down on his naked arm. Then it whirled again, {{and there was a}} curious thud as it left its mark upon a dusky face. There was a clamor from the men below, a gasp behind Nares, and a folded canvas chair struck the next negro on the breast. He, too, lost his balance, and in another moment the stairway was empty except for one of the dusky men who lay still upon the lower steps of it. Nares stood on the veranda, with a suffused face, and the perspiration dripping from him, and smiled curiously when {{the man in charge of}} the station glanced at him with wonder and a vague reproof in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|But not to sleep. He {{crouched}} on his snug dry bed of moss, and waited patiently till Battle's snores rose slow and mournful beneath the snow-piled roof. Then very quickly {{he put on}} his sheep's-coat over his Juzanda jacket and breeches. He crawled out, and lifted down with both hands the <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> of the door, and stole out into the moonlight again. He thrust his puckered hand under his jacket, and touched his skinny breast-bone, beneath which, ever since the little Horse of Tishnar had toppled him into the snow, he had felt the slumbering Wonderstone strangely burning. And, as if even Oomgar magic, too, might help him, he hobbled back into the hut and put Battle's little dog's-eared book into his pocket. Then, before his heart could fail him, he ran out as fast as his fours could carry him to where he had heard rise up in the night the Hunting-Song of Immanâla.|$|E
60|$|The battle now raged on all sides. The English {{strove to}} grapple with and board the enemy, while the Spaniards poured upon them a shower of bolts and quarrels from their cross-bows, hurled immense masses of stone from their {{military}} engines, and, as they drew alongside, cast into them <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> of iron, which pierced holes {{in the bottom of}} the ship.|$|R
60|$|But Inga {{was not at}} {{all sure}} they could not get in. The gates opened inward, and three <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> were held in place by means of stout staples riveted to the sheets of steel. The boy had been told that the power of the Blue Pearl would enable him to {{accomplish}} any feat of strength, and he believed that this was true.|$|R
50|$|The barred tinamou is {{approximately}} 25 cm in length. It is yellowish-buff with <b>heavy</b> <b>bars</b> of black on its back, its throat is white, its front {{and sides of}} neck and breast are pale grey, its belly is white, its flanks are cream barred with black, and its head and neck are chestnut in color with legs that are olive-green. The female is paler on back.|$|R
50|$|Punching may be done {{to create}} a {{decorative}} pattern, or to make a hole. For example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a <b>heavy</b> <b>bar</b> or rod for the hammer handle. Punching {{is not limited to}} depressions and holes. It also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting—all done with a chisel.|$|E

50|$|Duff's Brooklyn is a <b>heavy</b> metal <b>bar</b> {{located in}} Williamsburg, Brooklyn (168 Marcy Avenue, between South 5th and Broadway).|$|R
5000|$|A lonely figure, a dark {{silhouette}} or {{a single}} head between <b>heavy</b> <b>bars,</b> surrounded by wild strokes inside {{the perspective of a}} tunnel - motives like these run like a red thread through Soshanas whole work and have earned her a reputation as [...] "Cassandra of the canvas, a prophetess of doom, an artist of the Atomic Age, a painter of anxiety and loneliness, of disease and dementia, of unemployment, pain, and death." [...] (The Mainichi, Japan 1957) ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the pigs}} began to melt, rabelling began (as in the Walloon process) using two bars of iron one {{to stir the}} iron {{and the other to}} lift it back into the blast. Periodically the tuyere had to be cleaned of matter {{adhering}} to it with a third bar. Finally, the iron was gathered into a 'loop' which was lifted out of the hearth with a <b>heavier</b> <b>bar</b> and tongs, and taken to the shingling hammer.|$|R
