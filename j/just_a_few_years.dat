5|$|In 1919, {{the highway}} {{that is now}} M-99 was first signed as M-64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M-34 from Hillsdale to the Litchfield area. In 1924, the western {{terminus}} of M-34 was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming {{an extension of the}} M-64.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was dated c. 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s, mainly by matching {{the style and}} fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends. In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged. Max Friedländer proposed a number of dates and an ordering of works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting, but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The new church was completed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then met up with M-96 just inside the Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} on a major route way brought death and destruction to the town on many occasions. In 1069, {{in an attempt to}} quell rebellion in the north, the area between the Ouse and the Tyne was laid to waste by the armies of William the Conqueror. The town of Northallerton was almost totally destroyed or depopulated. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later it is described in the Domesday Book as modo est in manu regis et wastum est (put down as waste). In 1318, the town was destroyed again by the Scots, under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed.|$|E

5|$|Route172 {{originated}} as {{alignment of}} State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering. In the 1953 renumbering, State Highway Route S-28 was reassigned as Route18. However, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after {{the designation of}} NJ 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass around New Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route27, and Route18 was moved onto that alignment. The former alignment of Route18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection with Commercial Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route172.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the demise}} of wooden covered bridge would be seen, as a storm, dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year. The storm struck both communities, and the bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll {{collector}} on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross. At 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below. Remnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed {{on the side of}} the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> before. After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.|$|E

25|$|Already Gustav I of Sweden {{appointed}} exceptionally many Finnish nobles as High Councillors of the Realm, {{partly because}} of trust and loyalty, partly because almost all adult male Swedish high nobles had been efficiently axed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of <b>years</b> earlier by Christian II and thus were not available for appointments.|$|R
5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|This taxon has a {{long and}} {{convoluted}} nomenclatural history. It was originally described as Agaricus gloiocephalus by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1815 and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. The French mycologist Claude Gillet transferred it in 1878 to the genus Volvaria erected by Paul Kummer <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> earlier in 1871. The name Volvaria was already taken, {{as it had been}} coined by De Candolle for a genus of lichens in 1805. The generic name Volvariella, proposed by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899, would eventually be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer’s Volvaria against De Candolle’s Volvaria was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was signed around July 1, 1919, M-34 started in Jonesville at an {{intersection}} with M-23 along the present-day alignment of M-99. The highway ran to Adrian along its present route and continued southeasterly along present-day US223 through Blissfield, where it terminated at the Ohio state line near Sylvania, Ohio. In 1924, the western terminus {{of the highway}} was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming {{an extension of the}} M-64 of the day. At the same time, the eastern segment of M-34 from Adrian to the border was assumed into the US127 corridor, therefore, scaling the terminus back to US127 (now US223).|$|E

5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|Naturalist {{and popular}} artist John Gould {{illustrated}} {{and described the}} koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845–63) and introduced the species, {{as well as other}} members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> before. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.|$|E
