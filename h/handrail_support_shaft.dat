Inclined {{treadmill}} {{walking is}} a commonly performed activity to increase cardiovascular health. <b>Handrail</b> <b>support</b> {{on a treadmill}} provides an individual the opportunity to change their posture {{with respect to the}} walking surface. Differences in metabolic cost during inclined walking due to postural changes with handrail use are unknown.

50|$|A {{handrail}} is a rail that {{is designed}} to be grasped by the hand so as to provide stability or <b>support.</b> <b>Handrails</b> are commonly used while ascending or descending stairways and escalators in order to prevent injurious falls. <b>Handrails</b> are typically <b>supported</b> by posts or mounted directly to walls.|$|R
40|$|Coordination {{of dynamic}} balance during gait {{training}} {{in people with}} acquired brain injury. Objective: To investigate movement {{of the center of}} mass (COM) during different gait training methods in people with neurologic conditions. Design: Coordination of the gait cycle, represented by mediolateral COM displacement amplitude, timing, and stability, was assessed during a variety of gait training methods performed in a single session. Setting: Gait laboratory. Participants: People who were unable to walk unassisted due to an acquired brain injury (n= 17) and healthy control subjects (n= 25). Interventions: The participants performed 7 alternative gait training methods in a randomized order. These were therapist manual facilitation, the use of a gait assistive device, treadmill walking with <b>handrail</b> <b>support,</b> and 4 variations of body weightsupport treadmill training with combinations of <b>handrail</b> and/or therapist <b>support.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Mediolateral COM movement was analyzed in terms of displacement amplitude (overall range of motion), timing (relative to stride time), and stability (steadiness of the movement). Normative values for these measures were acquired from 25 healthy participants walking at a self-selected comfortable pace. Results: Body weightsupport treadmill training without any additional support resulted in significantly (P<. 05) greater amplitude, altered timing, and reduced movement stability compared with nonpathologic gait. Allowing <b>handrail</b> <b>support</b> or therapist facilitation reduced this effect and resulted in treadmill training (± body weight support) having lower movement amplitudes when compared with the other training methods. Therapist manual facilitation most closely matched nonpathologic gait for timing and stability. Conclusions: In the context of overall dynamic gait coordination, no single method of training provides the optimal stimulus. A training program that uses a variety of techniques may provide a beneficial rehabilitation response. © 2012 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|R
50|$|Built on {{the site}} of some old water mills, the dam creates a grade in the {{riverbed}} through the use of two abutments, one on each bank of the river, and five interior buttresses. The buttresses, which sustain the bridge and the six sluice gates, also hold up the metal structure bearing the machines that operate the gates. The abutment on the right bank forms an arched portal over the roadway and houses the access stairway to the control room, whose crowning octagonal turret once bore a dome. This dome, the horseshoe arch and alfiz, the simple and double windows, and the <b>handrail</b> <b>supports</b> all belong to the Neo-Mudéjar style.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} a barre—which {{includes}} both the <b>handrail</b> and its <b>support</b> mechanism—depends on whether the barre is to be portable or permanently located. A permanent barre typically consists of a handrail that is mounted to and supported by a wall, whereas a portable barre consists of a handrail mounted onto a rigid or adjustable, free-standing supporting structure. Some barres have two parallel handrails at different heights to accommodate people of differing heights. Barre <b>handrails</b> and <b>supports</b> are typically made of metal, wood, plastic, {{or a combination of}} these materials.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the forging}} {{sequences}} for <b>support</b> <b>shaft,</b> the female {{die in the}} process of backward extrusion suffered a wicked stress condition, which was responsible for a short service life. The objective {{of this paper is to}} improve the stress condition through optimizing the parameters of multi-layer die, such as the sizes stress rings and shrink-fits. The process of backward extrusion was simulated by DEFORMTM package, and then the node forces on the boundary between workpiece and die were translated into ANSYS. The ANSYS module (APDL) was applied to seek the optimal set of parameters based on the failures of the stress rings in multi-layer die at the same time. In this optimization, a two- and a three-layer dies were taken into consideration for. The optimized parameters will be used as a guideline for the practice application and the strategy used in this study can be extended to the other processes for the <b>support</b> <b>shaft</b> and other extruded products...|$|R
40|$|Most {{balancing}} {{procedures for}} flexible shafts involve {{the use of}} trial weights. The few techniques purporting to predict the shaft unbalance mathematically rely on modelling the system from measured characteristics. The bearings are dfficult to model and the technique presented in the present paper evades the necessityfor doing this. A technique is presented whereby the unbalance on a rotating shaft can be directly calculated from running Vibration; no explicit representation of the bearing characteristics is required.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of balance support on the energy cost of treadmill and overground walking in ambulatory patients with stroke. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Research laboratory at a rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients with stroke depending on a walking aid in daily life (n= 12; walking aid dependent ambulators) and walking aid independent ambulators (n= 12), all able to walk for at least 5 minutes. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Energy cost (J. kg(- 1). m(- 1)) and temporal gait parameters (walking speed, mean and coefficient of variation of stride time, and symmetry index) were obtained during 4 walking trials at preferred walking speed: overground with and without a cane and on a treadmill with and without <b>handrail</b> <b>support.</b> Results: On the treadmill, <b>handrail</b> <b>support</b> resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} energy cost of 16 %, independent of the group. Although walking aid dependent ambulators had on average a larger reduction in energy cost than walking aid independent ambulators (19 % vs 14 %), this interaction did not reach statistical significance (P=. 11). Interestingly, overground walking with support resulted in an 8 % reduction in energy cost for walking aid dependent ambulators, but a 6 % increase for walking aid independent ambulators. The reduction in energy cost with support was accompanied by changes in temporal gait parameters, most notably an increase in stride time and symmetry and a decrease in stride time variability. Conclusions: Balance support can result in a significant reduction in the energy cost of walking in stroke patients, the magnitude of which depends on walking ability and the walking task. Impaired balance control should not be overlooked as a contributing factor to the increased energy cost of walking in patients with stroke, and improving or assisting balance control should be considered to reduce the energy cost of hemiplegic gait.
