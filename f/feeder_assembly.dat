40|$|A {{flexible}} {{system for}} determining the quality of agricultural products based on characteristics such as, for example, mass, shape, hardness, size, color and surface texture is disclosed herein. The quality determination apparatus includes a <b>feeder</b> <b>assembly</b> for sequentially dropping individual product samples upon an impact transducer arrangement. The impact transducer generates transducer signals indicative of the physical characteristics of each product sample. In addition, an imaging device operates to synthesize a digital image representation of each product sample. The transducer signal and digital image representation corresponding to each product are analyzed so as to determine the appropriate degree of quality to be associated therewith...|$|E
40|$|Hundreds of Oyjord and “Oyjord-like ” cell {{wheels and}} {{mechanical}} distributors remain in use globally, some more than 40 years old. Spare parts, new units and upgrades are included. These include cell wheels {{of different sizes}} and lamellae spacing cast with different numbers, as well as deeper than normal lamellae, (suited to metering larger than normal seeds / fertilizer and other particles / sizes of samples) and distributor impellors of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. Such specialized units have been fabricated at additional cost rather than being cast routinely, for want of improved pattern making and casting ideas and procedures as developed recently under the Flexiseeder Project 7 by S&N International Ltd in association with SLU 8, BACD 9, The Casting Shop, Collins Patterns and Geoff Gray Ltd. These improved Flexiseeder technologies including an improved cell wheel / portion <b>feeder</b> <b>assembly</b> are introduced and described in this technical note together with details of two modern hard-wearing, low-friction materials that are being used in combination with traditional materials to improve efficiency and to reduce costs. These technologies have been put into the public domain. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Flexiseeder is a voluntary global team effort in which {{the authors wish to}} gratefully acknowledg...|$|E

Harbord's String Quartet won First Prize at last year's Kiwanis Festival. The Chamber Orchestra has performed at other venues such as Massey Hall, and George Weston Hall. The Strings Chamber Orchestra plays at school {{events such as}} the Awards <b>Assembly,</b> <b>Feeder</b> School Concert and Senior Concert, and accompanies the Cantemus Choir.|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of printed circuit boards, electronic components are attached to a blank board {{by one or more}} pick-and-place machines. Frequent machine setups, though time consuming, can reduce overall processing time. We consider the Integrated Clustering and Machine Setup (ICMS) model, which incorporates this tradeoff between processing time and setup time and seeks to minimize the sum of the two. Solving this model to optimality is intractable for very large-scale instances. We show that ICMS is NP-hard and consequently propose and test a heuristic based on multi-exchange neighborhood search structures. Initial numerical results are very encouraging.

30|$|Trim lines 1 and 2 {{consist of}} 33 {{stations}} numbered from 41 to 73. While {{work is being}} carried out at Trim line, simultaneously chassis is loaded on chassis line consisting of workstations numbered from 1 to 17. Finish line starts from station 18 till 40. As the chassis passes along the conveyor, the body from the Trim line is placed onto the chassis at workstation 18. Parallel workstations viz. 3, 14, 15, 16, 38, 39, 40, Windshield and Electricals are called as <b>Feeder</b> stations. Similarly <b>assembly</b> lines of two more plants were studied. Plant B is commissioned on 31 st March 2009, manufacturing different models of car while Plant C is commissioned on 31 st March 2001 and manufactures different models of commercial vehicles. Lines were studied in terms of layout, automation level, inventory, cycle time, resources, material handling, ergonomics, etc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a flexible and vibratory bowl feeding system which is suitable for use in a flexible manufacturing system. The vibratory bowl <b>feeder</b> for automatic <b>assembly,</b> presents a geometric model of the feeder, and develops force analysis, leading to dynamical modeling of the vibratory feeder. Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder, and equating the vibratory feeder to a three-legged parallel mechanism, the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder, that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation. The analysis presents a dynamic model that integrates the angular displacement of the bowl with the displacement of the leaf-spring legs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{manipulation}} of polygonal parts using a simple device consisting of a grid of retractable pins on a vertical plate. This "Pachinko machine" is intended as a reconfigurable parts <b>feeder</b> for flexible <b>assembly.</b> A part dropped on this device may come {{to rest on the}} actuated pins, bounce out, or fall through. We select the equilibrium part configurations by selecting the set of actuated pins. Our objective is to automatically compute pin actuation sequences that bring the part to a goal configuration, without predicting the exact part motion between equilibria. Our approach is based on constructing the capture region of each equilibrium, i. e., the maximal subset of the part's configuration space such that any motion starting within it is guaranteed to reach the equilibrium. Reorienting a part reduces to constructing a directed graph whose nodes are the equilibria and whose arcs link pairs of nodes such that the first equilibrium lies in the capture region of the second one, and then finding paths in this graph from initial to goal states. We have implemented an algorithm to generate the capture regions and these paths, and have conducted experiments on a prototype Pachinko machine. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{manipulation}} of polygonal parts using a simple device consisting of a grid of retractable pins mounted on a vertical plate. This "Pachinko machine" is intended as a reconfigurable parts <b>feeder</b> for flexible <b>assembly.</b> A part dropped on this device may come {{to rest on the}} actuated pins, bounce out, or fall through. We propose a novel algorithm for part reorientation. Its input consists of the shape of a part, its initial position and orientation, and a goal configuration, and its output is a sequence of pin actuations that will bring the part to the goal configuration. The proposed approach does not attempt to predict the part motion between the equilibria associated with the active pins in the output sequence; instead, it constructs the capture region of each equilibrium, i. e., the maximal subset of the part's configuration space such that any motion starting within it is guaranteed to end at the equilibrium. Assuming frictionless contacts and dissipative dynamics, reorienting a part reduces to finding a path from initial to goal states in a directed graph whose nodes are the equilibria and whose arcs link pairs of nodes such that the first equilibrium lies in the capture region of the second one. The proposed approach has been implemented on a prototype of the Pachinko machine, and initial experiments are presented...|$|R
