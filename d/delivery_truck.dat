5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Mobile, Alabama, the second of Clovi and Marvella Smith's six {{children}} (five boys and one girl). While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at Brookley Air Force Base. When Smith was six {{his family moved to}} the Watts section of Los Angeles. His father became a <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> driver for Safeway stores, while his mother became an aide at a nursing home. His mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.|$|E
5|$|Andy's toys pursue Al, but {{are caught}} by Zurg, who battles the New Buzz, until Rex {{inadvertently}} knocks {{him off the}} elevator. The new Buzz then chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzz's father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andy's toys steal a pizza planet <b>delivery</b> <b>truck,</b> and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the baggage handling system. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm during a struggle, but Andy's toys overthrow Pete, where he ends up into a little girl's backpack. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to {{end up on the}} plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie, and the toys find their way home.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a <b>delivery</b> <b>truck.</b> Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
3000|$|Completing {{urban freight}} {{deliveries}} is increasingly {{a challenge in}} congested urban areas, particularly when <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> are required to meet time windows. Depending on the route characteristics, Electric Assist (EA) cargo bicycles may serve as an economically viable alternative to <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare the delivery route cost trade-offs between box <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> and EA cargo bicycles that have the same route and delivery characteristics, and to explore the question, under what conditions do EA cargo bikes perform at a lower cost than typical <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks?</b> [...]...|$|R

5|$|Buzz impresses {{the other}} toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares {{for a family}} outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody {{attempts}} to trap Buzz behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched {{a ride on the}} car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to {{make their way to the}} restaurant by stowing away on a pizza <b>delivery</b> <b>truck,</b> where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.|$|E

50|$|Divco was a {{brand name}} of <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> built and marketed in the United States. Divco is an acronym which stands for Detroit Industrial Vehicles COmpany. Divco became known for its multi-stop <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks,</b> {{particularly}} in use as home delivery vehicles by dairy producers. From 1926 until 1986, Divco produced trucks of various sizes and job descriptions.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} use {{evolutionary}} optimization, {{one has to}} define for every possible solution s {{to the problem of}} interest (i.e., every possible route {{in the case of the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>truck)</b> how 'good' it is. This is done by introducing a scalar-valued function f(s) (scalar valued means that f(s) is a simple number, such as 0.3, while s can be a more complicated object, for example a list of destination addresses in the case of the <b>delivery</b> <b>truck),</b> which is called the fitness function.|$|E

25|$|The company's {{first product}} was a {{gasoline-powered}} <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> engineered by Ford and completed in January 1900. It received favorable coverage {{in a local}} newspaper, but was not without its flaws; it was slow, heavy, unreliable and complicated to manufacture. Later in life, Ford recalled this period as one that was driven by profit rather than innovation.|$|E

It was during the Fox's leadership of Coca-Cola Mexico that Coke became Mexico's top-selling soft drink, increasing Coca-Cola's sales by almost 50%. Fox resigned from Coca-Cola in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{optimization}} {{techniques are}} particularly useful in {{situations in which}} it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard to go through all possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the <b>delivery</b> <b>truck,</b> but {{it is almost impossible to}} check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful).|$|E

25|$|A high f(s) {{implies that}} s {{is a good}} solution. In {{the case of the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>truck,</b> f(s) could be the number of {{deliveries}} per hour on route s. The best, or at least a very good, solution is then found in the following way: initially, a population of random solutions is created. Then, the solutions are mutated and selected for those with higher fitness, until a satisfying solution has been found.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} field of {{evolutionary}} biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., engineering or logistics problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a <b>delivery</b> <b>truck</b> with a number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.|$|E

30|$|Goodchild et al. [4] {{compare the}} effects of {{different}} goods-delivery methods in terms of distance travelled and carbon emissions impacts. The compared methods include traveling to the store by car and <b>delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> from depots to homes. The paper identifies customer density and emission ratio as key decision variables, and can further support better planning. <b>Delivery</b> <b>trucks</b> are expected to provide emission benefits where customer density is high (e.g. in an urban area), and where the emissions’ footprint of the truck {{is closer to the}} passenger car.|$|R
