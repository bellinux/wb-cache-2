40|$|A course-writing team {{needs to}} {{converge}} rapidly {{to what it}} regards as an agreed topic structure, which is <b>keyed</b> to agreed <b>learning</b> objectives, which specify relevant assessment questions in a natural learning sequence. Only then can the team members go away individually to write, knowing that everything that they write will fit together. In normal practice, this convergence is only partial: the topic structure harbors gaps, ambiguities and contradictions; the learning objectives are not keyed explicitly to the concepts in the topic structure; and questions for assessment of learners’ understanding do not directly exemplify conceptually <b>keyed</b> <b>learning</b> objectives. The result is courseware which does not help people to learn {{as well as it}} otherwise could, and which has been created with more effort than otherwise would have been needed.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{consensus}} among development practitioners and academics that improving market access for smallholders will lead to improvement in income and food security. This notwithstanding, market failures often limit smallholders’ ability to be linked to markets. To address these challenges, market interventions such as collective action is often proposed as a strategy to reduce the risks of market participation. This review synthesizes the <b>key</b> lessons <b>learned</b> from the use of collective action as institutional arrangement to improve market access for smallholder producers of agroforestry products with insights from an experience in Cameroon.

We prove our quantum-classical scheme secure under the notions of quantum semantic security, quantum entropic indistinguishability, and recent security definitions from the field of functional encryption.
