25|$|On June 14, Hamas gunmen {{completed}} {{the takeover of}} the central building of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service's headquarters in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas members took over vehicles and weapons in the compound, which was considered the Palestinian Authority's main symbol in the Strip. The Preventive Security Service cooperated with Israel in the past, and has been armed by the United States. It has been identified with Fatah powerhouse Mohammed Dahlan, who has become a figure hated by the Islamists in Gaza. The gunmen who entered the compound held a prayer there and waved a flag on the building's rooftop. At least 10 people were killed. Hamas TV broadcast a display of weapons inside the building, as well as jeeps, mortar shells and bulletproof vests seized in the compound, which according to Hamas, were smuggled to Fatah by Israel and the Americans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> through the border with Egypt.|$|E

The following week he was quoted as saying: [...] "There were times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix." [...] The season and his 21-year F1 career concluded with the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher finished seventh. He placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before the night of 16/17 December (OS), Rasputin had been invited to the Moika Palace at an unseemly hour, intimating Felix Yusupov's {{attractive}} wife, Princess Irina, would be present. She was really away in Crimea, staying with her parents-in-law. Yusupov, who had visited Rasputin regularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> for treatment, [...] went with Stanislaus de Lazovert to Rasputin's apartment in Dmitry's car. A soundproof room in the basement in the east wing had been specially prepared for the killing.

6000|$|... 'Read,' {{said the}} Colonel, {{with a sigh}} of relief.

60|$|First of all, {{he tried}} to {{estimate}} the risk of his being recognized {{as the man who}} had sold Jernyngham's land. If the suspicions of the agent he had dealt with were aroused, he might describe his customer to the police. Wandle was glad his appearance was by no means striking. When he sold the land, he had, however, worn a newly made suit of a rather vivid brown, which the man would probably remember. Wandle had bought it on a business visit to Brandon, which was a long way off, and the police could not have seen it when searching his house, because they had done so in his absence and when he left the farm to drive in to the settlement he had put on the clothes. There was a risk that somebody in Sebastian might remember how he was dressed, but, as he had been there only once or twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> he did not think it was likely.|$|E
