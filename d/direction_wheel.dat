40|$|A Reconfigurable Planetary Rovor System (RPRS) is presented, {{including}} the Parent body and some Child robots. The Child robot composed with the arm part and the wheel part has two moving modes: locomotion mode and manipulation mode. According to the mechanical characteristics, we proposed the two methods for the motion planning of swerving locomotion. The results of experiments {{showed that the}} robot can achieve turn during locomotion by adjusting the arm&# 39;s altitude. But the Child robot&# 39;s radius of left-hand turning motion during locomotion is bigger much than the radius of right-hand turning motion during locomotion and the effect is no obvious. The method of spot turning is presented by use {{of the difference between}} radial frictional force and tangential frictional force of ground and <b>direction</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is important for robot to autonomous locomotion.

50|$|A {{standard}} automobile is underactuated {{due to the}} nonholonomic constraints {{imposed by}} the wheels. That is, a car cannot accelerate in a direction perpendicular to the <b>direction</b> the <b>wheels</b> are facing. A similar argument {{can be made for}} boats, planes and most other vehicles.|$|R

50|$|Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines {{drive the}} front wheels. Using {{the front wheels}} for {{delivery}} of power as well as steering allows the driving force {{to act in the}} same <b>direction</b> as the <b>wheel</b> is pointing. This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars.|$|R
50|$|Squirm {{occurs when}} the scrub radius is at zero. When the pivot point is in the exact center of the tire footprint, this causes {{scrubbing}} action in opposite <b>directions</b> when the <b>wheels</b> are turned. Tire wear and some instability in corners is the result.|$|R
50|$|They {{are often}} used in {{intelligent}} robot research for small autonomous robots. In projects such as VEX Robotics, Robocup and FIRST Robotics, many robots use these wheels {{to have the ability}} to move in all <b>directions.</b> Omni <b>wheels</b> are also sometimes employed as powered casters for differential drive robots to make turning faster. Omniwheels {{are often used}} to allow for movement on the horizontal axis on a drivetrain, as well as forward and backward movement. Usually, this is achieved is by using an H-drive.|$|R
6000|$|The long narrow table {{under the}} big sycamores {{between the house and}} the adapted barn that Mr. Direck learnt was used for [...] "dancing and all that sort of thing," [...] was covered with a blue linen diaper cloth, and that too {{surprised}} him. This was his first meal in a private household in England, and for obscure reasons he had expected something very stiff and formal with [...] "spotless napery." [...] He had also expected a very stiff and capable service by implacable parlourmaids, and the whole thing indeed highly genteel. But two cheerful women servants appeared from what was presumably the kitchen <b>direction,</b> <b>wheeling</b> a curious wicker erection, which his small guide informed him was called Aunt Clatter--manifestly deservedly--and which bore on its shelves the substance of the meal. And while the maids at this migratory sideboard carved and opened bottles and so forth, the small boy and a slightly larger brother, assisted a little by two young men of no very defined position and relationship, served the company. Mrs. Britling sat {{at the head of the}} table, and conversed with Mr. Direck by means of hostess questions and imperfectly accepted answers while she kept a watchful eye on the proceedings.|$|R
50|$|The TPM {{also has}} a method of {{detecting}} the rotational <b>direction</b> of each <b>wheel</b> to identify {{which side of the}} vehicle the TPM is located and this information forms part of the message transmitted to the vehicle.

50|$|Olgierd Mikosza, the {{inventor}} of the system, claims that switching rails at intersections will be done at full speed of about 50 km/h, with a minimum spacing of 10 m. In addition, adding new intersections and stops should require very little modification to the current network. The pod's carriage wheels descend to grab the side of a triangular structural truss. To switch to another <b>direction,</b> the <b>wheels</b> {{on the other side of}} the carriage descend to grab a track on the other side, and lift the first side away.|$|R
25|$|Simple logic {{circuits}} interpret the relative timing to indicate which <b>direction</b> the <b>wheel</b> is rotating. This incremental rotary encoder scheme {{is sometimes called}} quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately quadrature phase. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.|$|R
50|$|In {{hopes of}} fomenting success, Donovan brought in Mickie Most {{to share the}} {{producer}} duties on his next album. The Cosmic Wheels sessions were recorded in Morgan Studios in London, England. In the UK at that time, glam rock ruled {{the top of the}} charts, defined by bands and artists such as T. Rex, Alice Cooper, and David Bowie among others. Several of these bands and artists claimed Donovan as a key influence in their music. This praise coupled with the chart success of the genre likely had great influence on the musical <b>direction</b> Cosmic <b>Wheels</b> would take.|$|R

50|$|A Johnson Bar is {{a control}} lever on a steam locomotive, {{used to control}} {{the timing of the}} {{admission}} of steam into the locomotive's pistons.

50|$|If {{the drive}} wheels aquaplane, {{there may be}} a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and {{indicated}} speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the car will suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, {{the back of the car}} will slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels aquaplane at once, the car will slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn. When any or all of the wheels regain traction, {{there may be a}} sudden jerk in whatever <b>direction</b> that <b>wheel</b> is pointed.|$|R

2500|$|Similar to its predecessors, {{the player}} can {{interact}} with characters in Mass Effect: Andromeda using a radial command menu where the player's dialogue options depend on <b>wheel</b> <b>direction.</b> Around the <b>wheel</b> are {{four types of}} responses that shape each conversation: emotional, logical, professional, and casual. In general, conversations are based on agreeing or disagreeing with participants. During some conversations, the player is prompted with an [...] "Impulse Action" [...] that offers an additional choice to what {{is available on the}} dialogue wheel. For example, an on-screen prompt to [...] "shoot" [...] might appear and be momentarily selectable. By conversing with non-player characters, Ryder can develop friendships and, in some cases, romantic relationships with them over time. During both dialogue and quest sequences, the player is sometimes tasked with making moral decisions that do not have a clear good/bad distinction but are intended to be more nuanced, marking a departure from the Paragon/Renegade morality system of prior titles in the series.|$|R

While moving over {{the top half of the}} wheel, the point travels to the right, in the same <b>direction</b> as the <b>wheel</b> itself. The opposite is true while traveling under the bottom half.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Relative {{motion of}} single {{abrasive}} is analyzed {{for the different}} applied directions of longitudinal ultrasonic vibration, and its locus is simulated in the present paper. The research {{results show that the}} locus in two-dimensional ultrasonic vibration is only similar to that in y-direction, and both are close to sinusoid curves. The width of grooves scratched by abrasive grains y-direction (axial <b>direction</b> of grinding <b>wheel)</b> is two times of the vibration amplitude, and the material removal rate increases remarkably. In case of x-direction (tangential <b>direction</b> of grinding <b>wheel)</b> ultrasonic vibration, abrasive grains with periodic force impact material surface with high frequency vibration, which make material fracture removal easy. Therefore, the high efficiency essence of material removal in two-dimensional ultrasonic grinding is revealed in view of locus. In addition, according to the results of grinding experiments, under same conditions good surface quality can be obtained in two-dimensional ultrasonic grinding and material removal rate in common grinding is the lowest. Consequently it is further proved that the method of two-dimensional ultrasonic vibration grinding is an effective one for ceramic materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of holonomic omnidirectionul vehicle which {{consists}} of wheel mechanisms without free rollers but with conventional tires is presented. We first present a concept of the new driving wheel mechanism with a tire in the conventional style such QS a rubber tire or a pneumatic tire,"Offset Steered Driving Wheel". The configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between a wheel axle and a steering axle along a <b>direction</b> of <b>wheel</b> traveling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of Offset Steered Driving Wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating a wheel axis and a steering axis independently. The wheel is non-holonomic system however, we introduce a control strategy to avoid a non-holonomic constraint...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from hand}} prayer wheels there exist large size fixed prayer wheels {{which are often}} aligned around Buddhist shrines and are {{set in motion by}} pilgrims who circum-ambulate the {{building}} in a clockwise <b>direction.</b> Prayer <b>wheels</b> larger than human size are to be seen in separate rooms in Tibetan Buddhist temples and can also be set in motion by pilgrims. With the help of a small bell the number of revolutions can be counted. The cylinders of fixed prayer wheels are often inscribed with the formula “Om mani padme hum” (meaning “jewel in the lotus”) in ornamental Lantsa (Ranjana) letters. Prayer wheels (perhaps more appropriately called “prayer mills”) which are set in motion by wind or water power are also known. They are used for prayer of Tibetan festival.|$|R
5000|$|With {{this basic}} setup Geniac could use combinational logic only, its outputs {{depending}} entirely on inputs manually set. It had no active elements at all - no relays, tubes, or transistors - {{to allow a}} machine state to automatically influence subsequent states. Thus, Geniac didn't have memory and couldn't solve problems using sequential logic.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{activate}} the retarder in the mechanical gears 2 to 4, the reverse gear brake, is closed. As a result, the turbine wheel is accelerated by a correspondingly high ratio and driven in 1st gear against the rotary <b>direction.</b> The turbine <b>wheel</b> now acts as an axial pump which delivers oil against the guide wheel and the braked or stationary impeller.During this process, kinetic energy is converted into heat which is dissipated by the heat exchanger.The vehicle is braked.|$|R
50|$|Several {{parts of}} the old lines had been winding with gentle {{gradients}} for the horses, which also had a braking effect in the downward <b>direction</b> with the <b>wheel</b> flanges pressing against the rails. Most of these curves were realigned and there were one or two changes in succeeding years. Most notably in 1871 a deviation was made which avoided Jessop's Kings Mill Viaduct and in 1892 a deviation to join the line from Nottingham south of Kirkby-in-Ashfield involving a gradient of 1 in 45.|$|R
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{wheel system}} is proposed for {{used as a}} microstepping displacement device including a carrier and two displacement members, which are separately pivoted on the carrier. Each displacement member includes two wheels, and which can not rotate. In addition, each wheel includes a wheel sheet and a piezoelectric element embedded on its surface. When the piezoelectricity element generates and transmits power to the wheel sheet, the wheel induces vibration and deformation. Therefore, owing to the wheel sheets and the touched ground involving their relative motion, the displacement device can be moved or can be oriented its motion <b>direction.</b> The <b>wheel</b> system involves direct movement, and has no rotor requirement. In this research, a three-dimensional (313) mechanical element with an extra electrical degree of freedom is employed to simulate the dynamic vibration modes of the linear piezoelectric, mechanical, and piezoelectric-mechanical behaviours of the piezoelectric wheel...|$|R

40|$|The alloy IN- 714 LC {{was used}} in an {{investigation}} of the effect of process parameters on the microstructure of a rapidly solidified melt-spun material. The resultant ribbon microstructure consisted of several distinct regions, each of which corresponds to a different thermal history during processing.

This zone develops into a dendritic growth morphology with distance away from the lower ribbon surface. Dendrites inclined in the <b>direction</b> of <b>wheel</b> rotation result from growth into a flowing stream.
