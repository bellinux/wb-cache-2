[...] "I have done it, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> every fourth night, {{and there is the}} milk and bread {{at the foot of the}} wall, ready for you to haul up as soon as it gets dark." ...|$|E
60|$|Louise did {{not come}} down till she heard Godolphin walking away on the plank. She said to herself that she had shipwrecked her husband once by putting in her oar, {{and she was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> When the actor's footfalls died out in the {{distance}} she descended to the parlor, where she found Maxwell over his manuscript at the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{he replied}} firmly. [...] "I didn't do {{anything}} of the kind. I drank too much! Much too much. Lots and lots too much! And, what's more, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again!</b> I'm {{going to do it}} every night. If ever you see me sober, old top," [...] he said, with a kind of holy exaltation, [...] "tap me on the shoulder and say, 'Tut! Tut!' and I'll apologize and remedy the defect." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did. Still, {{it seems}} {{scarcely}} likely that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> If anyone has located timber-rights--which he'd get for 'most nothing on a patent from the Crown--he has never worried about {{them until the}} Canopus began to pay. Of course, one has to put in timber as he takes out the ore, {{and it seems to}} have struck somebody that the men who started it on the Canopus had burnt off all the young firs they ought to have kept. That's why he bought those timber-rights up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no desire}} to fight the Romans, it is they who want to fight with me," [...] he replied; [...] "and as I {{have no desire}} for crucifixion, {{or any of the other}} forms of death which they bestow upon their captives, I have no choice but to resist. As you do not think any the worse of me, Aemilia, for having fought your countrymen before, I don't see that you can take it to heart that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{especially}} as you have very small reason to be grateful to them for the treatment that you and yours have received at their hands. You must remember, dear, that as my wife, you are a Briton now, and must no longer speak of the Romans as your people. Still, were it not for my countrymen, I would gladly bury myself with you in some cottage far up among the hills of Sicily, and there pass my life in quiet and seclusion. But without a leader the others would speedily fall victims to the Romans, and as long as the Romans press us, I must remain with them." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh {{that you}} had been at Clarence Terrace on Nina's birthday! Good God, how we missed you, talked of you, drank your health, and {{wondered}} what you were doing! Perhaps you are Falkland enough (I swear I suspect you of it) to feel rather sore--just a little bit, you know, the merest trifle in the world--on hearing that Mrs. Macready looked brilliant, blooming, young, and handsome, and that she danced a country dance with the writer hereof (Acres to your Falkland) in a thorough spirit of becoming good humour and enjoyment. Now you don't like to be told that? Nor do you quite like to hear that Forster and I conjured bravely; that a plum-pudding was produced from an empty saucepan, held over a blazing fire kindled in Stanfield's hat without damage to the lining; that a box of bran was changed into a live guinea-pig, which ran between my godchild's feet, and {{was the cause of}} such a shrill uproar and clapping of hands that you might have heard it (and I daresay did) in America; that three half-crowns being taken from Major Burns and put into a tumbler-glass before his eyes, did then and there give jingling answers to the questions asked of them by me, and knew where you were and what you were doing, to the unspeakable admiration of the whole assembly. Neither do you quite like to be told that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> next Saturday, with the addition of demoniacal dresses from the masquerade shop; nor that Mrs. Macready, for her gallant bearing always, and her best sort of best affection, is the best creature I know. Never mind; no man shall gag me, and those are my opinions.|$|E

5000|$|... "Once we {{came away}} {{with the success of}} February Son, we kind of fell into the trap that a lot of bands do that have success with their first one, who think 'Well, we're just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> -- let's go {{platinum}} this time.' We attempted to broaden the scope of what we were putting out there. Instead of just putting out rock songs, we had other types of music that we were exploring and we tried to put out a broader plain of music. That made it a little bit more difficult for people to get their head around it -- especially if they were into the rock and roll aspect of this band." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Fox News Channel's The Kelly File, UCLA School of Law professor Eugene Volokh said:"This kind of discussion has value in debate about Islam and {{about the role of}} Islam and about the reaction of some Muslims, fortunately {{only a small portion of}} Muslims do these kinds of things. But beyond that it has value as a reaffirmation of our free speech rights. It has value as an act of defiance. It has value as people saying: look, we are not going to be shut up. When you tell us that we cannot draw pictures of Mohammed, when you tell us we cannot say these things or else you'll kill us, that just means that we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and again to show that you cannot threaten Americans into submission." ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{days before}} Thanksgiving, Kendra Collins/Thompson (Morganna Bridgers) {{goes to the}} airport to meet her boyfriend, Daniel Torrens, {{returning}} from the military. They have sex at a motel and he leaves to get snacks from the vending machine. Kendra hears something and looks out the window. The Phantom smashes the window with her boyfriend's severed head. She jumps out of the bathroom window, breaking her leg as she lands. She limps to the car but is killed while trying to start it. Jami receives a phone call from Corey's phone. The Phantom tells her, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and again until you make them remember." [...] She decides to tell her police escort, Deputy Foster (Joshua Leonard), about the incident. The next day, residents secure their houses and go to a town meeting.|$|E
60|$|KIT. Pew, {{before we}} budge, let me shake your flipper again. You're heart of oak, Pew, sure enough; {{and if you}} can bring the Adam--Admirable about, why, damme, I'll make your fortune! How you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I don't know; but I'll stand by; and I know you'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if anybody can. But I'm drunk, Pew, you can't deny that; I'm as drunk as a Plymouth fiddler, Pew; and how you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is a mystery to me.|$|R

5000|$|... 2nd ball : Fleming again bowled full but Klusener {{also hit}} this ball hard {{along the ground}} past Mark Waugh, who was {{standing}} at long-off, for another boundary. Klusener had {{made his way to}} 31 runs off just 14 balls and South Africa were now level, but they still needed one more run to advance into the final. On this delivery, South African commentator Mike Proctor said [...] "He’s hit it hard...that’s Mark Waugh down there, he won’t get it - they are level! What kind of shot is that? That’s unbelievable, is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> for South Africa? He has done it on so many occasions. The first two deliveries of this over, he has gone bang, bang four, four - take that! Scores are level, South Africa need one to win to reach the final." [...] At that point, Bill Lawry reminded him that South Africa only had one wicket in hand and Australia would go through {{in the event of a}} tie.|$|E
5000|$|The Ball Exercise: Immediately after introductions, the {{facilitator}} arranges {{the group in}} a circle and asks each person to throw the ball to a person {{on the other side of}} the circle while stating their name. When every person in the group has thrown the ball at least once, {{the facilitator}} announces that [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> but this time we'll time it" [...] and announces the rules. 1) Each person must touch the ball in the same order as the first round. 2) Each person must touch the ball with at least one hand. 3) Time stops when the ball is returned to the facilitator. (For further complication, the facilitator will sometimes introduce three balls in succession to the process.) Regardless of their performance, the facilitator expresses disappointment with the group's performance and urges them to do it again faster. When asked for clarification, the facilitator only reiterates the rules. An effective team will creatively redesign their process to meet the requirements of the rules. After several iterations, the facilitator will call a halt and use the exercise to draw out morals which will be relevant later in the day such as [...] "Challenge assumptions", [...] "Don't be satisfied with the first answer", [...] "Be creative", etc.|$|E
