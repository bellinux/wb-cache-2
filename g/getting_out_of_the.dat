5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, {{a group of}} six boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli {{was the son of}} Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 2008, Staff Sergeant Petry and {{his unit}} {{were on a}} mission in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. He was {{assigned}} to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, which was on a daylight raid to capture a high-value target from the Taliban. Petry was to locate with the platoon headquarters in the target building once it was secured. Once there, he was {{to serve as the}} senior non-commissioned officer at the site {{for the remainder of the}} operation. The team of 70 Rangers encountered about 40 Taliban, 12 of them armed. Almost immediately after <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site, the Rangers came under strong fire. Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building, and afterward he took Private First Class Lucas Robinson to clear an outer courtyard.|$|E

5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a {{concrete}} barrier leaving the turn. Goethe was conscious but needed aid in <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, {{but was unable to}} get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

She said they raped her and Bates, afterward saying they would take them north or throw them in the river. She testified that she had fallen while <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gondola car, passed out and came to seated in a store at Paint Rock. Leibowitz questioned her until Judge Callahan stopped court for the day at 6:30. When he resumed the next morning, he pointed out many contradictions among her various versions of the rape.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} day, on the Sunday, Beattie's {{group had}} great difficulty <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hut {{because of the}} deep snow and in arduous conditions they were scarcely able to descend from the plateau.

The children were returned to Lagganlia while Beattie and Paisley drove to the ski centre where they were unable to learn any news. They then went to Glenmore Lodge and then Aviemore police station where at 19:00 they reported Davidson's party missing. Three pairs of rescuers were immediately dispatched from Glenmore Lodge into the blizzard and the night and the Cairngorm, RAF Kinloss, Braemar and Aberdeen MRTs were called out.

25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar {{around the neck of}} each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off his collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|E
25|$|Gio González {{started his}} second {{game of the}} series and had a rocky outing. Chicago′s leadoff hitter, left fielder Jon Jay, doubled on his second pitch. He lost his grip on his third pitch, and Jay {{advanced}} to third base when it sailed to the backstop. With one out, Jay scored on a ground-out by first baseman Anthony Rizzo to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. González walked two more Cubs before <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inning without further damage. In {{the bottom of the}} inning, with Chicago pitcher Kyle Hendricks making his second start of the series, Nationals shortstop Trea Turner led off with a double and advanced to third on a line out by left fielder Jayson Werth, but was thrown out at home while trying to score on a ground-out by right fielder Bryce Harper, and the Cubs preserved their early lead.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not tuned to the bars as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> percussion rental business since Emil was dominating {{much of the work}} in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E
