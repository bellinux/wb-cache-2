5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

When Lawrence divorced Gordon-Howley, she and Taylor became engaged and remained so for two years, with each free to enjoy a social life separate from the other.|$|E

500|$|Clarke's style {{extends to}} the novel's 185 footnotes, which {{document}} a meticulous invented history of English magic. At times, the footnotes dominate entire pages of the novel. Michael Dirda, in his review for The Washington Post, describes these notes as [...] "dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship", in which the anonymous narrator [...] "provides elaborate mini-essays, relating anecdotes from the lives of semi-legendary magicians, describing strange books and their contents, speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King". This extensive extra-textual apparatus is reminiscent of postmodernist works, such as David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest (1996) and Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon (1997), particularly as Clarke's notes humorously refer to previous notes in the novel. Clarke did not <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> publisher to accept the footnotes.|$|E

By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself?

500|$|Sue Ellen's storylines in {{the first}} season focus on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating {{relationship}} with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on {{the birth of her}} son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to be interesting."

So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How do you do that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out."

The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive.

[...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E

500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara {{will be able to do}} anything that you'd <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities should be able to do in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E

However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Rumors of {{a multimillion-dollar}} bidding war over Jackson's {{recording}} contract began to circulate in spring 1991.

The New York Times declared [...] "Janet Jackson has signed what {{is believed to be the}} most lucrative contract in the history of recording. The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and actress signed an exclusive contract with Virgin Records it was announced yesterday." [...] Her new contract guaranteed a twenty-two percent royalty payment, in addition to her then-historic signing bonus. Chuck Philips of the Los Angeles Times reported that it had been the largest bidding war in recent memory and that [...] "ne reason the bidding was so heavy, various industry observers have noted, was that Jackson-at just 24-is still a relatively fresh face on the pop scene and that her dance-pop style is ideal for today's pop/video climate." [...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist and we <b>expect</b> <b>her</b> growth to be enormous." [...] Chairman Richard Branson spoke with Jackson privately to seal the deal. He commented: [...] "A Rembrandt rarely becomes available...

The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT.
