5|$|The Sprouses began acting {{at the age}} {{of eight}} months {{following}} a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series Grace Under Fire.|$|E
25|$|Talkback was {{to become}} a major radio genre {{by the end of the}} 1960s, but it was not legalised in Australia until October 1967. The fears of {{intrusion}} were addressed by a beep that occurred <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> so that the caller knew that his/her call was being broadcast. There was also a seven-second delay so that obscene or libelous material could be monitored.|$|E

The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> as he waits for her response.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{microwave}} ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible {{functions such as}} a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, and popcorn. In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level {{does not affect the}} intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.|$|E
25|$|Methyl-B12 {{is absorbed}} by two processes. The first is an {{intestinal}} mechanism using intrinsic factor through which 1–2 micrograms can be absorbed <b>every</b> <b>few</b> hours. The <b>second</b> is a diffusion {{process by which}} approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed. The human physiology of vitamin B12 is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Protein-bound vitamin B12 must be released from the proteins {{by the action of}} digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Gastric acid releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore antacid and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B12.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Given the {{importance}} of continuous traffic flow forecasting in most of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications, where every new traffic data become available in <b>every</b> <b>few</b> minutes or <b>seconds,</b> the main objective {{of this study is}} to perform a multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting that can meet a trade-off between accuracy, low computational load, and limited memory capacity. To this aim, based on adaptive Kalman filtering theory, two forecasting approaches are proposed. We suggest solving a multi-step ahead prediction problem as a filtering one by considering pseudo-observations coming from the averaged historical flow or the output of other predictors in the literature. For taking into account the stochas-tic modeling of the process and the current measurements we resort to an adaptive scheme. The proposed forecasting methods are evaluated by using measurements of the Grenoble south ring. I...|$|R

The flea circus closed down in the late 1970s as improvements in domestic living conditions made human fleas more difficult to obtain.|$|E
500|$|The song of {{this species}} is delicate, and does not carry far. It is most {{commonly}} heard during the rainy season, but can be heard {{at any time of}} the day. The call is described as a thin, high-pitched and hesitant [...] "teep, tre'e'e'e'e'a eea wu'u'u'e'e'e-e-e-e-e-p" [...] or a [...] "twip, tsiweeé, tseee, ti-ti-ti-ti", according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World. The initial trill is described as rising and then falling, and the last trill is described as long. Birds may sometimes vary the pattern and only use part of the song. The species is also described as making a squeaky and undulating screech, and males are described as whistling on the nest. Foraging males have been observed making an ascending [...] "shreee" [...] <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> while hunting for insects.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the type}} {{and size of the}} race, there may be any of the {{following}} methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race <b>every</b> <b>few</b> minutes. An athlete's wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing. Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> apart.|$|R
50|$|The {{light at}} Presque Isle was not {{installed}} with {{any sort of}} flashing system, though the option was left available. Often, boats are able to distinguish between two different lights by a Flashing beacon. Either the beacon itself would rotate, and thus illuminate 360° around the lighthouse, or a blinder with {{only a small portion}} unshielded would rotate around the lamp, exposing the bright light for only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> The rotation was controlled by heavy weights that would slowly sink due to gravity. <b>Every</b> <b>few</b> hours the lightkeeper would “wind up” the rotating beacon or blinder. However, Presque Isle's light was a steady beacon.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a system combining a back-illuminated Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensor and Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) device for a soft X-ray (0. 5 - 10 keV) imaging spectroscopy observation of the Sun to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} solar corona. Because typical timescales of energy release phenomena in the corona span a few minutes at most, we aim to obtain the corresponding energy spectra and derive the physical parameters, i. e., temperature and emission measure, <b>every</b> <b>few</b> tens of <b>seconds</b> or less for future solar X-ray observations. An X-ray photon-counting technique, with a frame rate of a few hundred frames per second or more, can achieve such results. We used the Zynq SoC device to achieve the requirements. Zynq contains an ARM processor core, which is also known as the Processing System (PS) part, and a Programmable Logic (PL) part in a single chip. We use the PL and PS to control the sensor and seamless recording of data to a storage system, respectively. We aim to use the system for the third flight of the Focusing Optics Solar X-ray Imager (FOXSI- 3) sounding rocket experiment for the first photon-counting X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the Sun.

500|$|Rutting males {{fight over}} dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, {{probably}} {{to devote more}} time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female's urine to ensure that she is in oestrus. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the courtship by pursuing her, keeping a distance of [...] from her.

The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males.|$|E
500|$|Hanson is {{regarded}} as an intimidating but honest wrestler. The character he portrayed was hated by many fans, but Hanson was different from many heel wrestlers {{because he did not}} cheat to win matches. Even while competing as a heel, however, Hanson and Hawk were admired by many spectators and had a fan club devoted to them. In contrast to Hawk, who remained a heel during his entire run in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Hanson gained popularity with even more fans when he feuded with Hawk and became the promotion's top face wrestler. Writers who have looked back on his career have noted that he wrestled with [...] "heart" [...] and always worked his hardest in the ring. Hanson has had a lasting impact on the business, as he was willing to put over other wrestlers, including Blackjack Mulligan and Angelo Mosca to help boost their careers. He and Hawk also helped popularize the quick tag, which saw them trading places in the ring <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> to remain energized while their opponents became worn down.|$|E
