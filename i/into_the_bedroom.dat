5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom, where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E

25|$|Mutual consent is important, {{according}} to Casanova, but he avoided easy conquests or overly difficult situations as {{not suitable for}} his purposes. He strove to be the ideal escort in the first act—witty, charming, confidential, helpful—before moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> in the third act. Casanova claims not to be predatory ("my guiding principle has been never to direct my attack against novices or those whose prejudices were likely to prove an obstacle"); however, his conquests did tend to be insecure or emotionally exposed women.|$|E

40|$|Field {{testing was}} {{performed}} in a retrofit unoccupied test house in Fresno, California. Three air-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) distribution systems - a typical airflow ducted system to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> a low airflow ducted system to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> and a system with no ductwork to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> - were evaluated during heating, cooling, and midseason conditions. The relative ability {{of each of the}} three systems was assessed with respect to relevant Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) and ASHRAE standards for house temperature uniformity and stability, respectively. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling also was performed and refined based on comparison to field test results to determine the air flow rate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> of over-door and bottom-of-door air transfer grilles...|$|R

He managed to stagger <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and hide his coat, which had his only {{insignia}} of rank. The commander of the Union detachment, Maj. Douglas Frazar of the 13th New York Cavalry, entered the house and—not knowing Mosby's identity—inspected the wound and pronounced it mortal. Although left for dead, Mosby recovered {{and returned to the}} war effort once again two months later.|$|E

Mrs. Putnam is a bereaved parent seven times over; she blames witchcraft for her losses and Betty's ailment. Rebecca is rational and suggests a doctor be called instead. Mr. Putnam and Corey have been feuding over land ownership. Parris is unhappy with his salary and living conditions as minister, and accuses Proctor of heading a conspiracy to oust him from the church. Abigail, standing quietly in a corner, witnesses all of this.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the 1930s through early 1960s, the evening glove was adapted for wear with certain high end {{lounging}} and sleeping outfits, or peignoir sets. Such gloves were typically made out of the same lightweight sheer nylon, rayon, or silk as of the lingerie set in a matching or complementary color and always of above elbow length. These gloves were introduced to bring the fashion for covered hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> protect skin during sleep and leisure time, and provide modesty for women during times of travel, visitation, or shared accommodation. While never widespread, these sleeping gloves were a desired component of the most expensive bedroom ensembles. Given the prevalence of gloves in mid-20th century women's fashion, a woman who added sleeping gloves to her wardrobe would have been gloved virtually at all times.|$|E

He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known {{for five or six}} years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E

500|$|After Wilde {{left the}} court, {{a warrant for}} his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover {{and try to get}} a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, [...] "The train has gone. It's too late." [...] Wilde was arrested for [...] "gross indecency" [...] under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning {{homosexual}} acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas.|$|E

Charla's foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall.

500|$|Despite the {{warnings}} of their intelligence officers, the security chiefs were caught completely by surprise. The RLI headquarters {{and all three}} Commandos were deployed in the Zambezi valley on routine border-control duty, and Support Group was at Cranborne Barracks. A troop of Support Group men under Second Lieutenant Ian Buttenshaw was despatched to Centenary the next day along with a troop of SAS, led by Bert Sachse. In their preliminary sweep around Altena Farm they discovered a land mine planted in the road, but no insurgents. While the security forces were patrolling around Altena, Nhongo's men approached Whistlefield Farm in the late evening of 22 December and, as at Altena, attacked the farm house with rifle fire, grenades and an RPG-7 rocket launcher, which was aimed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> in which de Borchgrave was sleeping. The rocket hit the window frame and lightly wounded the tobacco farmer and his nine-year-old daughter Anne. The ZANLA cadres then retreated and hid themselves. News of the second attack reached Buttenshaw and Sachse around midnight, and they deployed immediately, but having discovered a mine near Altena they disembarked from the vehicles [...] from Whistlefield and made the final approach on foot. Anne was evacuated by helicopter as the RLI and SAS men secured the area for the night.|$|E

Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him.
