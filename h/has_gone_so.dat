The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País.

25|$|Over {{one million}} cases of acute {{salpingitis}} are reported {{every year in}} the US, but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far that it has developed chronic complications. For women age 16–25, salpingitis is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of females of reproductive age.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far {{that we have a}} Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|On release, certain Riesling wines {{reveal a}} {{striking}} petrol note (goût de pétrole in French) which is sometimes described with associations to kerosene, lubricant or rubber. While {{an integral part}} of the aroma profile of mature Riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers, it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it, and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine. The negative attitude to petrol aromas in young Riesling, and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety, seem more common in Germany than in Alsace or on the export market, and some German producers, especially the volume-oriented ones, have even gone so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid, even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging. In that vein, the German Wine Institute <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to omit the mentioning of [...] "petrol" [...] as a possible aroma on their German-language Wine Aroma Wheel, which is supposed to be specially adapted to German wines, and despite the fact that professor Ann C. Noble had included petrol in her original version of the wheel.|$|E

[...] A [...] wicketkeeper {{and more}} than a useful middle order batsman, he was a regular member of the {{national}} team between 1995–2007. [...] Bangladeshi coach Dav Whatmore <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to claim Mashud as the best wicketkeeper in Asia. Khaled was also the wicketkeeper who contributed to Bangladesh's first ever ODI hat-trick by taking two magnificent catches off Shahadat Hossain's bowling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{is important not}} only for the specific point in issue, but it also was one of the earlier cases in relation to the modern development of the English law of restitution in relation to payments made under mistake of fact and the defence of change of position.

2500|$|As minors by law, {{children}} do not have autonomy or {{the right to make}} decisions on their own for themselves in any known jurisdiction of the world. Instead their adult caregivers, including parents, social workers, teachers, youth workers, and others, are vested with that authority, depending on the circumstances. Some believe that this state of affairs gives children insufficient control over their own lives and causes them to be vulnerable. Louis Althusser <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to describe this legal machinery, as it applies to children, as [...] "repressive state apparatuses".|$|E

2500|$|Where Milton differs {{is in the}} use {{of scripture}} as evidence. Milton relies on scripture as the basis of his {{argument}} and keeps scripture {{in the center of his}} text, whereas many other theological treatises keep scriptural passages to the margins. In essence, as Lieb says, [...] "Milton privileges the proof-text over that which is to be proven." [...] Schwartz <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to claim that Milton [...] "ransacked the whole Bible" [...] and that Milton's own words are [...] "squeezed out of his text." [...] However, the actual [...] "proof-texts" [...] of the Bible are various: no single version is used in Milton's Latin citations.|$|E
2500|$|Mutemath has {{resisted}} being {{classified as a}} Christian band, even suing their record label Warner Brothers over being marketed as such. Paul Meany stated {{in an interview in}} 2006 that if his previous band Earthsuit (a Christian act) [...] "inspired anything, it was what not to do." [...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian. While Armistice explored themes of doubt and pessimism that the band <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to call [...] "atheistic," [...] Meany stated that the idea for the album Odd Soul was [...] "loosely based on our upbringing in what I guess you could call eccentric Christianity," [...] and King further explained that they wanted to celebrate [...] "their weird religious roots." [...] Rolling Stone has also noted this connection, calling them [...] "kinda sorta a Christian rock band." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've seen proof, {{black on}} white, that Herr Dr. [...] {{has not yet}} severed his {{connection}} with the anti-Semitic movement...Since then I've had difficulty coming up {{with any of the}} tenderness and protectiveness I've so long felt toward you. The separation between us is thereby decided in really the most absurd way.

2500|$|Thurman {{obtained}} the regular {{role of a}} television producer dating a much younger man on the NBC miniseries The Slap (2015), the American adaptation of the Australian series of the same name. The eight-part project revolves around the fallout after a man slaps another couple's misbehaving child, and each episode is told through {{the perspective of a}} different character. On Thurman's role-centric episode, TV Overmind wrote that it was a [...] "reminder as to why this actress <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far in her career". Also in 2015, she played a famed restaurant critic named Simone in the little-seen drama Burnt, starring Bradley Cooper. Variety described her role as a [...] "two-scene cameo [...] though she’s mainly on hand to set the plot in motion". Thurman next took on the recurring role of a fixer on the Bravo dark comedy series Imposters, which premiered in February 2017.|$|E
2500|$|As their armies deployed, {{the commanders}} would {{have sought to}} motivate their soldiers. Tacitus, who wrote of the battle {{more than fifty years}} later, claims to relate Boudica's speech to her followers: [...] "'But now,' she said, 'it is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged {{chastity}} of my daughters. Roman lust <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far that not our very persons, nor even age or virginity, are left unpolluted. But heaven {{is on the side of}} a righteous vengeance; a legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves in their camp, or are thinking anxiously of flight. They will not sustain even the din and the shout of so many thousands, much less our charge and our blows. If you weigh well the strength of the armies, and the causes of the war, you will see that in this battle you must conquer or die. This is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Cranston {{contributed a}} great deal to the character's persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the {{development}} of the series, the actor wrote his own back story for the character. At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline. He had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as [...] "impotent" [...] and like a [...] "dead caterpillar". Cranston has also repeatedly identified elements in scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his father for how Walt carries himself physically, which he described as [...] "a little hunched over, never erect, [...] {{the weight of the world}} is on this man's shoulders". In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as [...] "a kid trapped in a man's body".|$|E

2500|$|In Mexico, where 6.34% of {{the female}} {{population}} has a child between the age of 15 and 19, {{there are some who}} make a conscious choice against motherhood. For some, becoming a nun offers a way out domesticity, machismo, and a lack of educational opportunity toward a more socially responsible path. Those in orders who see their work as allies of the poor and imbued with a mission for social justice, have increasingly been characterized as feminists and having [...] "a certain secularist mentality". Mexico's nuns who work along the US/Mexico border with migrants experience difficulties trying to balance strict Catholic doctrine against suffering that they see and some believe the church needs to take a more humanitarian approach. [...] Similarly, those, who are working to bring visibility to femicide and halting violence against women, seek [...] "to realize the humanity in all of us regardless of our religious beliefs". An organization called the Rede Latinoamericana de Católicas (Latin American Catholic Network) <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to send a letter to Pope Francis supporting feminism, women's rights to life and health, their quest for social justice and their rights to make their own choices regarding sexuality, reproduction and abortion.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} roles {{performed}} by the militia during the territorial period was social. The prominent military historian, Russell F. Weigley <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to write that [...] "... the volunteer [...] companies were {{at least as much}} a social as a military phenomenon." [...] Residents of Territorial Arkansas spent much of their lives in virtual isolation. Farms were scattered over a huge expanse; roads were few and far between, and towns were small in both number and size. In essence, people were lonely and militia service gave them an opportunity to do something out of the ordinary. Early Arkansans, especially the elite, also had a great affection for military titles. [...] "Colonel" [...] Robert Crittenden was a mere ensign during his military career, and [...] "General" [...] John Harrington had not served in the regular Army at all! [...] John Harrington used the title [...] "Major" [...] which was given to him in the Georgia Militia when he was appointed on 26 Sep 1792 to replace Major Middleton Woods. [...] (Georgia Governors' Journals 1789–1798, Franklin County Page 86). [...] The militia gave status-conscious early Arkansans an easy opportunity to win a military title at very little expense in effort.|$|E
2500|$|He {{had also}} been accused of acting in favour of larger states to secure a desired second term in office. This <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> far as to {{overrule}} Commissioner McCreevy (internal market commissioner) from overhauling artists' levies after pressure from France, despite Barroso himself being an economic liberal. In July 2008 he succeeded in winning the support of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. However he has stated {{it is up to}} the parties in Parliament to decide and that despite his attempts for re-election being well known, he never publicly declared this intention until an interview on 19 July 2008. He further stated he felt honoured and privileged to serve as president. In fact, he did consider resigning as president during the talks on the Treaty of Lisbon, notably due to notorious disagreements between Germany and Poland, but considered to do so would be [...] "too theatrical". In October 2008 he won the informal support of the European People's Party for re-election. The EPP came out as the largest party after the 2009 elections and, after gaining the support of other rightist parties, Barroso won Parliament's support for a second term on 16 September 2009. His team was approved by Parliament in February 2010 after a number of concessions to Parliament.|$|E
