40|$|Objective of {{the work}} could be found out primarily, whether the refraktive a {{foldable}} multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N meets the expectations of patients and Ophthalmologen, like eyesight nearby and distance at far-reaching glasses independence. At the same time, it should be checked how far prejudices are justified conditionally {{by the quality of}} earlier multi-focal lens generations such as a dazzling sensitiveness increased post-operatively and perception of visual phenomena. As a comparison group patients were consulted by the type Allergan SI 40 nb to this with Monofokallinsen. The two models are foldable intraocular back chamber lenses of silicone material breaking highly with PMMA-Haptik, a complete diameter of 13 mm and a visual diameter of 6 mm. The multi-focal lenses of the type ARRAY SA 40 N are refraktive silicone multi-focal lenses. They stand out wavy surface of the visual part due to an asphärische. At first the extraction of the patient data was carried out from the operation register of the eye hospital Berlin-Marzahn of the period of 1997 - 2001. The data of the medical files were been in a recording bend and encoded with answers of the questionnaires in a database. In the questionnaire these became post-operative glasses carrying behaviors, light sensations, dazzling sensitiveness as well as includes subjective patient satisfaction. 34 patients got bilateral and 45 patients a multi-focal lens, 56 patients from the consecutively select patients a Monofokallinse unilaterally. The after-control and follow-up treatment was generally carried out with the set up eye specialists. 7. 2 months after the first implantation found a first later check-up of the clinic instead of, a further with 10 patients (17 eyes) after 4. 14 years in connection with the implantation of the art lens at the partner eye on average. The examination on hand shows that the Visus after implantation of the multi-focal lens Array SA 40 N has improved with almost all patients. At the multi-focal lens patients 66. 07 % on the first post-operative day reached an approaching keenness of sight of Nieden 1 and 58. 7 % a keenness of sight of at least 1. 0 in the distance without an additional correction. The implantation of this multi-focal lens led to a good post-operative unkorrigierten Fernvisus comparably with it of Monofokallinsen. Better results were obtained in the local area as expected as the examination points. The patient interview has shown {{that the majority of the}} patients is satisfied with the operation result. Although light sensations which are found disturbing of most patients as little, however, appear post-operatively. The perception of visual phenomena depends on the objective refraction, the Astigma-tismus, the IOL design, the pupil distance and the patient age. The post-operative increase of the dazzling sensitiveness as well as the perception of visual side-effects are negligible for the patient at corresponding clearing up and it therefore turns out that the prejudices are not justified opposite the multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N unlike the multi-focal lenses of earlier generation. The multi-focal intraocular lens used here increases the quality of the visual rehabilitation of the patients after cataract extraction by reducing the necessity of an additional glasses correction. By the use of foldable intraocular lenses and with that small cut technology the post-operative astigmatism is negligible. The advantages of the multi-focal lenses get noticeable for many patients particularly after a bilateral implantation as ours covers examination. The majority of the multi-focal lens straps uses primarily or reading post-operative glasses at longer approaching work. The far zones of ARRAY SA 40 N can be used by reading-glasses for the proximity; what particularly when reading longer than pleasant is found. The majority of the patients has also more than four year after implantation of the multi-focal lens a good Fern and also Nahvisus without correction. They get by largely without glasses, have a good contrast sensitiveness and feel neither increased dazzling nor visual phenomena strongly impaired. Our case idea and also other publications show that the implantation of multi-focal lenses is possible also with younger patients, particularly children. The careful pre-operative patient selection as well as a detailed patient clearing up also on the part of the introducing and giving further treatment eye specialists are imperative for a good result. The patient should know that despite an ideal bio metric objective, a complete renunciation of glasses cannot be always reached. It a certain degree of tolerance of the dazzling phenomena known, appearing post-operatively should also from the patient and halo as well as the contrast perception reduced be found. Extremely critical patients should be warned against multi-focal lenses under circumstances. To be able to obtain a correct visual effect of the lens, a symmetrical Kapselsackfixation is imperative from the surgeon. Moreover, astigmatism as low as possible and post-operative Emmetropie have to be striven which is reached by the use of foldable MIOL and an exact biometrics. The stake of the IOL Masters has proved itself very much. The foldable multi-focal lens ARRAY SA 40 N used by us here has several focal lengths and provides with a sharp eyesight in a different distance by the fluent transition of 5 refraktiven zones. At the time of the assessment it was the only multi-focal lens with FDA admission. Further operative proceedings for the correction of the presbyopia which partly are in the experimental stage still are akkommodierende intraocular lenses, magnetically movable intraocular lenses or the replacement of the cloudy lens by "Lens refilling". The so-called akkommodativen lenses are not, however, an actual alternative to the multi-focal lens due to the too low accommodation breadth at present. The method of the "Lens refilling" is still immature by the inaccurate precomputation of the lens size, the bend radii and the refracting power. The sum of our results and the literature enquiry show that the multi-focal lens used by us is a good alternative to the Monofokallinse under strict consideration of the selection criteria which contributes to the improvement on the quality of life. The newest generation of multi-focal lenses seems to compensate for the known disadvantages by the additional asphärische surface, the amplified approaching part of+ 4. 0 diopters, the dependence on pupildiameter lenweitenunabhängikeit, the sharp optics <b>edge,</b> <b>flashing</b> blue light filter as well as apodisierung in a certain measure...|$|E

40|$|Responses of parafoveal macaque {{ganglion}} {{cells were}} measured {{as a function}} of the contrast and position of an <b>edge</b> <b>flashed</b> within their receptive fields. The goal was to determine the ability of different cell types to signal edge location. For comparison, parafoveal vernier thresholds of human observers were measured with pairs of <b>flashed</b> <b>edges.</b> Cells of the magnocellular (MC-) pathway gave larger responses than cells of the parvocellular (PC-) pathway. Neurometric analyses comparing a cell's response at different edge positions were performed. The positional signal from single MC-pathway cells was more precise than from PC-pathway cells, especially at lower contrasts. In a second analysis, based on the neurophysiological results, responses from a matrix of ganglion cells were generated. Using a simple model, vernier performance expected from such a matrix was predicted {{as a function of}} edge length and contrast. Again, the MC-pathway gave a more precise positional signal than the PC-pathway despite the latter's numerical advantage. At contrasts of 20 and below, only the MC-pathway would appear capable of supporting vernier performance with our stimuli. At higher contrasts either the MC- or PC-pathway could provide an adequate signal...|$|R

Tons of new features were included in the version, including more integration with Cortana, a dark theme, browser extension support for Microsoft <b>Edge,</b> click-to-play <b>Flash</b> by default, tab pinning, web notifications, swipe navigation in Edge, and the ability for Windows Hello to use a fingerprint sensor to sign into apps and websites, similar to Touch ID on the iPhone. Also added was Windows Ink, which improves digital inking in many apps, and the Windows Ink Workspace which lists pen-compatible apps, as well as quick shortcuts to a sticky notes app and a sketchpad. Microsoft, through their partnership with Canonical, integrated a full Ubuntu bash shell via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Notable tweaks in this version of Windows 10 include the removal of the controversial password-sharing feature of Microsoft's Wi-Fi Sense service, a slightly redesigned Start menu, Tablet Mode working more like Windows 8, overhauled emoji, improvements to the lock screen, calendar integration in the taskbar, and the Blue Screen of Death now showing a QR code which users can scan to quickly find out what caused the error.

40|$|The {{position}} of a moving object is often mislocalised {{in the direction of}} movement. At the input stage of visual processing, the {{position of}} a moving object should still be represented veridically, whereas it should become closer to the mislocalised position at a later processing stage responsible for positional judgment. Here, we show that visual transients expose the veridical {{position of a}} moving object represented in early visual areas. For example, when a ring is flashed on a moving bar, the part of the bar within the ring is perceived at the veridical position, whereas the part outside the ring is perceived to be ahead of the ring as in the flash-lag effect. Our observations suggest that a filling-in process is triggered at the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flash.</b> This indicates that, in early cortical areas, moving objects are still represented at their veridical positions, and the perceived location is determined by the higher visual areas...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel color {{multiplexing}} method for extracting depth edges in a scene. It {{has been shown}} that casting shadows from different light positions provides a simple yet robust cue for extracting depth <b>edges.</b> Instead of <b>flashing</b> a single light source at a time as in conventional methods, our method flashes all light sources simultaneously {{to reduce the number of}} captured images. We use a ring light source around a camera and arrange colors on the ring such that the colors form a hue circle. Because complementary colors are arranged at any position and its antipole on the ring, shadow regions where a half of the hue circle is occluded are colorized according to the orientations of depth edges, while non-shadow regions where all the hues are mixed have a neutral color in the captured image. In an ideal situation, the colored shadows in a single image directly provide depth edges and their orientations. In practice, we present a robust depth edge extraction algorithm using an additional image captured by rotating the hue circle with 180 degrees. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using a camera prototype consisting of a standard camera and 8 color LEDs...|$|R
40|$|I-SC-V-OC curves {{measured}} by the suns-V-OC method are widely used for solar cell characterization due to its being unaffected by series resistance effects. A common setup for this measurement system uses a xenon photoflash for illumination purposes, resulting in a fast acquisition of the suns-V-OC measurement data during the decaying <b>edge</b> of one <b>flash.</b> However, {{the use of a}} xenon photoflash accompanies also several disadvantages. Measurement errors are expected from the imperfect illumination homogeneity on the measurement stage. Also the discrepancy of the flash spectrum compared to the standard AM 1. 5 G spectrum leads to spectral mismatch between the sample and monitor cells when their spectral response differs. In addition, the divergence of the flash light leads to different illumination densities on the sample and the monitor cell if the height of these two cells differs. In this article these photoflash-caused measurement errors are investigated in detail, analyzing the resulting deviation in illumination density. The error due to an inhomogeneous illumination is negligible under most circumstances, while the error due to a spectral mismatch has to be considered but can be reduced drastically if an additional short-pass filter is used. The measurement error due to different cell highs should be taken into account but can be accounted for using an analytical correction...|$|R
40|$|Flash/noflash pairs {{have been}} used for noise-reduction in ambient-light images. But not {{explicitly}} studied is the problem of shadows in the ambient images. While shadows are lessened in a flash image, other problems arise, and other shadows are produced. It is known that we can in fact produce a flash-only (no ambient) image by subtracting the two images, but the result is not as pleasant as the ambient image, because of several artifacts due to the flash. Here, we use the pure-flash image to detect the ambient shadows. We argue that first going to a “spectrally sharpened” color space, and then focusing on the difference in a log domain of the flash image minus the ambient image, gives a very simple feature space consisting of two components — one in an illuminant-change 3 -vector direction, and one along the gray axis. This space provides excellent separation of the shadow and nonshadow areas. Inserting <b>edges</b> from the <b>flash</b> image within the ambient-shadow region into the ambient image edge map and inverting Poisson’s equation fills in the shadow. In this way, we arrive at an image with the advantages of the ambient-only image — warmth, no flash effects such as disturbing illumination dropoff with distance, pixel saturation etc. — but no shadows. 1...|$|R
50|$|The rifle's compact dimensions, {{compared}} to the AKS-74, were achieved by using a short 206.5 mm barrel (this forced designers to simultaneously reduce the gas piston operating rod to an appropriate length). Due to the shortening of the operating mechanism the cyclic rate of fire rose slightly to around 700-735 rounds per minute. In order to effectively stabilize projectiles, the barrel's twist rate was increased from 200 mm (1:7.87 in) to 160 mm (1:6.3 in) to adapt the AKS-74U for muzzle velocities of 720 m/s and higher. A new gas block was installed at the muzzle end of the barrel with a muzzle booster, which features an internal expansion chamber inside the cylindrical section of the booster while the conical end acts as a nozzle to increase net pressure inside the gas chamber by supplying an increased amount of propellant gasses from the barrel. The chrome-lined muzzle booster also burns any remaining propellant, which would normally reduce muzzle blast. However, due to the extremely short barrel and conical end of the booster, the muzzle blast is nevertheless extremely large and visible. The muzzle device locks into the gas block with a spring-loaded detent pin and features two parallel notches cut into the <b>edge</b> of the <b>flash</b> hider cone, used for unscrewing it using the cleaning rod stored under the barrel. The forward sling loop was relocated {{to the left side}} of the carbine and the front sight was integrated into the gas block.|$|R
40|$|Flash/noflash pairs {{have been}} studied as a simple {{mechanism}} for supplying less-noisy information for dark areas of an ambient-light image. This research direction also includes image pairs or sequences of nighttime or obscured imagery such as surveillance video. Ambient imagery has some advantages over flash images, in general, in that a flash can create harsh or unpleasing effects, and can also generate additional shadowing. The extra shadows from the flash are in fact quite amenable to detection. However, filling in information in image areas occupied by shadows in the ambient image has not been effectively considered. Here we consider the problem of detecting shadows in the image taken under ambient light, given extra information from a flash image registered with the first. Clearly, the pure-flash image {{is the difference between}} the two — and has no ambient-shadow component. But the question of how best to detect the ambient shadow remains. We argue that first going to a “spectrally sharpened ” color space, and then focusing on the difference in a log domain of the flash image and the ambient image, gives a very simple feature space consisting of two components — one in an illuminant-change 3 -vector direction, and one along the gray axis. This space provides excellent separation of the shadow and nonshadow areas. Regressing pixel data from the flash image to the nonflash one adjusts the scale properly, and then inserting <b>edges</b> from the <b>flash</b> image inside the ambient-shadow region into the ambient image edge map and inverting Poisson’s equation fills in the shadow.

60|$|Reflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To {{attract the}} notice of a {{division}} of your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass in the sun, throwing its flash towards where {{you expect them to}} be. It is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is. It is now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer; therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical angle is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a flash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible. That area is the section of the fasciculus of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have supposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror; but as he retreats from the object, the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flash</b> become rounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short, look just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will proceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object. The steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more nor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle.|$|R
