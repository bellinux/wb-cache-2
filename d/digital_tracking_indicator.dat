40|$|We {{describe}} <b>digital</b> <b>tracking,</b> {{a method}} for asteroid searches that greatly increases the sensitivity of a telescope to faint unknown asteroids. It has been previously used to detect faint Kuiper Belt objects using the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based instruments, and to find a small, fast-moving asteroid during a close approach to Earth. We complement this earlier work by developing <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology for detecting asteroids using large-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the ground-based detection {{of large numbers of}} new faint asteroids. Our methodology resolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that for both asteroid populations, <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> can deliver a factor of ten improvement over conventional searches. <b>Digital</b> <b>tracking</b> has long been standard practice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables deeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt asteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0. 9 m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak validates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime previously probed only with 4 -meter and larger instruments, and leads to the detection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single field. <b>Digital</b> <b>tracking</b> has the potential to revolutionize searches for faint moving objects ranging from the Kuiper Belt through main belt and near-Earth asteroids, and perhaps even anthropogenic space debris in low Earth orbit.
