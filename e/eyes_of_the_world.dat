5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin in the <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

25|$|In Bayonetta 2, a {{few months}} after the events of the first game, Bayonetta and Jeanne are {{fighting}} an outbreak of angels when a supernatural summoning goes wrong and Jeanne is killed by Gomorrah. Bayonetta then sets out to rescue Jeanne's soul from a realm called Hell, heading to the sacred mountain of Fimbulvintr to find the doorway to Inferno. Arriving at the town of Noatun, she encounters a mysterious boy named Loki who serves as her guide to the mountain. She also reunites with Luka, who tells her about the legend of the deity Aesir, who created and ruled the human realm. During their journey, the pair is attacked by a masked Lumen Sage who targets Loki. When they reach the Gates of Hell, Bayonetta meets, Loptr, who is apparently working with the Masked Lumen and knows Loki very well. Through a vision, he reveals to her that her father Balder was not responsible for the witch hunts and he tried to save her mother. But Rosa was killed by an unknown assailant who looks like Loki. To escape their attackers, Bayonetta and Loki flee into Hell but the Masked Lumen follows them. Separated from the boy, Bayonetta fights through hordes of demons and successfully rescues Jeanne's soul. However, she finds Loki being attacked again by the Masked Lumen. Intervening, Bayonetta fights the Sage, who is revealed to be her father Balder at a young age. Balder had been targeting Loki for Rosa's murder. Suddenly, Loki unwillingly sends both Bayonetta and Balder back into the past during the Witch Hunts. Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two of them fight against the angels. During the battle, she fights a younger version of Loptr, and she realizes that he was Rosa's murderer and framed Loki for the crime. Later encountering Balder, the pair enter the Umbran Witch sanctuary to find that Loptr had killed Rosa. When he escapes, Bayonetta tells Balder that the killer was not Loki. She then opens a time portal and the two of them return to the present. With the help of Jeanne flying a fighter jet, Bayonetta and Balder set out for Fimbulvientr to confront Loptr, who has captured Loki. He reveals that he and Loki are the two halves of Aesir. When Aesir divided his power into the <b>Eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> he split his soul into two: Loki being the good half and Loptr being the evil half. But Loptr decided to take back his power and become Aesir once again. Draining Loki of his power, Loptr takes the Eyes from both Bayonetta and Balder and transforms into Aesir. While the Witch and the Sage team up to fight Aesir, Loki uses his hidden power to erase the Eyes and weaken Loptr. Bayonetta and Balder defeat Loptr and split his soul from his body. When he tries to escape into the past to be reborn, Balder stops him by sealing the soul inside his body, despite Loki warning that it will corrupt him. Bayonetta tearfully bids farewell to her father as he is transported back into the past and becomes the corrupted Father Balder. As Loki begins to fade, he promises to Bayonetta that they will meet again when he is reborn.|$|E
