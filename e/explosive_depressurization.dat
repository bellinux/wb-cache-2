5000|$|On October 18, 1985, a Jordanian Airlines L-1011 {{experienced}} an inflight fire at 24,000 feet while on approach to Singapore. The fire burned {{through the rear}} pressure bulkhead, causing <b>explosive</b> <b>depressurization</b> of the cabin. The air rushing out of the cabin extinguished the fire, saving the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Doctor Crusher and Lieutenant Commander La Forge {{are in a}} {{cargo bay}} {{examining}} a recent supply of thruster fuel. When the disaster strikes, they are trapped in the bay, and find that a plasma fire has erupted in a nearby panel; {{it is not only}} letting off potentially lethal radiation affecting them, but also destabilizing the fuel, risking an explosion. They {{come up with a plan}} to depressurize the bay, not only dousing the fire due to lack of oxygen, but also removing the fuel during the <b>explosive</b> <b>depressurization.</b> They safely hold on during this process and eventually reseal the bay with fresh air.|$|E
40|$|Limit {{equilibrium}} {{analyses were}} applied to the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1956 Bezymianny failures {{in order to examine}} the influence on stability of structural deformation produced by cryptodome emplacement. Weakening structures associated with the cryptodome include outward-dipping normal faults bounding a summit graben and a flat shear zone {{at the base of the}} bulged flank generated by lateral push of the magma. Together with the head of the magmatic body itself, these structures serve directly to localize failure along a critical surface with low stability deep within the interior of the edifice. This critical surface, with the safety coefficient reduced by 25 – 30 %, is then very sensitive to stability condition variation, in particular to the pore-pressure ratio (ru) and seismicity coefficient (n). For ru= 0. 3, or n= 0. 2, the deep surface suffers catastrophic failure, removing a large volume of the edifice flank. In the case of Mount St. Helens, failure occurred within a material with angle of friction ~ 40 °, cohesion in the range 105 – 106 Pa, and probably significant water pore pressure. On 18 May 1980, detachment of slide block I occurred along a newly formed rupture surface passing through the crest of the bulge. Although sliding of block I may have been helped by the basal shear zone, significant pore pressure and a triggering earthquake were required (ru= 0. 3 and n= 0. 2). Detachment of the second block was guided by the summit normal fault, the front of the cryptodome, and the basal shear zone. This occurred along a deep critical surface, which was on the verge of failure even before the 18 May 1980 earthquake. The stability of equivalent surfaces at Bezymianny Volcano appears significantly higher. Thus, although magma had already reached the surface, weaker materials, or higher pore pressure and/or seismic conditions were probably required to reach the rupture threshold. From our analysis, we find that deep-seated sector collapses formed by removing the edifice summit cannot generally result from a single slide. Cryptodome-induced deformation does, however, provide a deep potential slip surface. As previously thought, it may assist deep-seated sector collapse because it favors multiple retrogressive slides. This leads to <b>explosive</b> <b>depressurization</b> of the magmatic and hydrothermal systems, which undermines the edifice summit and produces secondary collapses and explosive blasts...|$|E
5000|$|Rogers also {{starred in}} several other movies. In 1981 he {{played the role of}} an art forger in Roger Vadim's The Hot Touch. Then, in the movie The Gig (1985), {{alongside}} Cleavon Little, as a jazz musician-hobbyist whose group has an opportunity to play a Catskills resort and must confront failure. Also in 1985, he starred opposite Barbara Eden in the televised reunion movie I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later based on the 1960s situation comedy I Dream of Jeannie. Rogers took on the role of Major Tony Nelson which was originally portrayed by Larry Hagman in the television series when Hagman was unavailable to reprise the character he had originated. In 1986, Rogers hosted the short-lived CBS television series High Risk. He also starred as Walter Duncan in the 1987 movie Race Against the Harvest.In 1990 Rogers co-starred with Connie Selleca in the CBS made-for-television movie [...] "Miracle Landing" [...] based on the true story of the 1988 Aloha Airlines Flight 243 crash landing after an <b>explosive</b> cabin <b>depressurization.</b>|$|R
