5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds <b>from</b> <b>east</b> <b>to</b> west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched <b>from</b> <b>east</b> <b>to</b> west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
