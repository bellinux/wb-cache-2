Gabriel Camps has suggested that a link to Sicily. He has made the same suggestion for the “haouanet” tombs found in Algeria and Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|Beside {{the danger}} of people {{receiving}} burns from the fire or embers, campfires may spread into a larger fire. A campfire may burn {{out of control in}} two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. If a root, particularly a dead one, is exposed to fire, it may smoulder underground and ignite the parent tree long after the original fire is doused and the campers have left the area. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch is extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces {{about the size of the}} nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know it will be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E

500|$|Lady of the Forest has {{received}} generally positive reviews, with Stephen Knight deeming it a [...] "highly effective novel."

In Spices, Salt and Aromatics David writes about the {{background}} of the herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. The Times Literary Supplement called this part of the book [...] "as <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down as a good thriller." [...] David follows a similar path in English Bread and Yeast Cookery; reviewing the book Hilary Spurling wrote that it contained [...] "a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns".

He said that the only reason why the episode was given a score as high as two was because of the effectiveness of the scene with Miles and Keiko.|$|E
500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more remarkable is that they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> some of them upon a gallop."

500|$|During the Battle of Tsushima, Knyaz Suvorov was {{the lead}} ship in the Russian battle line and she opened fire at the , {{flagship}} of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō at 14:05. Mikasa began to return fire about five minutes later, joined by the battleship [...] and the armored cruiser [...] The battleship [...] joined the others firing at Knyaz Suvorov around 14:20, which had been set on fire by hits from the other ships. At 14:35, Rozhestvensky and the ship's captain were wounded by splinters that entered the conning tower. Shortly afterwards, Rozhestvensky was knocked unconscious by a splinter in the skull and flames made the conning tower untenable so that the ship had to be steered from her auxiliary control position. Around 14:52, another hit jammed the steering gear after a four point turn to starboard had been ordered and caused the ship make nearly a full circle before she could be steered by her engines. Splinters from numerous shell hits shredded water hoses and made it much more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the numerous fires out. By this time Knyaz Suvorovs aft 12-inch gun turret had been destroyed by an explosion that blew its roof off onto the quarterdeck, her forward funnel had fallen down and her mainmast had been shot away.|$|E

The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

On 24 May Abbott {{formally}} took up his position, attending the House of Lords regularly, and was the last Chief Justice to wear his official robes to the Lords (other than those acting as interim Speakers). In 1830 he introduced several bills to Parliament following reports {{on the state of the}} Ecclesiastical Courts, common law courts and law of real property; all were passed, except the ecclesiastical bills, as Parliament ran out of time to hear them.

The Reform Act 1832 led to his departure from the Lords, and is considered to have greatly shortened his life; he fought strongly for the city corporations, which he claimed the bill treated [...] "with absolute contempt", but would be defeated. Having threatened that, should it pass, [...] "Never, never my Lords, shall I enter the doors of this House", he was true to his word, and never returned to politics, although from 8 August to 3 September 1827 he was interim Chancellor of the Exchequer, following the convention that, when vacant, the position should be held by the Lord Chief Justice.|$|E
