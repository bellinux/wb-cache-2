Borehole instability and reservoir damage had become the international technical problems of petroleum exploration and development of complicated area, and the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir was {{the main cause of}} borehole instability and reservoir damage. In order to prevent the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir, domestic and foreign scholars recently put forward the technology of ultra-low permeable drilling fluid. <b>Film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agent</b> was the key treating agent of ultra-low permeable drilling fluid, the <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agent</b> (HN- 1) was developed, which did not affect properties of the drilling fluid and could decrease the filter loss of drilling fluid applied in Enping 24 - 2 oil field.

40|$|The {{addition}} of enalapril maleate to a casting solution for orodispersible films (ODFs) containing hypromellose and carbomer 974 P as <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agents</b> (standard casting solution, SCS) caused a dose dependent {{reduction of the}} viscosity. This phenomenon was a serious problem {{in the preparation of}} ODFs with an increased enalapril load (> 1 mg per ODF) when using the solvent casting method. The aim of the present work was twofold. Firstly, the influence of enalapril on the viscosity of SCS was studied in more detail. Secondly, two methods for increasing the enalapril load of an ODF were investigated that did not negatively influence the properties of SCS. The casting height was increased and the preparation of bilayered ODF, using the double-casting method, was explored. In the framework of the bilayered ODFs the compatibility between the <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agents</b> hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), sodium alginate (SA), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and the combination hypromellose-carbomer 974 P (SCS) was investigated. Results and conclusions: We found that enalapril concentration dependently reduced the pH, thereby negatively influencing the gel formation and the viscosity of SCS. An increased casting height did not result in a proportionally increased enalapril load. The enalapril load could be doubled when a bilayered ODF containing two layers of SCS was produced. Finally, not all combinations of <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agents</b> could be used for the preparation of bilayered ODFs. Besides, the sequence in which the different polymer layers were casted affected the appearance of the ODFs.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the physicochemical properties and antimicrobial activity of shellac/ 2 -isopropyl- 5 -methylphenol composite film patch. 2 SHL was applied as a matrix <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>agent</b> for antimicrobial film patch. The samples of IPMP loaded within SHL were prepared in a free film by the casting method. The SHL/IPMP composite film patch was characterized on the physicochemical properties such as: FTIR spectroscopy,X-ray diffraction and mechanical properties. Antimicrobial property was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. The results demonstrated that all films were easily prepared. However, the mechanical properties, XRD and FT-IR of composite film patch were dependent on the composition of blending film while the melting and solubility of film showed no change. The % elongation of the films was increased as the fraction of IPMP increased to 20 %, resulting in more flexibility of shellac. The composite film could be formed by the hydrogen bonds, giving the change in physicochemical properties of films. These results were supported by the change in FT-IR and XRD pattern of composite film. The SHL/IPMP composite films exhibited the inhibition zone at 5 % concentration of IPMP or more concentration. The diameter of inhibition zone was increased as increasing the percentage of IPMP. The result suggested that antimicrobial SHL/IPMP composite film patch could be achieved.

Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and cellulose acetate (CA) are examples of polymers which either have or are being considered for film coating applications {{in the form of}} aqueous dispersions. This study was undertaken to determine the aqueous stability of these polymers to ester hydrolysis. ^ The stability of CA suspensions to ester hydrolysis was examined over the pH range of 2. 15 to 10. 0. Regions of maximal and minimal stability were identified, and the pH at which the rate of hydrolysis was minimal was calculated. The effect of the degree of substitution on polymer stability was determined by comparing the rates of hydrolysis for CA suspensions of 32. 0, 39. 8 and 43. 6 % acetyl content. ^ The stability of the acetyl and phthalyl ester of CAP to hydrolysis was determined over the pH range of 2. 2 to 10. 0. Using pseudo-first order rate constants, a pH-rate profile was constructed for each ester. The profile for acetyl hydrolysis was very similar to that observed for CA. Phthalate hydrolysis proved to be a much more complex process, involving intramolecular catalysis. The activation energies for the hydrolysis of each ester moiety was calculated. ^ The rates of phthalyl and/or acetyl ester hydrolysis were determined for CAP and CA powder and film samples. The samples were stored under various conditions of temperature and relative humidity. Acetyl hydrolysis was much greater for CA film than powder samples. The rate of acetyl hydrolysis was greater than that for phthalyl loss for CAP powder samples. Activation energies were calculated, verifying these observations.

The dissolution behaviour of the anodic <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C can be understood in terms of the extent of sulphate ion adsorption, apparently greater under the same conditions for the former type, and its effect on rate of transfer of protons, hydroxyl ions and water across the oxide/solution interface. A reaction scheme, proposed earlier to account for the behaviour during dissolution of the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid, appears adequate to explain the dissolution behaviour observed in the present studies. However, the type of behaviour, although rather similar for both' anodic non-porous and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C, was quite different from the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} of free-standing anodic alumina films {{obtained from the}} one-sided anodization of aluminum are discussed. The <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum were shown to have maximum flexural strength. Even {{a small amount of}} impurities decreases the flexural strength of the resulting free-standing anodic alumina films to be associated with their higher defectiveness. The microhardness of thick and thin films of anodic alumina is discussed as well. The microhardness of the free-standing porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of low binary alloys of aluminum is shown to be lower than one of <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum...|$|R

40|$|Issues with nickel {{agglomeration}} {{and reduced}} porosity of SOFC anode tubes {{have been noted}} in previous investigations using carbon black as a porosity <b>forming</b> <b>agent,</b> this thesis looks at methods of improving these issues by investigation of alternative materials (carbon, graphite, flour) along with alternative processing methods. The porosity <b>forming</b> <b>agent</b> of the SOFC anode was investigated to establish the most effective material to improve nickel dispersion. The effect of powder processing by milling to improve mixing and particle size distribution within the anode mixture before extrusion and sintering was also investigated. Powder processing by means of milling was seen to offer significant improvements in dispersion of nickel {{over the surface of}} tubes, along with a distinct improvement in the porosity of the sintered tubes. Of the three porosity <b>forming</b> <b>agents</b> investigated wheat flour offered the best solution to the issues of nickel dispersion and increasing tube porosity, it was also found to be the easiest material to process and form into tubes...|$|R
