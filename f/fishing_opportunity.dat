This study assesses the consequences, causes, and potential solutions to the discard problem using the example of North Sea fisheries. Fishermen's immediate objectives during fishing operations and the low confidence in projected gains from discard reduction measures have promoted use of unselective trawls while the poor enforcement of the quota system has exacerbated discard quantities. It is concluded that a reduction in discard rates is required for a long-term solution to the ecological and economic costs of discarding and the development of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> incentives can promote the use of more selective fishing techniques.

40|$|A creel {{survey was}} {{conducted}} at the Keystone stilling basin to determine differences in pressure, harvest, and species composition between hydropower generation discharge and non-discharge periods. Pressure during discharge was 1. 7 times greater than during non-discharge. Total harvest during generation discharge was 1. 8 times that of non-discharge and was dominated by striped bass. Striped bass harvest rate was 3 times greater during discharge. During non-discharge, white bass, channel catfish, and blue catfish became important species in the harvest. No patterns of white or striped bass harvest were observed within generation discharge or non-discharge periods.

40|$|Overview: A {{pilot program}} will be tested on {{selected}} waters in the 18 county, early-opening day zone. This pilot {{will serve as a}} test of providing a one-day <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> for mentored youth, prior to the traditional opening day of trout season in this region. Rationale: Mentored youth hunting programs and special youth hunts have been instituted across the U. S. in recent years in an effort to stem the decline in license sales. These special hunts allow youth to harvest everything from squirrels and ducks to trophy bucks in advance of the general opener. The Pennsylvania Game Commission established early youth opening days or hunts in the mid-to-late 1990 ’s. Most often, parents are the source of both instruction and serve as mentors to young anglers and hunters. It’s this premise on which youth hunts and mentored hunting programs are based (DJ Case &...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity can {{dampen the}} effects of {{ecosystem}} variability through diversification of portfolio assets providing the environmental stability that supports economies and cultures. We examined how elements of salmon biodiversity affect interannual catch stability and within-year season length (opportunity) of First Nations fisheries in the Fraser River watershed from 1983 to 2012 across 5 different species of salmon. Stability and opportunity increased in fisheries with access to increasing richness, as fisheries were closer to the ocean, in mainstem fisheries relative to tributary fisheries, and in fisheries downstream of a partial barrier. The importance of different elements of salmon biodiversity on catch stability varied by species. Richness was the most ubiquitous explanatory variable of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> across all species.

40|$|Abstract only. Like many global pelagic fisheries, the Hawaii-based {{longline}} fishery {{continues to}} face increased pressure {{to reduce the}} incidental catch of endangered sea turtles and/or other sensitive species. Aggregation and movement of both sea turtles and fish are directly associated with climatic variations and oceanographic conditions. As a result, both targeted species and incidental catch rates vary spatially and temporally. Accordingly, successful policy designs of fishery management in terms of effectiveness in turtle avoidance and commercial viability need to consider and adopt the spatial and temporal variations of oceanographic and climate conditions. A spatial bio-economic model was developed to incorporate sea surface temperature (SST), lunar phase, and other variables with temporal and spatial variations. Through the application of this model, this study explores the trade-offs between turtle interaction reduction and the economic return in the Hawaii-based swordfish fishery {{in relation to the}} climate variation and fishing behavior changes. Hence, the model can be used to evaluate impacts of management choices on <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> and sea turtle interaction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sportfishing in {{the eastern}} Lake Ontario area is the {{foundation}} of the coastal heritage of local residents, promotes the awareness of residents about the importance of coastal resources, and is essential to the area’s economic base. With declines projected in sportfishing participation by 18 - to 44 -year-old anglers in New York State by 2005, understanding how constraints influence fishing participation could be essential for maintaining existing participation levels. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify, through qualitative research methods, the major constraints influencing fishing participation by females and males during childhood, adolescence, and early to middle adulthood. Forty-one anglers (i. e., 20 females and 21 males) and 16 non-anglers (i. e., 10 females and 6 males) were interviewed. Constraints varied by life stage, with <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> constraints limiting participation during childhood, social constraints affecting adolescence, and time constraints limiting participation during adulthood. Female interviewees tended to have more constraints on their fishing involvement throughout the course of their lives than did male interviewees. Management implications related to the constraints identified are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of fishing {{behavior}} is choosing where to fish. Trawl skippers usually choose between known fishing opportunities, which are observed as groups of trawls that are conducted in the same portion of a fishing ground, or go exploratory fishing. We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (fishing opportunities) using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. Fishing opportunities were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard deviation 16, range 2 69) of fishing opportunities. Within each <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method {{could also be used}} to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. Fishing opportunities could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Aboriginal and nonaboriginal fishing-dependent {{communities}} {{on the coast}} of British Columbia, Canada, having lost traditional fisheries management institutions along with significant <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> {{are in the process of}} rebuilding local and regional institutions to allow their survival. Sometimes, the rebuilding effort involves the creation of largely new institutions. It can also involve the reactivation, reinvention, or repositioning of older ones. We consider the aspirations, strategies, and activities of organizations in two regions of the coast involved in two different fisheries: salmon on the north coast and intertidal clams in the Broughton Archipelago. We analyze what the two regions have in common, as well as their differences, to generate general predictions and recommendations about what preconditions appear to be necessary for success in rebuilding institutions in communities and regions at these scales and what actions are likely to be most effective, according to a body of literature on self-management and comanagement. In both cases, we found favorable conditions in the communities, the external political arena, and in government to support the rebuilding goals of the organizations working in the two regions. Although both areas would benefit from greater financial resources, the most critical need is for external support in the form of alliances, issue networks, and access to multiple sources of power...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of fisheries is often compromised by management delaying implementation of regulations that reduce harvest, {{in order to}} maintain higher catches in the short term. Decreases or increases in fish population growth rate driven by environmental change, including ecosystem and climate change, affect the harvest that can be taken sustainably. If not acted on rapidly, environmental change could result in unsustainable fishing or missed opportunity for higher catches. Using simulation models of harvested fish populations influenced by environmental change, we explore how long fisheries managers can afford to wait before changing harvest regulations in response to changes in population growth. If environmental change causes population declines, delays greater than five years increase the probability of population collapse. Species with fast and highly variable population growth rates are more susceptible to collapse under delays and should be a priority for revised management where delays occur. Generally, the long-term cost of delay, in terms of lost <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity,</b> exceeds the short-term benefits of overfishing. Lowering harvest limits and monitoring for environmental change can alleviate the impact of delays; however, these measures may be more costly than reducing delays. We recommend that management systems that allow rapid responses to population growth changes be enacted for fisheries management to adapt to ecosystem and climate change...|$|E
40|$|In the {{recently}} proposed real-time incentives (RTI) fisheries management approach fishers would be allocated fishing-impact credits ('RTIs') to spend according to spatiotemporally varying tariffs. RTI-quota and tariffs {{would be based}} on commercial stock targets, and tariffs could be updated based on real-time CPUE data. The fisher could dynamically choose how to spend his RTIs, e. g. by limited fishing in sensitive areas and fishing longer in less sensitive areas. Using a conceptual simulation framework we explore the feasibility of RTI-management given potential responses by fishermen and {{have a look at the}} internal dynamics of the system. In particular, we consider various tactical decision-making strategies that may be used by fishermen to optimise their fishing activities within the system. In addition, we explore RTI-management in the context of the classical mixed-fisheries problem, where restricting fishing mortality of a vulnerable "choke" species could unnecessarily restrict fishing on other species. We find that the adaptive management explicit in the RTI-system can, in principle, cope with various forms of tactical fisher behaviour, even misreporting, and that the system responds in a coherent and understandable way. We show that RTI-management can, in principle, to a large extent overcome the classical mixed-fisheries problem, since the fishing mortality of a "choke" species can be controlled while simultaneously allowing <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> for other species. We discuss our findings as a first step of explorations needed towards testing the RTI-system in the context of its practical implementation. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Lake McConaughy is an {{important}} fishery resource {{of the state of}} Nebraska. The estimated fishing pressure in 1975 as determined from a postal creel census was 175, 872 angler days (Morris 1977). This estimate is inflated compared to an on-site creel census conducted in 1977 - 78 which showed a total of 69, 500 fishing trips annually (Madsen 1980). Not all fishermen were contacted so this estimate is undoubtedly too low. Regardless of which figure is accepted, the reservoir provides many man-days of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Conservation and management of the fishery resource is necessary to maintain and/or improve its quality, An important factor in the management of any fishery resource is the limnological characteristics of the water body, This knowledge is a necessity when coldwater species are part of the fishery. Considerable data have been collected on the limnology of Lake McConaughy (Kiener 1951; McCarraher et al. 1971). Prior to 1969 much of the data were temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles at a limited number of locations on the reservoir. After 1969 some additional data were collected but never thoroughly analyzed or published (Van Velson 1978; Morris 1976), As the result of a project designed to develop a model of the eutrophication process in Lake McConaughy (Taylor 1979), a considerable amount of physicochemical data were collected from 1976 through 1978.

40|$|Extended abstract. In July 2011 the European Commission {{acknowledged}} that "Our current {{system is not}} working in favour of sustainability. Too many fleet segments live on low profits, depend on subsidies for survival. 'Business as usual' is not an option". Indeed, the reform of the policy "must not be yet another piecemeal, incremental reform but a "sea change" cutting to the core reasons behind the vicious circle in which Europe’s fisheries have been trapped in recent decades. ” (Green Paper on Reform of the CFP, April 2009.) The reform package for a new policy is comprehensive and touches upon all aspects of fisheries management, and ongoing negotiations should lead a new policy being implemented in 2013. This paper focuses on the reform of fleet (access) component of the policy. The Commission has proposed a system of transferable fishing concessions, or user rights, for all large scale vessels (> 12 m). The concessions will be distributed by each Member State, and will grant their owner {{a share of the}} national <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> for each year. Operators will be able to lease or trade their concessions nationally, not between Member States, and will have a minimum validity of 15 years. More lenient capacity rules will apply to these vessels. In parallel, the new Maritime and Fisheries Fund 2014 - 2020 will discontinue the use of publicly financed vessel decommissioning, following decades of ineffectiveness. This paper offers a personal analysis of whether a "sea change" reform can be achieved, in promoting market based solutions to solve the overcapacity problem...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are {{the cornerstone of}} most marine conservation strategies, but the effectiveness of each one partly depends on its size and distance to other MPAs in a network. Despite this, current recommendations on ideal MPA size and spacing vary widely, and data are lacking on how these constraints might influence the overall spatial characteristics, socio-economic impacts, and connectivity of the resultant MPA networks. To address this problem, we tested the impact of applying different MPA size constraints in English waters. We used the Marxan spatial prioritization software to identify a network of MPAs that met conservation feature targets, whilst minimizing impacts on fisheries; modified the Marxan outputs with the MinPatch software to ensure each MPA met a minimum size; and used existing data on the dispersal distances {{of a range of}} species found in English waters to investigate the likely impacts of such spatial constraints on the region's biodiversity. Increasing MPA size had little effect on total network area or the location of priority areas, but as MPA size increased, <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> cost to stakeholders increased. In addition, as MPA size increased, the number of closely connected sets of MPAs in networks and the average distance between neighboring MPAs decreased, which consequently increased the proportion of the planning region that was isolated from all MPAs. These results suggest networks containing large MPAs would be more viable {{for the majority of the}} region's species that have small dispersal distances, but dispersal between MPA sets and spill-over of individuals into un{{protected areas}} would be reduced. These findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of applying different MPA size constraints because there are clear trade-offs that result from the interaction of size, number, and distribution of MPAs in a network...|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{different}} types of conservation zones is becoming commonplace. However, spatial prioritization methods that can accommodate multiple zones are poorly understood in theory and application. It is typically assumed that management regulations across zones have differential levels of effectiveness ("zone effectiveness") for biodiversity protection, but the influence of zone effectiveness on achieving conservation targets {{has not yet been}} explored. Here, we consider the zone effectiveness of three zones: permanent closure, partial protection, and open, for planning for the protection of five different marine habitats in the Vatu-i-Ra Seascape, Fiji. We explore the impact of differential zone effectiveness on the location and costs of conservation priorities. We assume that permanent closure zones are fully effective at protecting all habitats, open zones do not contribute towards the conservation targets and partial protection zones lie between these two extremes. We use four different estimates for zone effectiveness and three different estimates for zone cost of the partial protection zone. To enhance the practical utility of the approach, we also explore how much of each traditional fishing ground can remain open for fishing while still achieving conservation targets. Our results show that all of the high priority areas for permanent closure zones would not be a high priority when the zone effectiveness of the partial protection zone is equal to that of permanent closure zones. When differential zone effectiveness and costs are considered, the resulting marine protected area network consequently increases in size, with more area allocated to permanent closure zones to meet conservation targets. By distributing the loss of <b>fishing</b> <b>opportunity</b> equitably among local communities, we find that 84 - 88 % of each traditional fishing ground can be left open while still meeting conservation targets. Finally, we summarize the steps for developing marine zoning that accounts for zone effectiveness...|$|E
