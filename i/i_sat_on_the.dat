25|$|On Sunday afternoons {{when we went}} {{calling on}} the older {{generation}} of relatives, {{those who had been}} active in the Sixties, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of a}} feed box, a form darkened the doorway, and Farmer Decker appeared.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{side of my}} bed, {{actually}} quivering with excitement.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foot of {{the couch}} near to the font-like basin of water, and She sank down softly <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> other end.|$|R
60|$|The kind frank way {{in which}} this was said quite won my heart, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} bed, waiting. In {{less than}} ten minutes the {{telephone}} bell rang again. Once more I heard Ashley's voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "'There {{is but one}} moepuu,' {{said the}} priest Eoppo, looking at me where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coffin {{in the bottom of}} the canoe. Already the chiefs were {{paddling}} out through the reef.|$|E
60|$|Spears led {{the silent}} players {{out of the}} {{dressing}} room and I followed; and while they began to toss balls to and fro, to limber up cold, dead arms, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{after the}} fashion of a scribe, having no choice, and <b>the</b> Princess <b>sat</b> herself <b>on</b> a couch {{at the end of}} the table, but Seti {{remained}} standing. Then the Princess said: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{side of my}} bed. The {{dawn was}} just {{beginning}} to break up the featureless blackness of the small hours. [...] "This is just some odd corner of my brain," [...] I said....|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sofa and}} {{finished}} {{the story of the}} Sicilian lovers.|$|R
60|$|At dusk {{that evening}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back door-step, by the orchard, {{cleaning}} his rifle. The sound of steps {{came from the}} little passage behind me, and a hand was on my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have two--Tuan; {{but it is}} a {{long time}} since <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ladder of a house to talk at ease with neighbours. Yes. Two households; one in--" [...] Lingard smiled faintly. [...] "Tuan, let me follow you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stump of a tree, {{and buried}} {{my face in}} my hands. I must have fallen asleep, for, when I raised my eyes again, the day was brighter. Its cheerlessness had gone. The sky was blue, and birds were singing.|$|E
60|$|A rabbit came {{bounding}} {{across the}} hill {{between us and}} the house. I threw down my suit-case and pursued it hotfoot. After I had run twenty yards and seen it disappear, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass and wept disconsolately.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rocks to}} take, not a sketch,--for who can sketch a {{mountain}} torrent?--but to note {{down on paper}} a kind of diagram, from which afterwards I might reconstruct an image of this feathery, frisky son of Kuhleborn.|$|R
60|$|His manner {{surprised}} me; {{he did not}} {{now seem}} like the Marcos Marcó I had travelled with that day. Touched with his words, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stocks facing him, and begged him {{to tell me what}} I could do for him.|$|R
60|$|Returning from {{a hunting}} trip, I {{waited at the}} little town of Los Pinos, in New Mexico, for the south-bound train, which was one hour late. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch of the Summit House and {{discussed}} the functions of life with Telemachus Hicks, the hotel proprietor.|$|E
60|$|But {{the evening}} passed, and no little man appeared, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony till the moon rose. Morning came, {{and with it}} the steamer, but still no watch arrived, as other coveted articles had often done, when we firmly refused to be imposed upon.|$|E
60|$|We steamed {{along very}} fast now. There was no {{stopping}} anywhere. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck and thought a little, and dozed a little; {{and by the}} time it was morning, I found we were in the Savannah River. I now hated this river worse than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Deil ane o' them kens {{it except}} mysell," [...] exclaimed Madge; [...] "how suld they, the puir fule cowards! But <b>I</b> hae <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grave frae batfleeing time till cook-crow, and had mony a fine crack wi' Muschat and Ailie Muschat, that are lying {{sleeping}} below." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Charley! On many a {{night like}} this, and many a worse night, <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stones of the street, hushing you in my arms. Unsay those words without even saying you are sorry for them, and my arms are open to you still, and so is my heart.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa beside her, {{and told}} her all, without one word of excuse or concealment, from our last parting to the day of Césarine's death in Haiti: and she held my hand and listened all the while with breathless wonderment to my strange story.|$|R
60|$|One morning, a {{considerable}} {{time after the}} events narrated in the last chapter, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa waiting for breakfast, and engaged in an interesting conversation with Dumps. The only difference in our mode of communication was that Dumps talked with his eyes, I with my tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chap {{came in here}} {{directly}} {{you were}} gone--mumbled something about doing something for you. I didn't altogether like the look of him, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and watched. He hung around for a moment, and then, {{when he saw that}} I was sticking it out, he went off." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} my advice, {{and it was}} not long before he was in a sound slumber. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cask, steering as well as I could by the stars. Suddenly from out of the gloom ahead an object loomed up. I started to my feet and strained my eyes.|$|E
60|$|Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I {{do believe}} they were for me. I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost? He had done his work well. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair.|$|R
5000|$|During World War <b>I,</b> Carmichael <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Food Vigilance Committee, {{and argued}} that {{rationing}} should be introduced {{in order to prevent}} starvation of workers due to food shortages. [...] He was also a leading campaigner against conscription. [...] Following the war, he became the first president of the National Union of Ex-Service Men.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rock, {{awaiting}} Mr. Slinkton's return. The twilight was deepening and {{the shadows}} were heavy, {{when he came}} round the point, with his hat hanging at his button-hole, smoothing his wet hair {{with one of his}} hands, and picking out the old path with the other and a pocket-comb.|$|R
6000|$|... "There! {{my throat}} is sore, and I am hoarse. I wonder how that fairy knew <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> damp grass. I'm so sorry; for I did want a pony, {{and might have}} had it if I'd only minded," [...] said May, angry with herself for spoiling all her fun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{soft cushion}} I {{could not help}} but {{speculate}} on all that had transpired within the last few hours. Early in the morning my mind had been free from care that was anyway deep; now I was a fugitive, not knowing which way to turn or what to do.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{stool and}} opened my note-book. I headed the page: [...] "Sunrise in July: {{observations}} and emotions," [...] and I wrote down at once, lest I should forget it, that towards three o'clock a faint light is discernible, {{and added that}} this light gets stronger as <b>the</b> time goes <b>on.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{grass in}} front of her, feeling as I did so that the change of {{position}} in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to speak movingly while sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Instinctively I avoided eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading. Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{cushions}} {{covered with}} {{blue and red}} checks. The room was very hot, and I stared about uncomfortably. The old lady sat peering at nothing, in reverie. She was a hard-visaged, bosomless dame, clad in thick black cloth-like armour, and wearing an immense twisted gold brooch in the lace at her neck.|$|R
