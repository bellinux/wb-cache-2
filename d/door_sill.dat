They run along each side of the vehicle, from just behind the front wheel to just before the rear wheel, just below the level of the <b>door</b> <b>sills.</b> They are affixed to the vehicle's chassis, and their function is to protect the <b>door</b> <b>sills</b> and <b>door</b> bottoms from damage when crossing large obstacles (such as rocks - hence the name).|$|R

5000|$|The BMW Z1 is a two-seat {{roadster}} {{developed by}} BMW and produced from March 1989 to June 1991. The Z1 featured unusual doors which, instead of opening outward or upward, dropped {{down into the}} <b>door</b> <b>sills.</b> Only 8,000 examples of the Z1 were produced.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88.

2500|$|Gull-wing doors have a {{somewhat}} questionable reputation because of early examples like the Mercedes and the Bricklin. The 300 SL needed the door design as its tubular frame race car chassis design {{had a very}} high <b>door</b> <b>sill,</b> which in combination with a low roof would make a standard door opening very low and small. The Mercedes engineers solved the problem by also opening {{a part of the}} roof. The Bricklin was a more conventionally sized door but the actuation system was problematic in day-to-day use and led to unreliable operation until an aftermarket air-door upgrade was installed in all Bricklins. [...] In addition, there was some concern that in making the doors as light as possible they wouldn't provide adequate protection in side-impact accidents. There was, however, no indication that this concern was justified.|$|E
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the <b>door</b> <b>sill</b> and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E
25|$|The Crosswagon {{was made}} to look more like {{all-terrain}} vehicle by unique front and rear bumpers and <b>door</b> <b>sills</b> with steel inserts. After {{the introduction of the}} 159 in 2005 the Crosswagon remained in production, and in 2007 it was the last 156 to be discontinued.|$|R
25|$|The Z1 {{is unique}} for its plastic body panels and {{vertically}} sliding doors which {{drop into the}} <b>door</b> <b>sills.</b> It {{is one of the}} first BMWs to use a multi-link rear suspension.
