40|$|Recently, many {{lines of}} {{investigation}} in neuroscience and statistical physics have converged {{to raise the}} hypothesis that the underlying pattern of neuronal activation which results in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is nonlinear, with self-affine dynamics, while scalp-recorded EEG signals themselves are nonstationary. Therefore, traditional methods of EEG analysis may miss many properties inherent in such signals. Similarly, fractal analysis of EEG signals has shown scaling behaviors that may not be consistent with pure monofractal processes. In this study, we hypothesized that scalp-recorded human EEG signals may be better modeled as an underlying multifractal process. We utilized the Physionet online database, a publicly available database of human EEG signals as a standardized reference database for this study. Herein, we report the use of multifractal <b>detrended</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>analysis</b> on human EEG signals derived from waking and different sleep stages, and show evidence that supports the use of multifractal methods. Next, we compare multifractal <b>detrended</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>analysis</b> to a previously published multifractal technique, wavelet transform modulus maxima, using EEG signals from waking and sleep, and demonstrate that multifractal <b>detrended</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>analysis</b> has lower indices of variability.

40|$|<b>Detrend</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>analysis</b> (DFA) {{has become}} a choice method for {{effective}} analysis of a broad variety of nonstationary signals. We show in the present article that, provided the nonstationary fluctuations occur at a large enough time scale, an alternative approach {{can be obtained by}} using the Fourier series of the signal. More specifically, signal reconstructions considering Fourier series with increasing number of higher spectral components are subtracted from the signal, while the dispersion of such a difference is calculated. The slope of the loglog representation of the dispersions in terms of the time scale (reciprocal of the frequency) is calculated and used for the characterization of the signal. The detrend action in this methodology is performed by the early incorporation of the low frequency spectral components in the signal representation. The application of the spectral DFA to the analysis of heart rate variability data has yielded results which are similar to those obtained by traditional DFA. Because of the direct relationship with the spectral content of the analyzed signal, the spectral DFA may be used as a complementary resource for characterization and analysis of some types of nonstationary signals.

40|$|The {{sunspot number}} (SSN), the total solar {{irradiance}} (TSI), a TSI reconstruction, and the solar flare index (SFI), are analyzed for long-range persistence (LRP). Standard Hurst analysis yields H ≈ 0. 9, which suggests strong LRP. However, solar activity time series are non-stationary {{due to the}} almost periodic 11 year smooth component, and the analysis does not give the correct H for the stochastic component. Better estimates are obtained by <b>detrended</b> <b>fluctuations</b> <b>analysis</b> (DFA), but estimates are biased and errors are large due to the short time records. These time series can be modeled as a stochastic process of the form x(t) =y(t) +σ√(y(t)) w_H(t), where y(t) is the smooth component, and w_H(t) is a stationary fractional noise with Hurst exponent H. From ensembles of numerical solutions to the stochastic model, and application of Bayes' theorem, we can obtain bias and error bars on H and also {{a test of the}} hypothesis that a process is uncorrelated (H= 1 / 2). The conclusions from the present data sets are that SSN, TSI and TSI reconstruction almost certainly are long-range persistent, but with most probable value H≈ 0. 7. The SFI process, however, is either very weakly persistent (H< 0. 6) or completely uncorrelated. Some differences between stochastic properties of the TSI and its reconstruction indicate some error in the reconstruction scheme. Comment: 23 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

We consider in our analysis the transmitted flux in the intergalactic medium over the redshift range 2 ≤ z ≤ 4. 5 from a sample of 45 high-quality medium resolution (R ∼ 4300) quasar spectra obtained with Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) mounted on the Keck II 10 -m telescope, and from a sample of 19 high-quality high resolution (R ∼ 50000) quasar spectra obtained with Ultra-Violet and Visible Echelle Spectrograh (UVES) mounted on the ESO KUEYEN 8. 2 m telescope. The result of the DFA method applied to both datasets, shows that there exists a difference in the correlation properties between the short and long-range regimes: the slopes of the transmitted flux fluctuation function are different on small and large scales. The scaling exponents, α_ 1 = 1. 635 ± 0. 115 and α_ 2 = 0. 758 ± 0. 085 for the ESI/Keck sample and α_ 1 = 1. 763 ± 0. 128 and α_ 2 = 0. 798 ± 0. 084 for the UVES/VLT sample for the short and long range regime respectively. The transition between the two regims is observed at about ∼ 1. 4 h^- 1 Mpc (comoving). The fact that α_ 1 is always larger than α_ 2 for each spectrum supports the common view that the Universe is smoother on large scales than on small scales.

CHF was induced in dogs by aortic insufficiency & aortic constriction, and assessed by echocardiography.

LV fractional shortening was decreased at both 240 d and 720 d. Both PVCs and VT increased with CHF duration and showed a morning rise (2. 5 -fold & 1. 8 -fold increase at 6 AM-noon vs midnight- 6 AM) during CHF. The morning rise in HR at baseline was significantly attenuated by 52 % with development of CHF (at both 240 d & 720 d). Morning rise in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF) HRV at baseline was markedly attenuated with CHF. DFAα 1, DFAα 2, CD and SE all decreased with CHF by 31, 17, 34 and 7 %, respectively. Time-of-day-dependent variations in LF/HF, CD, DFA α 1 and SE, observed at baseline, were lost during CHF.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{empirical}} data coming from financial markets, like stock market indices, commodities, interest rates, traded volumes and foreign exchange rates have a multifractal structure. Multifractals were introduced in the field of economics to surpass the shortcomings of classical models like the fractional Brownian motion or GARCH processes. In this paper we investigate the multifractal behavior of Central and Eastern European foreign exchange rates, namely the Czech koruna, Croatian kuna, Hungarian forint, Polish zlot, Romanian leu and Russian rouble with respect to euro from January 13, 2000 to February 29, 2012. The dynamics of exchange rates is of interest for investors and traders, monetary and fiscal authorities, economic agents or policy makers. The exchange rate movements affect the international balance of payments, trade flows, and allocation of the resources in national and international economy. The empirical results from the multifractal <b>detrending</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>analysis</b> algorithm show that the six exchange rate series analysed display significant multifractality. Moreover, generating shuffled and surrogate time series, we analyze the sources of multifractality, long-range correlations and heavy-tailed distributions, and we find that this multifractal behavior can be mainly attributed to the latter. Finally, we propose a foreign exchange market inefficiency ranking by considering the multifractality degree as a measure of inefficiency. The regulators, through policy instruments, aim to improve the informational inefficiency of the markets, to reduce the associated risks and to ensure economic stabilization. Evaluation of the degree of information efficiency of foreign exchange markets, for Central and Eastern Europe countries, is important to assess to what extent these countries are prepared for the transition towards fully monetary integration. The weak form efficiency implies that the past exchange rates cannot help to improve forecasts about future spot exchange rates, therefore there are no opportunities for profit based upon past data. Our results show that the Russian foreign exchange market has the highest degree of efficiency while the Hungarian foreign exchange market is at the opposite side.
