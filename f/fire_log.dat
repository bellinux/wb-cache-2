5000|$|The {{disaster}} {{generated a}} fair amount of scholarly debate. Historian Arthur Thurner's Rebels on the Range: The Michigan Copper Miners' Strike of 1913-1914 raises the possibility that there actually might have been a fire {{in another part of the}} hall, perhaps in the chimney of the building. Perhaps the strongest argument against an actual fire is that none of the investigations found any witnesses who would claim there was a fire. The <b>fire</b> <b>log</b> of the Red Jacket Fire Department (the local fire department that responded to the fire call) also specifically states [...] "no fire".|$|E

40|$|Forest {{attributes}} and their abundances define the stand structural complexity available as habitat for faunal biodiversity; however, intensive anthropogenic disturbances {{have the potential}} to degrade and simplify forest stands. In this paper we develop an index of stand structural complexity and show how anthropogenic disturbances, namely <b>fire,</b> <b>logging,</b> livestock, and their combined presence, affect stand structural complexity in a southern Global Biodiversity Hotspot. From 2011 to 2013, we measured forest structural attributes as well as the presence of anthropogenic disturbances in 505 plots in the Andean zone of the La Araucanía Region, Chile. In each plot, understory density, coarse woody debris, number of snags, tree diameter at breast height, and litter depth were measured, along with signs of the presence of anthropogenic disturbances. Ninety-five percent of the plots showed signs of anthropogenic disturbance (N = 475), with the combined presence of <b>fire,</b> <b>logging,</b> and livestock being the most common disturbance (N = 222; 44 % of plots). The lowest values for the index were measured in plots combining <b>fire,</b> <b>logging,</b> and livestock. Undisturbed plots and plots with the presence of relatively old fires (> 70 years) showed the highest values for the index of stand structural complexity. Our results suggest that secondary forests < 70 -year post-fire event, with the presence of habitat legacies (e. g. snags and CWD), can reach a structural complexity as high as undisturbed plots. Temperate forests should be managed to retain structural attributes, including understory density (7. 2 ± 2. 5 # contacts), volume of CWD (22. 4 ± 25. 8 m 3 /ha), snag density (94. 4 ± 71. 0 stems/ha), stand basal area (61. 2 ± 31. 4 m 2 /ha), and litter depth (7. 5 ± 2. 7 cm). Achieving these values will increase forest structural complexity, likely benefiting a range of faunal species in South American temperate forests...|$|R

40|$|Disturbance is an {{important}} factor in determining the carbon balance and succession of forests. Until the early 1990 's researchers have focused on using optical or thermal sensors to detect and map forest disturbances from wild <b>fires,</b> <b>logging</b> or insect outbreaks. As part of a NASA Siberian mapping project, a study evaluated the capability of three different radar sensors (ERS, JERS and Radarsat) and an optical sensor (Landsat 7) to detect <b>fire</b> scars, <b>logging</b> and insect damage in the boreal forest. This paper describes the data sets and techniques used to evaluate the use of remote sensing to detect disturbance in central Siberian forests. Using images from each sensor individually and combined an assessment of the utility of using these sensors was developed. Transformed Divergence analysis and maximum likelihood classification revealed that Landsat data was the single best data type for this purpose. However, the combined use of the three radar and optical sensors did improve the results of discriminating these disturbances...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{potential}} vegetation is, however, controversial (Chiarucci et al. 2010), mainly because human activities (<b>fire,</b> <b>logging)</b> can alter vegetation {{to the point}} that the dynamics characterizing the potential vegetation type become impossible to attain. In our study area, human activities have mainly led to an increase in early successional species or the development of ericaceous species. Despite these changes in forest composition, potential vegetation types can be established. We conclude that the concept of potential vegetation type is relevant in studies comparing natural and present-day landscapes. However, the use of the potential vegetation type must be accompanied by a thorough knowledge of the impact of natural and human activities on forest dynamics.|$|R
