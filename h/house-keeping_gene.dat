PCR primer sets targeting the lap genes from the species of Listeria sensu stricto were designed and tested with 47 Listeria and 8 non-Listeria strains.

The PCR assays with Listeria sensu stricto-specific primers also successfully detected all species of Listeria sensu stricto and/or Listeria innocua from mixed culture-inoculated food samples, and each bacterium in food was verified by using the light scattering sensor that generated unique scatter signature for each species of Listeria tested.

The underlying rhythms are {{generated by a}} set of clock genes, which are expressed in an oscillating manner on transcriptional and translational levels. To investigate the avian circadian system, homologues of mammalian clock genes have been cloned in the house sparrow, a model organism in circadian research. Expression levels were investigated in the brain and in peripheral tissues, including the gastro-intestinal tract. Pronounced rhythmic mRNA expression was found in all tissues investigated.. Tissue-specific differences in temporal distribution, peak expression and amplitude suggest that the molecular composition of the avian circadian clock is distinct from that in mammals. A novel cryptochrome gene in birds is described and subsequent molecular analysis reveals that functionally diverse cryptochromes are present in the house sparrow. A comparison of clock gene expression normalised to different <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes.</b> demonstrates results on phasing and amplitude are strongly influenced by the selection of <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes</b> for normalisation.

40|$|The {{gene for}} acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long chain fatty acids, {{contains}} two promoter regions which control {{the generation of}} different forms of carboxylase mRNA. At least five different forms of carboxylase mRNA are generated by differential splicing of the two transcripts formed {{under the influence of}} two promoters. One of the two promoters is mainly responsible for the generation of a class of carboxylase mRNA species, pAU type, induced tissue specifically under lipogenic conditions; the other generates ACC mRNAs (FL-type) which are expressed under normal conditions but this expression is also stimulated under lipogenic conditions. In the present studies, we have characterized the promoter that is responsible for the FL-type of ACC mRNA. This promoter contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but five G/C motifs whose sequences are typical of transcriptional factor Sp 1 binding sites. However, the presence of these G/C motifs is not sufficient to drive the transcription of the gene under the control of this promoter. Expression of promoter activity requires three copies of 11 to 13 mer enhancer elements which are located in the region upstream to the G/C motifs. The presence of such enhancer elements in a <b>house-keeping</b> <b>gene</b> is unusual, and provides a new example where an enhancer element occurs in the CpG island-type promoter of a <b>house-keeping</b> <b>gene...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background and aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mRNA expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α and three hypoxia-inducible genes, CA 9, CA 12 and OPN, in NSCLC patients' plasma and to evaluate their potential as clinical tumor markers. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Plasma biomarkers have not yet been available as an effective clinical tool in screening or early diagnosis of lung cancer. The discovery of new potential tumor markers would have positive impact on the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients by helping to detect the disease in an early phase. Methods: mRNA expression of HIF- 1 α, OPN, CA IX and CA XII was studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Two <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes,</b> B 2 M and UBC, were used for normalization. mRNA levels were assessed in the 95 blood plasma samples of NSCLC patients and 24 blood plasma samples of healthy volunteers. The qRT-PCR results were statistically analysed. Results: No significant CA IX and CA XII expression was found to be detectable in blood plasma samples. Reasonable signals were obtained for OPN and HIF- 1 α and two <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes,</b> UBC and B 2 M. Elevated mRNA levels were observed in cancer patients' plasma. Statistically significant difference was found between UBC and OPN mRNA levels of healthy controls and NSCLC patients. The majority of correlations between mRNA levels and clinical parameters or blood biomarkers were not statistically significant. Neither did the survival analysis show any significant relationship between survival and mRNA levels. Conclusions: Due to low levels of circulating RNA in plasma quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction seems to be challenging for routine diagnostics. In this study, a statistically significant difference was found in UBC and OPN mRNA levels between the healthy controls and NSCLC patients. Therefore, it is possible that the plasma RNA levels have some diagnostic value, although the test specificities and sensitivities remained quite low compared to the requirements set for routine laboratory diagnostics. ...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{the reply}} to an {{original}} question: can we classify housekeeping and tissue specific genes {{on the basis of}} physical characteristics only, without directly assaying expression in different tissues? Distinguishing housekeeping and tissue specific genes is important in Evolution, where slowly diverging housekeeping genes are used for species discrimination. In Medicine the balance of cellular growth guaranteed by housekeeping genes is subverted in dis-eases like cancer. While in Microbiology pathogens housekeeping genes can enhance virulence. They are also essential in assay techniques like microarray, where <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes</b> are used to standardise numerical results. Traditionally, housekeeping and tissue specific genes have been classified using direct assay of mRNA presence across different tissues, but these experiments are costly and the results not easy to reproduce. Could we then distinguish the two classes only exploiting characteristics already available in databases, like exon length and measures of chromatin compact-ness? In this work a Naive Bayes classifier based only on these physical and functional char-acteristics is shown to achieve a 97 % success rate in classification of human <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes</b> (95 % for mouse and 92 % for fruit fly). The newly obtained lists of housekeeping and tissue specific genes adhere to the expected functions and tissue ex-pression patterns for these two classes. Overall, this original idea to apply a known classification technique to a relatively recent biological problem has shown promise, and, in the future, other attributes might be included to improve its discriminant power. i Acknowledgements I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Stuart Aitken, who helped me craft this project around my interests and curiosities.

30|$|Normalization in {{the absence}} of spike-ins or UMIs is {{generally}} performed using bulk RNA-seq methods. Several scRNA-seq studies have normalized for sequencing depth by calculating TPM [39, 59] and FPKM/RPKM [60 – 62]. More sophisticated between-cell normalization approaches include methods where scaling factors are computed, such as in DESeq [63], and edgeR [64]. Median-based normalization methods [43, 65 – 68] are also widely used. They calculate global scaling factors based on the identification of stable house-keeping genes. Their main premise is that variations in <b>house-keeping</b> <b>gene</b> expression are due to technical sources, however, this is not always valid due to variations in RNA content. The amount of RNA contained in each cell varies intrinsically due to cell-cycle, cell size, and transcriptional gene dynamics [69].

This often leaves aside organs the metabolism of which strongly depends on mitochondrial energy metabolism as well, such as heart, kidney or liver. Additionally, in some patients, a complex pattern of tissue-specific enzyme defect was also observed. The lack of functional additional copies of Krebs cycle genes suggests that the complex expression pattern should be ascribed to tissue-specific regulations of transcriptional and/or translational activities, together with a variable cell adaptability to Krebs cycle functional defects...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Alteromonas are Gram-negative, {{strictly}} aerobic, motile, heterotrophic marine bacteria known for their versatile metabolic activities. Identification and classification of novel species belonging to the genus Alteromonas generally involves DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) as distinct species often fail to be resolved at the 97 % threshold value of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity. In this study, the applicability of Multilocus Phylogenetic Analysis (MLPA) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the differentiation of Alteromonas species has been evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis incorporating five <b>house-keeping</b> <b>genes</b> (dnaK, sucC, rpoB, gyrB, and rpoD) revealed a threshold value of 98. 9 % {{that could be considered}} as the species cut-off value for the delineation of Alteromonas spp. MALDI-TOF MS data analysis reconfirmed the Alteromonas species clustering. MLPA and MALDI-TOF MS both generated data that were comparable to that of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and may be considered as useful complementary techniques for the description of new Alteromonas species...|$|R
