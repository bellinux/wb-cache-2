25|$|The {{selective}} absorption of infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>light</b> {{by a particular}} material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate.

25|$|One of {{the last}} steps in the process before {{reaching}} the target chamber is to convert the infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>light</b> at 1053nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351nm in a device known as a frequency converter. These are made of thin sheets (about 1cm thick) cut from a single crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When the 1053nm (<b>IR)</b> <b>light</b> passes through {{the first of two}} of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527nm light and the remaining 1053nm light into 351nm (UV) light. <b>IR</b> <b>light</b> is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot electrons which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat temporal shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8MJ.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of an}} {{infrared}} sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems when other infrared sources are around, such as incandescent light bulbs or candles. This can be easily alleviated by using fluorescent lights around the Wii, which emit little to no infrared light. Innovative users have used other sources of <b>IR</b> <b>light</b> as Sensor Bar substitutes such {{as a pair of}} flashlights and a pair of candles. The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor, then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer on your screen. Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of non-moving lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote is pointing and its physical location relative to the light sources. There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user is pointing the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes. Third-party wireless sensor bars have also been released, which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{forensic}} chemists rely {{on numerous}} instruments to identify unknown materials {{found at a}} crime scene. [...] The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. [...] The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>light.</b> [...] Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. [...] It {{was not until the}} coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. [...] Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, {{to make sense of the}} enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. [...] Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive [...] and extremely quick to use. [...] Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. [...] AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.|$|E
