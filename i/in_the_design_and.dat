5|$|Born in Hammersmith, West London, Hollamby {{served in}} the Royal Marines during the Second World War before embarking on a career in architecture. Involved with the Communist Party of Great Britain and other leftist groups, his socialist beliefs led him {{to work in the}} public sector, first for the Miners' Welfare Commission and then for London County Council (LCC), where he was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction of such modernist post-war housing estates as Bethnal Green's Avebury Estate, Kennington's Brandon Estate, and Deptford's Pepys Estate.|$|E
5|$|He {{meanwhile}} {{worked under}} Leslie Martin {{as a senior}} architect at the Architects' Department of the London County Council (LCC) from 1949 to 1962. During this period, he oversaw the design of two neighbouring schools in North Hammersmith, {{now known as the}} Phoenix School; he unsuccessfully tried to have the school named after Morris. He was also involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction of several modernist, high-rise post-war housing estates, namely Bethnal Green's Avebury Estate and Kennington's Brandon Estate, personally securing a sculpture by Henry Moore for the latter. In his final years in this position he focused on estates in south London, working on Deptford's Pepys Estate and the first designs for what became Thamesmead.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Institut Laue–Langevin, Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the neutron magnetic moment and finding a limit to its electric dipole moment. As President of the Universities Research Association during the 1960s he was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction of the Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. He also headed a 1982 National Research Council committee that concluded that, contrary {{to the findings of}} the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, that acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman's involvement in the assassination of President John F.

5|$|John Philip Kemble {{took over}} the producer's (director's) duties at Drury Lane later in 1788 when Sheridan was {{promoted}} to chief treasurer. Sheridan often employed Grimaldi in minor roles in Kemble's productions and continued {{to allow him to}} work concurrently at Sadler's Wells. Grimaldi took an interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction of stage scenery and would often help to design sets. His stage performances {{over the next two years}} did not garner him the kind of success he had experienced under the management of his father, and the role of pre-eminent Clown in London productions soon fell to Jean-Baptiste Dubois, a versatile French acrobat, horseman, singer and strongman, with a formidable repertoire of comic tricks. Grimaldi worked as Dubois' assistant, although in later life he denied that he had been the Frenchman's student.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nelson {{was hard}} for the colonists. The company had limited {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> building of houses in the area.

5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E
5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E

5|$|The Lahore Fort {{was built}} in 1566 {{under the rule of}} Mughal emperor Akbar the Great on the {{location}} of an earlier mud-fort. The solid brick masonry complex was later extended and modified by subsequent emperors. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was a romantic man who constrcuted Taj mahal in agra and after that this master piece in Lahore {{was built in}} 1633 as a small summer house costing around 900,000 rupees - an exorbitant amount at the time. Naulakha Pavilion is among the buildings that were erected or reconstructed between 1628 and 1634 under Shah Jahan's rule. Due to his personal interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction, Shah Jahan's architectural traditions manifest distinctive symmetry and hierarchical accents. Naulakha Pavilion is part of the Shah Burj block in the northwest section of the fort that was actually built by his predecessor Jahangir.|$|E

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
