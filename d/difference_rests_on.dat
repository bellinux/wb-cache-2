60|$|It {{has been}} objected that our {{domestic}} dogs cannot be descended from wolves or jackals, because their periods of gestation are different. The supposed <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> {{statements made by}} Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and others; but these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to agree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it is often in some degree variable. (1/42. J. Hunter shows that the long period of seventy-three days given by Buffon is easily explained by the bitch having received the dog many times {{during a period of}} sixteen days ('Phil. Transact.' 1787 page 353). Hunter found that the gestation of a mongrel from wolf and dog ('Phil. Transact.' 1789 page 160) apparently was sixty-three days, for she received the dog more than once. The period of a mongrel dog and jackal was fifty-nine days. Fred. Cuvier found the period of gestation of the wolf to be ('Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 4 page 8) two months and a few days, which agrees with the dog. Isid G. St.-Hilaire, who has discussed the whole subject, and from whom I quote Bellingeri, states ('Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 112) that in the Jardin des Plantes the period of the jackal {{has been found to be}} from sixty to sixty-three days, exactly as with the dog.) Tessier, who has closely attended to this subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the dog. The Rev. W.D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases of retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not counting this day, but counting that of parturition, the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days. The average period is sixty-three days; but Bellingeri states that this applies only to large dogs; and that for small races it is from sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had much experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be longer with large than with small dogs.|$|E

The <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a deistic god that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene.

30|$|In {{this paper}} it has {{therefore}} been explored by what arrangements concerning the innovation process in firms {{and other organizations}} the risk of an innovation ending up with excessive social costs can be kept down. As has been explained, the epistemic bounds on anticipating the implications of new technical and economic activities prevent an immediate solution. However, {{by means of a}} simple model exercise {{it has been shown that}} the internal reaction of firms and organizations in their innovating teams can differ dramatically with respect to how quickly an innovation developing signs of failure is stopped. The <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> how the knowledge flows related to an innovation are strategically shaped, namely in the fashion of open or closed innovation processes. Closed innovation regimes can fail to draw the right conclusions from the information successively revealed about the implications of an innovation. The more open the innovation process is, the more likely it is in contrast that an innovation be abandoned when there are hints pointing at a failure.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{exploits}} a novel cheating game - the ?Mind Game? - to {{show how}} a subtle variation in {{the rules of the}} game affects cheating. In both variants of the game, cheating is invisible because subjects make their choices purely in their minds. The only <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the order of the steps in which subjects should play the game. I find that subjects cheat significantly less when they have to disregard the prescribed order of steps in order to cheat, compare to when they can purely lie about the choice made in the mind. Since subjects play the game in private with a double-blind payment procedure, I conjecture that subjects only cheat to the extent that their moral self-image is still preserved. But the moral image can be preserved if they can deceive themselves into believing that at least their intentions are good, and not if cheating requires an act that reveals the intent to cheat. This study thus suggests a potential role of intent inference in deterring cheating...|$|E
40|$|Consequentialist {{positions}} in philosophy spell out normative notions by recourse to final aims. Hedonistic versions of ETHICAL consequentialism spell {{out what is}} MORALLY right/justified via recourse to the aim of increasing pleasure and decreasing pain. Veritistic versions of EPISTEMIC consequentialism spell out what is EPISTEMICALLY right/justified via recourse to the aim of {{increasing the number of}} true beliefs and decreasing the number of false ones. Even though these theories are in many respects structurally analogous, there are also interesting disanalogies. For example, popular versions of epistemic consequentialism implicitly endorse the truth-indication principle (which claims that a belief is epistemically justified only if there are factors indicating that the belief itself is true), whereas popular versions of ethical consequentialism do not subscribe to an analogous pleasure-indicating principle (which claims that an act is morally justified only if there are factors indicating that performing the act itself is pleasurable). In a first step I will argue that this <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the fact that plausible versions of epistemic consequentialism have to meet certain constraints, which versions of ethical consequentialism do not have to satisfy. As these constraints can be easily met by incorporating the truth-indication principle, epistemic consequentialists tend to subscribe to it. In a second step I will investigate whether the identified constraints can also be met independent from the truth-indication principle. Are there plausible versions of veritistic epistemic consequentialism that reject the principle, thereby allowing that some beliefs can be epistemically justified even though no factors speak in favor of their truth? Building on ideas put forward by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Crispin Wright, and others, I will answer this question affirmatively...|$|E

40|$|I {{begin with}} a rather unpromising dispute that Nozick once had with Ian Hacking {{in the pages of}} the London Review of Books, in which both vied with one another in their enthusiasm to {{repudiate}} the thesis that some human people or peoples are closer than others to animality. I shall attempt to show that one can build, on the basis of Nozick's discussion of rationality, a defense of the view that the capacity for language places human rationality out of reach of a comparison with animals. The <b>difference</b> <b>rests,</b> paradoxically, <b>on</b> the human capacity for irrationality. Irrationality depends on the capacity for language, which allows the detachment of explicit thoughts from their underlying dynamic implementation; these, in turn, condition the essential disputability of principles of rationality.

40|$|This is an ethnographic {{study of}} the concept of suicide in Qeqertaq, a small {{settlement}} in northwest Greenland. Research into suicide is often driven by a quest for identifying causalities. However, this study suggests it is by taking a broader view that a very different and local causality of suicide emerges. This thesis suggests that suicide may be understood as an extreme way of recreating relatedness. Part I: Relatedness: Having been bestowed the names of recently deceased relatives upon birth each person in Qeqertaq is a ‘returned person’. Names are vehicles for relatedness and personhood, which achieve their full potential, through repeated acts and processes of re-invoking relatedness. Uttering names and kinship terminologies in particular ways, sharing and eating particular foods and visiting particular places in the landscape are ways of re-invoking relatedness. This continuum, I suggest, feeds into a particular form of morality of circumventing feelings of longing, homesickness, bereavement and loneliness. Part II: Loneliness: Although people without relatives are virtually non-existent, they recognise loneliness as a predicament that can defeat anyone if relatedness is not re-invoked. Local concepts and feelings of longing and homesickness are instrumental in maintaining both relatedness as well as the aversion to loneliness and thus bring relatedness and loneliness together {{in such a way that}} the re-invocation of one becomes a vehicle for the continued re-invocation of the other. Both relatedness and loneliness are tied up with expectations and disappointments in relatedness and I argue that their interplay is part of a broader social pattern of ‘turning towards’ and ‘turning away’ of which the disappointed characters of the suicide and the dangerous ghost-like figure of qivittoq are parts. By comparing suicide and qivittoq as two extraordinary characters that ‘turn away’ and cross a threshold into loneliness, I suggest that their <b>differences</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the degree of irreversibility in which they ‘turn away’.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Wājid ‘Alī Shāh Plays Krishna’s Stolen Flute: The Multiplicity of Voices in the King of Awadh’s Dramatic Work Genoveva Castro Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Heidi Pauwels Department of Asian Languages and Literature This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} an instance of cultural exchange between Hindus and Muslims {{in the context of}} 19 th century theater in South Asia. Specifically, it investigates Hindu-Muslim assimilation in the artistic production at the court of the last king of Awadh. Through an analysis of text and performance traditions present at the court the narrative of Hindi-Urdu drama {{at the beginning of the}} modern period is reframed. Wājid ‘Alī Shāh (1822 - 1887) was the king of Awadh on the eve of the colonial takeover. He ruled from 1847 to 1856, and subsequently moved to Calcutta after the British assumed control of the kingdom. He was not only a ruler during a turning point of Indian history, but also a poet and dramatist. His literary work was often a reflection of his interest in dance and music, as well as of the multifaceted milieu in which he lived. Thus, although Wājid ‘Alī Shāh was a Muslim, he wrote two versions of a dance-drama entitled Rādhā Kanhaiyā kā qiṣṣah based on a Hindu theme that was popular in Vaishnava circles. This dissertation presents an annotated translation of the two versions of the Rādhā Kanhaiyā kā qiṣṣah occurring in Banī (1877), the first such translations into English. Framed within the historical and cultural context, the literary work of Wājid ‘Alī Shāh is analyzed here, considering a diversity of influences in comparison to several contemporary plays. Wājid ‘Alī Shāh’s dance-dramas are contrasted with the contemporary Indar sabhā, a commercial play by the Muslim poet Amānat. Specifically, this juxtaposition reveals the common folk song and courtesan performance borrowings of the court-based dance-dramas and the Indar sabhā. But the <b>difference</b> <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the heavier influence of Urdu poetry and Persian narrative of the Indar sabhā on the one hand and the Krishnaite idiom of the qiṣṣah on the other. 	Further insight is obtained by a subsequent comparison with a Braj devotional play by Lalit Kiśorī, also a contemporary playwright. A translation and edition of the unpublished play by Lalit Kiśorī is provided along with a contrastive examination with the qiṣṣah. The previous inspection exposes the same theme of the stolen flute of Krishna in the court and the temple setting which signals the influence of Braj devotional theater in the work of Wājid ‘Alī Shāh. 	Moreover, the relation between the court and the temple calls for an integrated narrative of Hindi and Urdu theater, instead of a treatment of Hindi and Urdu literary cultures as two separate exclusive categories. Finally, the theme of the stolen flute is traced in Vaishnava literature in Sanskrit and Braj over the centuries to reinforce Wājid ‘Alī Shāh’s adaptation of a literary tradition. This dissertation concludes that cultural productions at the court were not fixed according to a religious identity or particular language, but rather constitute an example of a Hindu-Muslim encounter...|$|E
40|$|Seria adequado codificar as políticas de ação afirmativa em universidades brasileiras como “ideias fora do lugar”, estranhas a contornos e padrões de sociabilidade “caracteristicamente brasileiros”? Em linhas gerais, há duas percepções que, a despeito de contrastantes, apoiam-se sobre a imagem do Brasil como um caso marcadamente excepcional: por um lado, fala-se deste como um cenário isento das asperezas e fricções raciais observadas em outros países; por outro, alude-se a uma condição na qual conflitos e preconceitos raciais permaneceriam na maior parte do tempo velados e obscurecidos, razão maior da dificuldade de identificá-los. Eis a questão orientadora do artigo: a tese da “excepcionalidade brasileira” – que encontra na noção de democracia racial um de seus pilares fundamentais - é capaz de apreender as experiências recentes de ação afirmativa no Brasil? Ao nos debruçarmos sobre alguns dos processos sociais, políticos e históricos que desaguaram na formulação e implementação dessas políticas, buscamos identificar os desafios teórico-metodológicos enfrentados por tal tese.   [...] -Race and the "Theory of Brazilian exceptionalism": a {{reflexion}} in {{the light}} of affirmative actionHow accurate is it to coin affirmative action policies in Brazilian universities as “misplaced ideas”, alien to contours and patterns of sociability seen as “typically Brazilian”?

The article aims at the following debate: is such a thesis of the “Brazilian exceptionality” – which relies on the notion of racial democracy as one of its main pillars – capable of grasping the recent experiences of affirmative action in Brazil? While looking into the social, political and historical processes that ushered in the formulation and implementation of this set of policies, we intend to bring to light some of the theoretical and methodological challenges faced by such thesis.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I argue that Freud’s celebrated case history of The Wolf Man {{is haunted by}} the spectre of species difference. His {{manifest}} aetiology of the patient’s early illness is strongly focused on the latter’s response to the ‘primal scene’ of parental coupling and to the vision {{of male and female}} genitalia with which the scene confronts him. I suggest that Freud’s account of the case, in which the key factor is thus the orthodox psychoanalytic theme of sexual <b>difference</b> and castration, <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> a tacit discounting of another modality of difference: differences among and between other creatures and in particular between human and non-human animals. The goal of the essay is not, however, to put species difference ‘back’ into The Wolf Man by fleshing out some alternative aetiology independently and at a remove. Rather, through a close analysis of the case history and with contextual reference to a frequently overlooked strand of Freudian theorizing, I try to show that the text already retains certain overdetermined traces which, against the grain, adumbrate the significance of species difference – though these are localised, displaced and foreshortened, and in no sense claimed as part of Freud’s manifest clinical narrative...|$|R
60|$|That {{all these}} governments of {{confusion}} will drift towards war, with a spacious impulse {{and a final}} vehemence quite out of comparison greater than the warlike impulses of former times, is a remarkable {{but by no means}} inexplicable thing. A tone of public expression, jealous and patriotic to the danger-point, is an unavoidable condition under which democratic governments exist. To be patriotically quarrelsome is imperative upon the party machines that will come to dominate the democratic countries. They will not possess detailed and definite policies and creeds because there are no longer any detailed and definite public opinions, but they will for all that require some ostensible purpose to explain their cohesion, some hold upon the common man that will ensure his appearance in numbers at the polling place sufficient to save the government from the raids of small but determined sects. That hold can be only of one sort. Without moral or religious uniformity, with material interests as involved and confused as a heap of spelicans, there remains only one generality for the politician's purpose, the ampler aspect of a man's egotism, his pride in what he imagines to be his particular kind--his patriotism. In every country amenable to democratic influences there emerges, or will emerge, a party machine, vividly and simply patriotic--and indefinite upon the score of any other possible consideration between man and man. This will hold true, not only of the ostensibly democratic states, but also of such reconstituted modern monarchies as Italy and Germany, for they, too, for all their legal <b>difference,</b> <b>rest</b> also <b>on</b> the grey. The party conflicts of the future will turn very largely on the discovery of the true patriot, on the suspicion that the crown or the machine in possession is in some more or less occult way traitorous, and almost all other matters of contention will be shelved and allowed to stagnate, for fear of breaking the unity of the national mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the hypothesis that there is a difference in the morphology of the lips of Class II div 1 and Class III malocclusion, before and after orthodontic treatment. Methods: The sample subjects included 20 adult female patients with Angle Class II div 1 malocclusion and 30 adult female patients with dento-skeletal Class III malocclusion. Frontal photographs were taken both before and after ortho-dontic and/or orthognathic treatment. Thirty-five landmarks were placed on each tracing made from the photograph. Thereafter, landmarks were digitized into an x and y coordinates system with the subnasal point as the origin. The Class II pretreatment and posttreatment groups of rest and smile conditions were compared with the Class III group respec-tively, using t-tests. Results: In the Class II pretreatment group, upper and lower lips positioned downward than that in the Class III group. When smiling, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups before treatment, whereas after orthodontic treatment both Class II and Class III groups showed the significant <b>difference</b> at <b>rest</b> and <b>on</b> smiling condi-tions. On smiling condition Class III group showed more upwards and lateral movement of the mouth corners than Class II group. Conclusion: Orthodontic treatment induced larger amount in movement of lips at smiling in both Class II and III patients, which may reflect the emotional changes in the patients after treatment...|$|R
