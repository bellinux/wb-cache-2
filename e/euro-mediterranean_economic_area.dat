40|$|The {{economic}} {{profiles of}} southern Mediterranean countries (SMCs) bear some resemblance {{to those of}} south-eastern European countries and some former Soviet republics {{at the beginning of}} their economic transition in 1990. The SMCs resemble less the former communist countries that joined the European Union in 2004. The SMCs are more advanced in terms of market reforms, but less well equipped with human capital and infrastructure, than the former communist countries were in the early 1990 s. The EU’s willingness to underpin reforms in central and south eastern Europe and hold out the prospect of EU membership contributed to substantial growth, highlighting the long-term value of partnership with the EU. Long-term partnership has so far been absent for the southern Mediterranean countries. The existing Union for the Mediterranean framework is too weak to provide the necessary EU support to domestic reforms in the SMCs, and to ensure the desired stability and prosperity in the region. To encourage a successful transition in the SMCs, a <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> should be established by 2030...|$|E
40|$|The {{countries}} of the Middle Eastand North Africa (MENA) have lost the geographic advantage {{they used to have}} because of their proximity to the European Union at a time when Eastern Europe was effectively closed to open exchange with the West. The Central and Eastern European countries are beginning to exploit their own proximity, together with relatively low wages and significant stocks of human capital, and are formidable competitors with MENA. To compete, the MENA countries must implement more far-reaching liberalization, privatization, and deregulation. It has been a basic tenet in MENA countries that economic reform must be gradual to avoid causing social disruption. This has often meant little effort publicizing reform and mobilizing political support. Partial and slow reform has led to uncertainty in firms and households and a lack of credibility. The slower the pace of reform and the less comprehensive its scope, the greater the gap between MENA's performance {{and the rest of the}} world is likely to become. Without a significant private sector supply response and inward foreign direct investment, political support for reform will be limited, and a vicious circle may result. The creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the offer of the European Union to establish a <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> provide possible institutional frameworks to make a gradual reform strategy more credible. Full participation in the WTO could move the trade regime closer to"good practices,"improve trade institutions, help lock in trade reform, make trade policy implementation more transparent, diminish bureaucratic red tape, and force firms to go through GATT-sanctioned mechanisms for temporary safeguard protection. An agreement with the European Union to establish a free trade and investment area could offset some of the WTO's regulatory and administrative loopholes, could (by providing financial transfers) overcome resistance to reform, and could ensure investors that MENA governments are committed to far-reaching integration with the European Union. But neither option is a panacea. Both should be pursued simultaneously.

40|$|SUMMARY – The Euro-Mediterranean {{free trade}} area is usually seen as a {{challenge}} by Southern European agriculture. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the economic and political constrains on the inclusion of the agricultural trade as an essential element of the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>economic</b> space. The discussion includes an assessment of the existing EU trade concessions granted to Southern Mediterranean countries, a reference of the present imbalances of the Common Agricultural Policy and a review of the debate on fair trade as a precondition to free trade. The paper supports the view that the rural sector should deserve more attention in the current negotiations within the Barcelona process leading to a Euro-Mediterranean zone of partnership and prosperity...|$|R
40|$|In 1954 Nebraska Census of Agriculture divided Nebraska {{into eight}} <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> These <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> were {{determined}} {{by the type of}} agriculture prevalent in each. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 1 included the Sandhills ranching region of Nebraska. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 2 was located in the southwestern part of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 a included the area beginning just west of North Platte, following the Platte River to just east of Grand Island. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b is located in north central Nebraska just east of <b>Economic</b> <b>Areas</b> 1 and 3 a. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 4 lay along the Kansas border extending from Nuckolls County to the Colorado state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 5 included that land south of <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b to the Kansas state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 6 was located in the northeastern area of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 7 was situated in the southeastern section of the state. Several studies have previously been conducted in Nebraska concerning the occupational status of former vocational agriculture graduates. These studies were conducted on a local school basis. This study, however, was conducted on a statewide level. It was designed to determine the relationship of occupational factors of Nebraska’s farm males, graduated from high school nine to thirteen years earlier, to the <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> of Nebraska in which they lived on the day of graduation. The specific objectives of the study were to determine: The relationship between graduates’ occupations and selected home environmental characteristics by Nebraska economic area; The relationship between graduates’ occupational and educational background by Nebraska occupational area; and Some measures of occupational status of graduates by Nebraska <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> Graduates included in the study were those whose fathers were farming on the day their sons graduated from high school or who had farmed during most of the time that their sons were in high school. Graduates who had enrolled in six or more semesters of vocational agriculture were also included in the study. The final sample of respondents numbered 1120; the final response rate was 92. 6 per cent. Advisor: A. A. Kahle...|$|R
40|$|The author {{points out}} the {{increasing}} complexity of Euro-Mediterranean relations and the ever more differentiated relationships. He underlines the return to a more intergovernmentalist approach promoted by the UfM {{and the creation of}} an “avant-garde” generated by an ENP positive conditionality approach. At bilateral level, Mediterranean partners must decide to what extent they can go further in the process of economic integration with the EU. At multilateral level, the next step is a comprehensive understanding of what could be the future <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>economic</b> model of integration. The author alerts us {{to the development of a}} multi-speed UfM that could lead to the division of Mediterranean partners into two subgroups: the “good” and “rewarded students” and the “bad” and “non-rewarded students”. Finally, the question of the definitive articulation between the old institutional structures of the Barcelona Process and the new ones has still to be more precisely defined...|$|R

40|$|A {{question}} {{fundamental to}} {{sustainable economic growth}} is whether a poor region tends to grow faster than a rich one, such that the poor region catches up with the rich region {{in terms of the}} level of per capita income. In this article, we apply the spatial panel data approach to the analysis of regional income convergence across 177 <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> in the contiguous US states over the period from 1969 to 2009. Using data on per capita incomes in the functionally defined <b>economic</b> <b>areas,</b> we find that the absolute value of the estimated coefficient of the initial per capita income decreases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial lag model and increases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial error model. This result implies that the growth rate in a specific <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> will be not only directly affected by an exogenous shock introduced into that <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> but also be impacted more by both the indirect effects of the first-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> and the induced effects of the higher-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> This gives helpful hints on the issue of spatial interaction and regional policy coordination to start a virtuous circle of sustainable economic growth...|$|R
