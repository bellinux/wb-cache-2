5|$|The script {{remained}} under Columbia's shelf until {{legal issues}} {{forced them to}} withdraw. The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of Double <b>Indemnity</b> entitled Big Trouble. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to Double <b>Indemnity</b> and they needed the permission of Universal Pictures, owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With Big Trouble already set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script for Back to the Future during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the Double <b>Indemnity</b> license {{in exchange for the}} rights to Back to the Future. Thus, the film finally had a home at Universal.|$|E
5|$|Kaifeng was besieged on January 31, 1126.

5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated <b>indemnity.</b> At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an <b>indemnity.</b> The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal officials could not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an <b>indemnity.</b> After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an <b>indemnity</b> of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E

The present {{article focuses}} on the <b>indemnities</b> from public administrations to the Galician fishing sector damaged by the Prestige oil slick. Despite {{the fact that the}} fishing sector is compounded of quite different activities direct allowances were standardized. We analyze the distributional effects of the uniform <b>indemnities</b> among the four main fishing activities on the area: coastal fishing, aquaculture, seafood harvesting on-foot and seafood harvesting on-boat. We also estimate the total cost of <b>indemnities.</b> The paper shows how a simple re-allocation of public funds could rectify the redistributive effects of the uniform allowances. We specify the non standard <b>indemnities</b> to the main fishing activities damaged by the oil slick.
