40|$|Deformed <b>ice</b> {{such as an}} <b>ice</b> ridge or an <b>ice</b> rubble field may {{impose a}} large load on {{hydraulic}} structures in ice-covered areas due to its large thickness (h) and consolidated layer. A consolidated layer, which is considered to have higher strength than a sail or a keel, is modeled in a cold room for <b>ice</b> indentation tests. It is rational that an <b>ice</b> load imposed by a consolidated layer of deformed <b>ice</b> should be compared with that imposed by the surrounding (un-deformed) <b>ice</b> sheet, since many <b>ice</b> load equations for level <b>ice</b> sheets have been suggested. In this paper, the <b>ice</b> load of deformed <b>ice</b> is {{compared with that of}} level (un-deformed) <b>ice</b> through <b>ice</b> indentation tests, using saline and freshwater <b>ice</b> sheets. Indentation velocity (V) and cubic <b>ice</b> block size (a) were varied, and the effects of (a/h), (V/h) and <b>ice</b> failure on the <b>ice</b> load were investigated...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and <b>icing</b> are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, <b>icing</b> due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its practicality, departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience.

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and <b>icing</b> of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> II is a rhombohedral {{crystalline}} form of <b>ice</b> with a highly-ordered structure. It is formed from <b>ice</b> Ih by compressing it at temperature of 198 K at 300 MPa or by decompressing <b>ice</b> V. When heated it undergoes transformation to <b>ice</b> III. Ordinary water <b>ice</b> {{is known as}} <b>ice</b> Ih, (in the Bridgman nomenclature). Different types of <b>ice,</b> from <b>ice</b> II to <b>ice</b> XVI, have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves <b>icing</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an <b>icing,</b> frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} cause of the accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of ice and snow on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe <b>icing</b> conditions following takeoff. Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and passengers on board, there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E
