Following the ruling that States are entitled to <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> before foreign courts even if their sovereign acts amount to violations of peremptory norms, the Court found that Italy had violated Germany’s immunity from jurisdiction and enforcement.

40|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} of whether Italian courts are directly bound to give effect to the <b>Jurisdictional</b> <b>Immunities</b> decision depends on both the content of the obligations established by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concerning remedies and the peculiarities of the Italian legal system. While the ICJ affords a certain margin of appreciation to Italy in the implementation of the dispositif, the requirement that judicial decisions infringing Germany’s immunity must cease to have effect confirms a consistent trend towards the expansion of the subjective scope of ICJ judgments. The problem of whether action by either the executive or the legislative branches of government is an essential prerequisite for court implementation of the ICJ judgment should be solved by having regard to both pre-existing domestic judicial proceedings and the hierarchical rank of the obligation to comply under domestic law. It is argued that national courts have to ensure direct application of the <b>Jurisdictional</b> <b>Immunities</b> judgment in ongoing proceedings where no decision has become final. In addition, recent practice shows that even the tension between the duty to comply and the principle of res judicata might be resolved by the judiciary, giving prevalence to the former...|$|R

40|$|The author {{comments}} on the case currently pending before the International Court of Justice between Germany and Italy concerning the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> of the State in respect of actions for compensation for international crimes committed during the the Second World War. The article focuses on the recent case law of the Italian Supreme Court which has affirmed {{an exception to the}} customary rules on State immunity, due to the higher rank of rules protecting fundamental rights of the person. The author contends that the position maintained by the Corte di cassazione is unpersuasive under various respects: first, for inter-temporal reasons, since the notion of ius cogens was not sufficiently established at the time when the offences were committed. Secondly, even if, for the purposes of <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities,</b> regard were to be had to the rules in force at the moment of the judicial action, it is not sufficiently established that ius cogens norms are likely to prevail not just on conflicting treaties, but on other customary rules as well. Thirdly, the said rules are not conflicting, since their object is different: rules on <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> do not prevent the prosecution of international crimes nor the protection of the fundamental rights involved. Rather, they address the procedural aspect of deciding where the action is to be entertained. Subsequently, the article touches upon other issues addressed by the Corte di cassazione in the said case law, such as the availability of universal jurisdiction in respect of actions of the like, the non-applicability of statutory limitations, the effect of the waiver clauses contained in the peace treaties and in the later compensatory agreements, and, ultimately, the existence of an individual right to compensation for international crimes enforceable against foreign States. Concerning the latter, the author concludes that either, as it seems more likely, such a right did not exist {{at the time of the}} facts, or, if it then existed, later actions are to be deemed as barred by the said waiver clauses...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} the rules of public international law governing the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> {{of the armed forces}} of one State present in the territory of another State with the latter’s consent. The thesis is divided into three main parts. The first part considers the general principles of international law governing the exercise of jurisdiction over visiting armed forces and describes the historical evolution of the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> enjoyed by such forces. The second part examines the legal arrangements adopted by the European Union and its Member States in order to define the immunities of personnel acting {{in the context of the}} European Security and Defence Policy in the form of a case-study. The third part draws together and assesses the findings of the preceding-two parts. The <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>immunities</b> of visiting armed forces have received insufficient attention in the academic literature, and considerable ambiguities remain concerning the current position of customary international law in this area. The thesis argues that it is possible to identify a separate ‘law of visiting forces’ in customary international law, though it would go too far to consider this law a self-contained regime along the lines of the law of diplomatic immunity. Not only is the ‘law of visiting forces’ more rudimentary than the highly developed and detailed rules governing diplomatic relations, but a combination of factors has so far prevented the emergence of a uniform legal regime in this field. Instead, several distinct regimes governing the status of different types of visiting forces have developed in international practice, in particular the rules applied in peace support operations and those applied in the context of structured military cooperation between politically equal partners. Whenever possible, States and international organizations prefer to regulate the legal position of visiting armed forces by way of international agreements. Certain elements of these agreements have developed into norms of customary international law, yet the existence of significant variation in treaty practice means that the relevant legal arrangements have not passed into customary international law in toto...|$|R
