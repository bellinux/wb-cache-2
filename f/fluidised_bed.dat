This study experimentally examines the hydrodynamics of packed and <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> in terms of pressure drop, bed expansion and minimum fluidisation velocity in tube sizes with inner diameters of 0. 8, 1. 2 and 17. 1 mm. Specifically the influence of the wall on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the beds was examined by changing the tube-to-particle diameter ratio. It was found that as the tube diameter reduces the bed voidage sharply increases leading to a reduction in the pressure drop across the bed. Also a pressure drop overshoot was observed at lower tube-to-particle diameter ratios which found to be associated with contact stresses due to wall friction...|$|R

The effects of the gas, liquid and solid properties and the characteristics of the apparatus (distributor quality) on the hydrodynamics have been studied. Two hydrodynamic data banks as well as experimental results have been used to study the influence of the coalescence inhibiting behaviour of liquids and to determine flow regime transitions and phase retentions. In heterogeneous regime, the ratio of the drift flux density to the superficial gas velocity tends to a limit, approximately independent on the liquid velocity in both fixed and <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds.</b> Two correlations of the drift flux have been developed by this analysis; the first of which is valid in the three-phase <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> and the other in the three-phase fixed beds...|$|R

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) {{is one of the}} short-medium term measures that can mitigate CO 2 emissions emitted from fossil fuels utilisation. Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising technology for CSS that can be integrated into the new and the current fleet of power plants. Biomass is a carbon neutral renewable source of energy that can replace fossil fuels. If the biomass is utilised as a fuel in oxy-fuel combustion it could lead even to negative CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{modelling}} {{the degradation of}} particles in gas-solid <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds.</b> Modelling is performed by using a coupled approach where the gas phase is treated as a continuum and the solid phase is represented by individual discrete particles, using the discrete element method (DEM). This approach {{makes it possible to}} access individual particle properties. By implementing new modelling techniques into the DEM framework, the individual particle degradation behaviour can be numerically described with high accuracy. The main interest is to understand more complex gas-solid systems as encountered e. g. in <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> which might contain numerous degrading particles. This work focuses on verifying and validating these sub-models to be able to obtain accurate information for further suggestions in operation and optimisation of dense particulate systems. Particle degradation is studied by means of thermophysical, thermochemical and mechanical aspects. Drying (thermophysical) is an energy intensive process which makes further research inevitable for further optimisation. Large particles during drying develop temperature and species gradients along their radius, affecting the product quality. The DEM has been used to monitor flow, particle and subparticle properties which have been found useful to control, operate and optimise such large particle drying processes. Pyrolytic (thermochemical) conversion of biomass in <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> represents a promising route for the production of biooil. This process has been modelled and studied under consideration of drying, shrinkage, segregation and entrainment. Breakage or mechanical degradation is often encountered in engineering applications and requires a much better process understanding. Therefore, a new discrete fragmentation method (DFM) has been developed to study breakage in dense particle systems such as <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> but also mills or crushers. Much reliable breakage information can be obtained to further optimise such systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Gas-solid <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> {{are widely}} used in chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, {{biochemical}} and powder industries. Particles used in gas-solid <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> often differ in size and/or density, thus have the tendency to segregate under certain operating conditions. The results of our earlier work show that the fate of segregation or mixing {{is determined by the}} combining effects of particle properties (e. g. size and density ratios), particle species composition and superficial gas velocity. For a given binary mixture, the transition from segregation to mixing occurred when the superficial gas velocity was increased over a critical value. In this study, the force analysis at particle scale, including particle-particle and particle-fluid interacting forces, has been carried out to investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive the transition. Specifically, the motion of particles was tracked individually by discrete element method (DEM), whilst the gas flow was modelled by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Experiments on the segregation and mixing of binary mixtures in gas-solid <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> were conducted for model validation. The results showed that as the superficial gas velocity increased, the turbulence of the gas flow increased which in turn induced the chaotic motion of particles. The particle-particle collision intensity dramatically increased and the collision forces led to an intense diffusion of particles and hence mixing of binary solids. The relationship between the force ratio (i. e. particle-fluid force to particle-particle force) and the transition from segregation to mixing has also been discussed. The simulation results agreed well with experimental measurements...|$|R
