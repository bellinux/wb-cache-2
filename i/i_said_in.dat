25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Mazur {{tells the}} tale of an {{otherwise}} brilliant calculus student of his who [...] "challenged almost everything <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> class but never questioned his calculator," [...] and {{who had come to}} believe that nine digits are all one needs to do mathematics, including calculating the square root of 23. The student remained uncomfortable with a limiting argument that 9.99... = 10, calling it a [...] "wildly imagined infinite growing process." ...|$|E
500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, Moretz stated in an interview, [...] "If I ever uttered one word that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> Kick-Ass, I would be grounded for years!

2500|$|... "I {{have never}} regretted what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> 'the last press conference.'

I think the episode was partially responsible for the much fairer treatment I received from the press {{during the next few}} years. From that point of view alone, it was worth it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, the {{president}} of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, [...] "We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). We {{were able to get}} some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They wanted to make it right. One thing <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> the meeting was, [...] "Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?" [...] "No, no, no, no!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{went over}} to Lauren and dragged her down to the water. I held her head under the water. She was {{struggling}} and she knocked me into the water. One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> my interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he was 6 years old, Barrie's next-older brother David (his mother's favourite) {{died two}} days before his 14th {{birthday}} in an ice-skating accident. This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, [...] "Is that you?" [...] "I {{thought it was the}} dead boy she was speaking to", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me. Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress.|$|E

2500|$|According to Norris, he {{was only}} read two {{paragraphs}} of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections {{to be made to}} those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made. In a May 2011 statement on his Presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed [...] "I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared". Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an [...] "academic discussion about Classical Greece and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation" [...] and that the [...] "presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made". Norris also spoke about the Magill profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the Sunday Independent, in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in [...] "horror", and that “it so completely misrepresents everything <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> the interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Frazier's {{testimony}} [...] adds, [...] "Just as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> {{the case}} of Mr. Curly, my initial feeling was, when I first heard about this, that the facts had not been established and we needed to be careful {{to make sure we}} understood the facts. As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was said in the presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
