25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> G2 must be connected and also <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a safety <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The ground pin is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> is made first when making a connection.|$|R
50|$|Some QFP {{packages}} have an Exposed Pad. The exposed pad is {{an extra}} pad underneath or {{on top of}} the QFP that may act as a <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> and/or as a heat sink for the package. The pad is typically 10 or more mm², and with the pad soldered down onto the ground plane, heat is passed into the PCB. This exposed pad also gives a solid <b>ground</b> <b>connection.</b> These type of QFP packages often have a -EP suffix (e.g. a LQFP-EP 64), or they have an odd number of leads, (e.g. a TQFP-101).|$|R

5000|$|Types II to IV are {{variants}} which {{attempt to}} overcome the main limitation of Type I, which is the reference to Earth {{at each end of}} the circuit. Types II-IV use the Signal Battery (SB) and Signal Ground (SG) lead in conjunction with the E&M wires. This improves noise immunity as the Signal Ground does not carry the same heavy currents as normal <b>Ground</b> <b>connections</b> and provides a low resistance return path for signaling. However, if the main <b>Ground</b> <b>connection</b> fails all Earth current may flow via the interface, causing signaling failure, hum and in extreme cases destruction of equipment.|$|R

50|$|A second {{advantage}} of differential TTL, when correctly terminated, {{is that the}} differential pair of wires forms a current loop. The driver sources a current from the power supply into one wire. This current passes along the wire to the receiver, through the termination resistor and back up the other wire, then back through the driver and down to ground. No net current is exchanged between the driver and receiver, which means {{that none of the}} signal current has to return through the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> (if there is one) between the two ends. This arrangement prevents the signal from injecting currents into the <b>ground</b> <b>connection,</b> which might upset other circuits attached to it.|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{is defined}} as the {{potential}} at a point referenced to ground. Unlike current, which can be trivially measured without a <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> at the measuring point, voltage requires a <b>ground</b> <b>connection.</b> In high-voltage installations, this results in the use of bulky and expensive voltage measurement transformers, or expensive and complex fiber-optic devices. However, since current can be measured at line potential, simply by using a current transformer around the conductor and transmitting the readings through wireless or a fiber-optic cable, the design of a device that can measure both the current and voltage wave forms while operating at the bus potential would be of great use in smart grid applications where many measurement points are required and the cost of classical, transformer or capacitive divider installations is prohibitive. In this project, an entirely novel voltage sensing device is proposed. The device operates at the high voltage bus potential and requires no direct <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> to operate. This enables an inexpensive device, not based on fiber-optic devices, that can be installed throughout the transmission and distribution system and forms a key component of a ne...|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} feature a ground pin that {{is longer than}} the line and neutral pins, ensuring that the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> is made first, and thus the safety ground is in place before line voltage {{is applied to the}} downstream equipment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A slot placed {{between the}} feed and the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> {{of a single}} shorted {{microstrip}} antenna (PIFA) in a two antenna system can produce a band-stop filter effect {{in one of the}} frequency bands where both antennas radiate at the same frequency, but have very high isolation. The slot forms a band-stop filter, creating a large group delay at certain frequencies at a particular anti-resonance frequency. This paper analyzes methods to tune the band-stop filter effect by adjusting the slot width and additional <b>ground</b> <b>connections.</b> The antenna geometry analyzed is similar to a two antenna system inside a mobile device where the first antenna with slots has both lower band and high band resonances (quad-band GSM or dual-band LTE) and the second antenna is a wide-band single frequency antenna at LTE/ 3 G/WiMAX.
