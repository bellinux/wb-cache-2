5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E
5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built <b>into</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

50|$|Then-rural Rouse Hill was {{identified}} by Sydney's 1988 metropolitan strategy, Sydney <b>Into</b> <b>Its</b> Third Century, {{as an area}} for future development. Under the previous 1968 strategy, new Western Sydney suburbs could only be formed within the broad corridors formed by the suburban rail system. In approving Sydney <b>Into</b> <b>Its</b> Third Century, Planning Minister Bob Carr abolished this guideline: henceforth new areas such as Rouse Hill could be developed far from rail lines, provided space was left for future transport infrastructure.|$|R
5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the trench and dove <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E
