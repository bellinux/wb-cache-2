40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} umbilical and uterine artery Doppler {{in the second and}} third trimester on antenatal course, labor and delivery in a low-risk primigravid population. METHODS: Prospective recruitment of 1011 low-risk primigravidas with uterine and umbilical artery Doppler assessment at 22 - 24 weeks and 36 weeks. All mothers and infants were reviewed postnatally with a retrospective analysis of ultrasound and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Elevated uterine artery indices were associated with increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> threatened miscarriage, <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia (PET) and a higher incidence of fetal birth weight 95 th centile for gestation was associated with statistically <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants.

The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease.
