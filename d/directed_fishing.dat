40|$|This {{document}} is an Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (EA/RIR/IRFA) for a proposed regulatory amendment {{to modify the}} current interval of time allowed for determining the maximum retainable amount (MRA) of selected groundfish species that can be retained by a vessel in the non-American Fishery Act (AFA) trawl catcher processor (C/P) sector. Non-AFA trawl C/Ps operating in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) {{are those that are}} not listed aw AFA C/Ps at 50 CFR 679. 4 (l) (2) (i). This proposed action would change MRA regulations located at 50 CFR 679. 20 (e) that establish the calculation method and MRAs for groundfish species that are closed to <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> by increasing the interval of time each vessel in this sector would have to retain the MRA specified in regulation. These modifications also would apply when the non-AFA C/Ps participate in any Community Development Quota (CDQ) fishery in which MRAs are used to limit retention of the selected groundfish species. MRAs are the primary tool used by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to regulate the catch of species closed to <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> during a fishing year. MRA regulations located at 50 CFR 679. 20 (e) establish the calculation method and MRA percentages for groundfish species that are closed to <b>directed</b> <b>fishing.</b> The MRA is calculated {{as a percentage of the}} retained amount of species closed to <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> relative to the retained amount of basis species or species groups open for <b>directed</b> <b>fishing.</b> Table 11 in 50 CFR 679 (see Appendix 2) lists retainable percentages for BSAI groundfish species.

40|$|Northern cod, {{comprising}} {{populations of}} Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) off southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland, supported major fisheries {{for hundreds of}} years.

The Canadian government closed the <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> for northern cod in July 1992, but even after a decade-long offshore moratorium, population sizes remain historically low. Here we show that, up until the moratorium, the life history of northern cod continually shifted towards maturation at earlier ages and smaller sizes. Because confounding effects of mortality changes and growth-mediated phenotypic plasticity are accounted for in our analyses, this finding strongly suggests fisheries-induced evolution of maturation patterns in the direction predicted by theory. We propose that fisheries managers could use the method described here as a tool to provide warning signals about changes in life history before more overt evidence of population decline becomes manifest...|$|E

40|$|Many {{stocks of}} Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{on both sides}} of the North Atlantic are {{currently}} at much reduced levels of biomass, but this situation is not in all instances the result of long, continuous decline. Most Northwest Atlantic stocks declined to low levels during the 1970 s, but increased during the 1980 s before declining even more severely during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Several of these stocks have shown little recovery despite severe restrictions on <b>directed</b> <b>fishing.</b> Many stocks in the Northeast Atlantic have experienced sustained increases and sustained decreases, but generally not in concert. Among-stock comparisons illustrate that fishing has played a dominant role in the dynamics of all cod stocks, but variability in climate has contributed to variability in recruitment, individual growth, and natural mortality. A cooling event during the last three decades of the twentieth century contributed to the rapid decline of several stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, and changes in life-history traits (growth rate, age and size at maturity) and in the biotic environment (predators and prey) may be contributing to recovery being slow...|$|E
40|$|ICES {{received}} this {{request from the}} European Commission: “During the last negotiations for fixing the fishing opportunities for EU vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks for 2013 and 2014, some Member States ’ delegates asked for a revision {{to the list of}} species of deep–sea sharks (Annex of Council Regulation (EU) No 1262 / 2012). In particular the request referred that black-mouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) be excluded from the list and low fin gulper shark (Centrophorus lusitanicus) be included in the list. The rationale behind the former case responds to consider the species as only demersal and not illustrative of deep-sea habitats. The latter regards to landings in ICES area IX, where the landings of other morphologically very similar species such as gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus) may have been underreported due to misidentification among both species. Concerning deep-sea sharks, the main commercial species are considered depleted and no <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> should take place. The Council agreed to fix TAC equal to zero since 2012, and, therefore, the content of the list of species of deep-sea sharks is deemed to be essential. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} summary of {{biological}} aspects and population trends of demersal finfish stocks in the southern Scotia Arc region of Antarctica. Information presented here, drawn largely from recent scientific research surveys, includes aspects of species composition, biomass and stock structure, reproduction and early life history, age, growth, and nat-ural mortality, and diet. Although Antarctic fish faunal groups overlap in the southern Scotia Arc, the region is dominated by species of low-Antarctic origin {{both in terms of}} biomass and number of species. Several basic biological parameters of the abundant fish species in the southern Scotia Arc are comparatively well known, though less so in the South Orkney Islands than the South Shetland Islands. These stocks suffered substantial declines as a result of commercial exploitation of mackerel ice fish, Champsocephalus gunnari, and marbled notothenia, Notothenia rossii, in the late 1970 s and mid 1980 s.

40|$|The {{development}} of a deep-sea fishery for aristeid shrimps off Brazil is reviewed from its early days in 2002. Descriptive data were collected by observers on board 75 <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> trips conducted in the study period, {{with a total of}} over 15, 000 monitored trawls. An incipient fishing phase took place between No-vember 2000 and October 2002, when aristeid shrimps were occasionally reported in the bycatch of operations mostly targeting the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). After that, a directed fishery was established for these resources. All nine vessels involved in this fishery (one national and eight chartered) concentrated on 11 limited grounds between 700 and 800 m deep and 18 °S and 34 °S. The main species caught between November 2002 and May 2007 was the "carabinero" Aristaeopsis edwardsiana (456, 710 kg), followed by the "moruno" Aristaeomorpha foliácea (121, 497 kg), and then the "alistado" Aristeus antillensis (27, 919 kg). The trawlers operate in conjunction, such that the total area of each fishing ground was swept at least twice. This harvest pattern substantially reduced "carabinero" catch rates from 14 kg hour- 1 in the first sampled trimester to 4 kg hour- 1 in the last. Despite the inferred biomass reduction of this species, the fishery has continued without a formal management plan...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} is an Environmental Assessment (EA) {{of the potential}} impacts of issuing an exempted fishing permit (EFP) to exempt vessels engaged in <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> for pollock and operating under a salmon bycatch reduction intercooperative agreement (ICA) from salmon savings area closures. The purpose of the project is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a “voluntary rolling hot spot ” (VRHS) salmon bycatch management system developed by the Bering Sea pollock harvesting cooperatives as a mechanism for identifying areas of elevated salmon bycatch during the course of the Bering Sea pollock season and reducing pollock fishing activity within those areas. The bycatch management system to be evaluated is described in the “Salmon Bycatch Management Agreement 2006 – 2008 Bering Sea Pollock Fishery ” (the Intercooperative Agreement or ICA), a copy of which is attached. The goal of the project is to develop a Bering Sea pollock fishery salmon bycatch management system that quickly and efficiently adapts to changes in salmon bycatch patterns through the course of pollock fishing seasons, and that effectively reduces pollock fishing activity in areas of elevated salmon bycatch during years of relatively low, moderate, and high salmon bycatch incidence without imposing impracticable restrictions on the affected fleet. Our analysis found no significant impacts on the human environment for this action. [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] BSAI Salmon Bycatch EA/RIR/IRFA Executive Summar...|$|E
40|$|Catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is {{commonly}} used as an indicator for monitoring developments in stock size. To ensure proportionality between average CPUE and total stock size, two processes that should be accounted for are the degree of targeting behaviour of the fleet and the management-induced responses in fishing behaviour. We studied the effect of restrictive individual quotas and targeting behaviour on average CPUE in the Dutch beam trawl fleet. Fishing opportunities varied in time and across species due to changes in quotas. Using catch and effort data by fishing trip of the total fleet and haul-by-haul data from a reference fleet, targeting behaviour of the beam trawl fleet was quantified for sole and plaice, at various space and time scales. Sole was targeted on all scales examined, whereas plaice was only targeted on a micro-scale of 10 × 10 nautical miles. When sole quota restrictions were relaxed, the fleet increasingly targeted sole instead of plaice. Targeting indices for sole and plaice were negatively correlated. Our findings indicate that catch and effort data by fishing trip are sufficient to characterise targeting behaviour on a macro-scale, whereas haul-by-haul data are needed to quantify the targeting on a micro-scale (30 × 30 nautical miles). The micro-scale targeting index {{can be used to}} standardize macro-scale CPUE data for bias due to variations in <b>directed</b> <b>fishing</b> among local fishing grounds...|$|E

Snipefish (8 - 17 cm) were regularly found off Portugal, occasionally in large concentrations, but were absent from the Gulf of Cadiz. Off northern Portugal, snipefish were distributed along the outer shelf and upper slope, clearly separated from sardine (the most abundant species in the inner shelf) and partially overlapping with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), the most abundant species in the upper slope. Snipefish were most abundant in the outer shelf of south-western Portugal, preferentially distributed in large aggregations around the Canyon of Setubal and partially overlapping with the distribution of boarfish (Capros aper) and blue whiting (both abundant in the upper slope of south-western Portugal). Off southern Portugal snipefish were almost exclusively distributed in the outer shelf and were significantly smaller than in south-western (intermediate) and northern Portugal (large). Acoustic estimates of total snipefish biomass ranged between 176 – 504 thousand tonnes within the study period, with more than half off south-western Portugal.

40|$|<b>Directed</b> <b>fishing</b> {{effort for}} Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), their primary {{spawning}} grounds {{in the western}} Atlantic, has been prohibited since the 1980 s due to a precipitous decline of the spawning stock biomass. However, pelagic longlines targeted at other species, primarily yellowfin tuna and swordfish, continue to catch Atlantic bluefin tuna in the GOM as bycatch. Spatial and temporal management measures minimizing bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM will likely become important in rebuilding the western Atlantic bluefin stock. In order to help inform management policy and understand the relative distribution of target and bycatch species in the GOM, we compared the spatiotemporal variability and environmental influences on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of yellowfin (target) and bluefin tuna (bycatch). Catch and effort data from pelagic longline fisheries observers (1993 – 2005) and scientific tagging cruises (1998 – 2002) were coupled with environmental and biological data. Negative binomial models were used to fit the data for both species and Akaike’s Information Criterion (corrected for small sample size) {{was used to determine}} the best model. Our results indicate that bluefin CPUE had higher spatiotemporal variability as compared to yellowfin CPUE. Bluefin CPUE increased substantially during the breeding months (March-June) and peaked in April and May, while yellowfin CPUE remained relatively high throughout the year. In addition, bluefin CPUE was significantly higher in areas with negative sea surface height anomalies and cooler sea surface temperatures, which are characteristic of mesoscale cyclonic eddies.
