5|$|Ginetta, then {{seventeen}} years old, was already {{active in the}} resistance movement, delivering food coupons and clothing to Jews who were in hiding. Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning lady to steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall),</b> she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E
5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall.</b> The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became {{determined}} to join the military, despite being, at just under <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall,</b> too short to meet the Army's height requirement. He seduced a major who {{was attached to the}} San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{was born}} in 1871 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to wealthy parents, Eliza and Edward P. Howe, who owned a store {{and part of a}} {{wholesale}} business. Edward P. Howe, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, had been a captain with the Union Army in the Civil War and made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana State Senate as a Democrat before Louis' birth. Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would never grow to more than <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall.</b> Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E
5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall</b> when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the talent to play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|He was an {{enthusiastic}} athlete, playing soccer, rugby and baseball as a child. His passion was for basketball {{and though he}} stood only <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall</b> and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight. Bob McGill, Terry's physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School, felt he was better suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport. Fox had no desire for cross-country running, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach. He was determined to continue playing basketball, even if he was the last substitute on the team. Fox played only one minute in his grade-eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten. In grade 12, he won his high school's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall</b> and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|In January 1923, having {{passed the}} RAF {{entrance}} examination {{with a high}} mark, Whittle reported to RAF Halton as an Aircraft Apprentice. He lasted only two days: just <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall</b> and with a small chest measurement, he failed the medical. He then put himself through a vigorous training programme and special diet devised by a physical training instructor at Halton to build up his physique, only to fail again six months later, when {{he was told that}} he could not be given a second chance, despite having added three inches to his height and chest. Undeterred, he applied again under an assumed name and presented himself as a candidate at the No 2 School of Technical Training RAF Cranwell. This time he passed the physical and, in September that year, 364365 Boy Whittle, F started his three-year training as an aircraft mechanic in No. 1 Squadron of No. 4 Apprentices Wing, RAF Cranwell, because RAF Halton No. 1 School of Technical Training was unable to accommodate all the aircraft apprentices at that time.|$|E

50|$|Before the Civil War, the Sweeney firm {{made three}} {{enormous}} four-foot wide and nearly <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> <b>tall</b> cut leaded glass bowls, {{in order to}} showcase their wares. The bowls won prizes at exhibitions in New York and Philadelphia. In 1844 at least one was given to Senator Henry Clay, partly in gratitude for helping establish a tariff on foreign glassware. Over the next decades, two were destroyed in warehouse fires (including the one sent to Clay's estate at Ashland and used to baptize him in 1847). The third adorned Michael Sweeney's tomb in Wheeling's cemetery from 1875 until 1948, when it {{was moved to the}} Oglebay glass museum for safekeeping.|$|R
50|$|Blind Homer With His Student Guide is {{a bronze}} {{sculpture}} by Moses Jacob Ezekiel in {{the likeness of}} the blind poet Homer, author of the Iliad, accompanied by a student guide. Ezekiel completed the statue in 1907 on a commission from John Woodruff Simpson {{as a gift for}} Amherst College, his alma mater. For reasons unknown the gift was refused, and Thomas Nelson Page, a Virginia alumnus who was active in the UVA Alumni Association, stepped in to secure the gift of the statue to UVa instead. Ezekiel completed the work in his Rome studio and donated a <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> <b>tall</b> black marble pedestal upon which the statue was originally installed.|$|R
500|$|Constance Parkin {{was born}} in 1906 in the hamlet of Miram, near Nhill in western Victoria. The family moved to Melbourne in 1920, where she {{completed}} her schooling at Genazzano convent in the suburb of Kew. Constance was short, just under <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall,</b> and had dark hair. She trained between 1925 and 1929 at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne. Over the summer of 1925–1926 the Gallery held a competition for its students, who were asked to paint [...] "holiday subjects"; Constance won the prize for a landscape. The competition was judged by artist George Bell, who would have a continuing influence over her artistic career.|$|E
500|$|Daoíz {{entered the}} Royal School of Artillery at Segovia as a cadet on 10 February 1782 and {{graduated}} as an ensign on 9 February 1787.

[...] After graduation Daoíz was assigned to the Real Regimiento de Artillería (Royal Regiment of Artillery) at Puerto de Santa Maria. He was able to use a considerable private income from property and farms owned by his family around Gibraltar to supplement his official salary.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{married in}} 1891, and the {{marriage}} was not a happy one. [...] According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in Rarebit Fiend as [...] "a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding". [...] McCay was a short man, barely <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> (...) <b>tall.</b> [...] He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. [...] Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in Rarebit Fiend. [...] Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay's part {{for a sense of}} smallness. [...] McCay's brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.|$|E

500|$|McCay stood barely <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> (...) <b>tall,</b> {{and felt}} {{dominated}} by his wife, who {{was nearly as}} tall as he was. McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour. [...] About a decade separated the couple's ages: Winsor was 24 and Maude only 14 when they married. Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay's birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenage girl. Maude was also notably age-conscious, as she preferred her grandchildren to call her [...] "Nan" [...] instead of [...] "Grandma" [...] and also dyed her hair as she got older. The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker. Neither spouse got along well with the other's mother.|$|E
500|$|Nearly a {{year later}} on May 5, 1951, the Nimrod computer—created by {{engineering}} firm and nascent computer developer Ferranti—was presented at the Festival of Britain, and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled. Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively {{to play the game}} of Nim; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or [...] "reverse" [...] form of the game. The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> <b>tall.</b> It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, [...] "Nimatron", designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World's Fair. [...] "Nimatron" [...] had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton. The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games. Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it.|$|E

50|$|Ford {{trained for}} the 1906 Boston Marathon under the {{guidance}} of the noted athletic trainer Frank “Tad” Gormley, beginning in the previous December with long walks, and only started running in February. Less than two weeks before the race Ford did a trial run of 22 ½ miles, mainly on the Marathon course, which he completed in 2:14. <b>Five</b> <b>foot</b> <b>tall</b> and weighing 113 ½ pounds, Ford was in fourteenth place in the Marathon race at the five-mile checkpoint in South Framingham, but worked his way up the field through a strong headwind and caught the leader, David Kneeland, at Charlesgate East, {{less than a mile from}} the finish. After a heavily contested battle with Kneeland, Ford finished in a time of 2:45:45, six seconds ahead of Kneeland. This would remain the closest Boston Marathon finish until 1971.|$|R
