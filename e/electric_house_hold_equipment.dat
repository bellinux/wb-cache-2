Though the recently published draft standard prEN 12354 - 5 gives a framework for the prediction of the structure-borne sound as caused by this type of sources, there is still a lot to be studied and developed. That is certainly the case for light weight building structures. Some possibilities to simplify the indicated models have been studied and experimental data has been gathered for <b>house</b> <b>hold</b> <b>equipment,</b> taking a washing machine as an example, applied both in a 'heavy' and in a 'light weight' building. Various possibilities to apply substitution methods to characterise such a source as structure-borne sound source have been tried and compared...|$|R

Moreover 46 % to 50 % of this energy is consumed in the resident buildings creating an enormous pressure on fulfilling the demand of electricity. As {{a result of this}} industries are burning gas, coal, oil etc. to harness energy which emits greenhouse gases causing environmental pollution. In this study we emphasis on redesigning these buildings in a way that utilizes Siting and structure design efficiency, Energy efficiency, Water efficiency, Materials efficiency, Indoor environmental quality enhancement, Operations and maintenance optimization, Waste reduction. By doing this we can abate the dependency on electric energy of those buildings to a great extent...|$|R

These could vary from personal care products to electronics, consumer durables, commodities, <b>house</b> <b>hold</b> <b>equipments,</b> beverages, automobiles, banking, insurance & other financial services, telecommunications services to name a few. In order to fulfill their quest for varied range of products and services organizations have {{to be geared to}} supply the consumer demand with consumer centric products and services. The consumer oriented products and services business is very competitive world wide. Therefore companies thrive for excellence in order to win over the consumer. In doing so the companies {{need to look at the}} total value chain to deliver the best product range at the lowest cost in quickest time. Sales and distribution is a very important aspect of a consumer centric organization's value chain. It is sales and distribution that makes the final contact with the end consumer who is considered the "king". Therefore creating an efficient and effective sales and distribution process is imperative for the success of an organization. Currently most consumer sales organizations in Sri Lanka practice a manual sales and marketing process which has many negative elements such as delays, inaccurate data, room for fraud, customer dissatisfaction to name a few. This is a big drawback for an organization when competing in the "best to market" era. However few organizations operate automated sales force systems but with certain limitations. The aim of this project was to develop an advanced Sales Force Automation System with real time data capturing and updating which will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the sales and distribution process by many leaps and bounds. Through this advanced Sales Force Automation System an organization could go to market with its product in a much shorter time span. Also it could improve it documentation and reporting with near zero mistakes. Sales Force Automation System will also help an organization in its decision making with accurate information in real time that will be a definite competitive advantage in the modern business world...|$|R

This is usually referred to as ‘Technology Transfer’ that the authors argue is a development concept, has been conceived by the politicians {{and the general public}} in sub-Saharan Africa as the ability to purchase or acquire technological equipment. Coupled with ‘‘globalization and economic liberation’’, this trend has become contagious to the point that any segment of unserviceable technological equipment finds its way into the sub-region…They are grouped as: vehicles, <b>house</b> <b>hold</b> machinery, industrial <b>equipment,</b> and many more. The authors have identified these unserviceable equipment as an inestimable source of raw materials where DC motors have been extracted (recovered) for the purpose of being reconfigured as DC motors for driving water pumps. (Sambwa et al., 2009). The pump itself can be retrieved from washing machines or radiators of the generating set engines.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{environmental}} issues that inflict aquatic life across the planet. Proper monitoring can be essential with preserving aquatic life and preventing any further damage. La Escola Politècnica Superior d'Enginyeria de Vilanova i la Geltrú (EPSEVG) and Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics (LAB) sponsored a project, called Project ECHO, {{that would make}} monitoring aquatic life easier and more efficient. This project’s main goal was improve the deployment of monitoring equipment process LAB already had in place. The most prevalent issues this project aims to solve is how much energy is wasted during deployment of monitoring equipment {{and how it is}} not guaranteed the monitoring equipment is working before deployment. In order to save energy and prevent a faulty deployment, a bidirectional communication system can be established that will receive the operating status of the monitoring equipment and be able to power it on and off. The approach of this project was to create a remote control to act as a bidirectional communication system. During the discussion of how to implement this system, it was decided that a <b>housing</b> to <b>hold</b> the <b>equipment</b> and power supply should both be researched and designed. The designed housing eases the deployment and retrieval of the system and protects monitoring equipment at the necessary depths. The result is a system that is interacted with wirelessly and can be easily deployed for a minimum period of 6 months...|$|R
