2500|$|Through formal fare {{reciprocity}} agreements, MARTA riders {{are able}} to transfer for free to the three other metro-Atlanta transit systems: Gwinnett County Transit, Cobb Community Transit and GRTA Xpress. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated {{that this is the}} case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006, 8888 daily passengers <b>transferred</b> <b>inbound</b> and 8843 <b>transferred</b> outbound). Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 <b>inbound</b> <b>transfers</b> but only 528 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound. Some have suggested that more people from the other systems may benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area. [...] However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in an equal number of transfers.|$|R

40|$|The new {{remote sensing}} {{experiment}} CRISTA-NF (Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere - New Frontiers) successfully {{participated in the}} SCOUT-O 3 Tropical Aircraft Campaign in November and December 2005. CRISTA-NF operated aboard the high-altitude research aircraft M- 55 Geophysica. Mid-infrared spectra (4 - 15 mu m) were measured in the limb sounding geometry with high spatial resolution (250 m vertical sampling, 5 - 15 km along track sampling). Measurements were carried out during <b>transfer</b> <b>flights</b> between Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and Darwin, Australia, as well as during several local flights near Darwin. Water vapor volume mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were derived from the CRISTA-NF radiance measurements by utilizing a rapid radiative transfer forward model and the optimal estimation retrieval approach. CRISTA-NF water vapor measurements below the hygropause have a total retrieval error of 15 - 40 % (i. e. root mean square of accuracy and precision). The systematic terms are dominating in the retrieval error budget. The contributions of a priori information to the retrieval results are less than 5 - 10 %. The vertical resolution of the observations is about 250 - 500 in when permitted by instrument sampling. In this paper we present first results for three <b>transfer</b> <b>flights</b> of the campaign. Being generally in good agreement with corresponding ECMWF operational analyzes, the CRISTA-NF measurements show significantly higher variability and local structures in the upper tropospheric water vapor distributions.
