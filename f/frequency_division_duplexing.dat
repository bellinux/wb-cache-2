50|$|FDMA is {{distinct}} from <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD). While FDMA allows multiple users simultaneous access to a transmission system, FDD refers to how the radio channel is shared between the uplink and downlink (for instance, the traffic {{going back and forth}} between a mobile-phone and a mobile phone base station). Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is also distinct from FDMA. FDM is a physical layer technique that combines and transmits low-bandwidth channels through a high-bandwidth channel. FDMA, on the other hand, is an access method in the data link layer.|$|E

30|$|The {{two layers}} in the IEEE 802.16 {{protocol}} stack are the physical layer, which transfers raw data, and the MAC layer, which supports the physical layer {{by ensuring that}} the radio resources are used efficiently. The three duplex modes in the physical layer with OFDMA are Time <b>Division</b> <b>Duplex</b> (TDD), <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplex</b> (FDD), and Half-duplex <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplex</b> (H-FDD). The TDD is the most attractive duplex mode because of its flexibility. In addition, the modulation methods, that is {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (QPSK), 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM), or 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64 QAM), and the associated coding rate for data transmission are selected according to the channel quality, that is, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).|$|R
50|$|The LTE {{specification}} provides downlink peak {{rates of}} 300 Mbit/s, uplink peak rates of 75 Mbit/s and QoS provisions permitting a transfer latency {{of less than}} 5 ms in the radio access network. LTE {{has the ability to}} manage fast-moving mobiles and supports multi-cast and broadcast streams. LTE supports scalable carrier bandwidths, from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz and supports both <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD) and time-division duplexing (TDD). The IP-based network architecture, called the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) designed to replace the GPRS Core Network, supports seamless handovers for both voice and data to cell towers with older network technology such as GSM, UMTS and CDMA2000. The simpler architecture results in lower operating costs (for example, each E-UTRA cell will support up to four times the data and voice capacity supported by HSPA).|$|E

30|$|However, MCP {{comes at}} the cost of {{increased}} signaling and infrastructural overheads. On the downlink of cellular systems operating in <b>Frequency</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Duplexing</b> (FDD) mode, the overheads of MCP are related to the inherent need for Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter of multiuser MIMO systems and also to the distributed nature of collaborative BS processing [5].

UEs are expected to handle both FDD on the macro cell link and TDD on the small cell link. While this feature is technically challenging to perform with state-of-the-art equipment, discussions are under way in 3 GPP to make joint FDD-TDD operation via carrier aggregation (CA) or dual connectivity technically possible [43].|$|E
30|$|Cognitive radios {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to improve the spectrum use and to adapt the transmission scheme to optimize the sharing of the available bandwidth, which leads to important constraints on the hardware components, located on the physical layer [1].

30|$|Coordinated multi‐point (CoMP) {{transmission}} {{has drawn}} broad attention recently [1, 2]. When all the coordinated base stations (BSs) share both data and channel information, coherent cooperative transmission, {{also known as}} joint transmission, can provide high spectral efficiency for cellular systems if the BSs can obtain high‐quality channels. This however requires large feedback overhead for <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD) CoMP systems. Though CoMP has various forms, depending on the information shared among the BSs, we refer coherent cooperative transmission as CoMP {{in the rest of}} the paper for simplicity.|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} {{for improving the}} performance of DF in-band multi-antenna relays through resource optimization. Our main resource optimization tool is diversity in channels across frequency subcarriers and multiple users. The process of utilizing this diversity at relays is called scheduling at relays. In the spirit of this approach, we conducted indoor field trials at 2.6 GHz and full 20 MHz bandwidth using multiple antenna relays (MIMO relays) to characterize the indoor channel frequency response. We also performed data rate evaluation based on channel quality feedback in <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD) operation and interference-free scenario.|$|E
30|$|Considering <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FDD)-based C-RANs, {{acquiring}} channel {{state information}} (CSI) at the CP requires downlink antenna training and uplink CSI feedback from users. Antenna training and CSI feedback consume precious time and frequency resources which increase {{with the number}} of RRHs involved in user service. Considering that the available time and frequency resources are limited, those overheads might be a bottleneck for RRH cooperation in an FDD-based C-RAN where a large number of RRHs are deployed for user service. In [16, 17], RRH cooperation strategies are developed to reduce the overhead required for acquiring CSI at the CP.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a novel metric {{for determining the}} spatial decorrelation between the up- and down-link wireless bearers in <b>frequency</b> <b>division</b> <b>duplex</b> (FDD) networks. This metric has direct relevance to smart or adaptive antenna array base-station deployments in cellular networks, which are known to offer capacity enhancement when compared to fixed coverage solutions. In particular, the results presented were obtained from field trial measurement campaigns for both urban and rural scenarios, with the observations having {{a direct impact on}} the choice of down-link beamforming architecture in FDD applica-tions. Further, it is shown that significant spatial decorrelation can occur in urban deployments for bearer separations as small as 5 MHz. Results are presented in terms of both instantaneous characteristics as well as time averaged estimates, thus facilitating the appraisal of smart antenna solutions in both packet and circuit switched networks.
