50|$|The vault of the Sternberg chapel is {{designed}} into an eight-pointed star, {{which was to}} be found on the shield of the Sternberg family. 7 suspended ribs are coming out of the star. They are connected deep beneath the vault with a <b>decorative</b> <b>stud</b> with figural motives, where again we can see the Sternberg sign. The belonging of the chapel was therefore properly emphasized.On the southern wall near the floor tiles are located various niches. One of them, a wide and doubled one is a so-called sedilia - the seat for the priest. A wide segmented arched niche to the right was originally closed with a grating and served as a depository of worship utensils. Similarly narrow, tall and tapered side niche was used for special items - e.g. candles.The original entrance to the chapel was in the north and it was possible to enter directly to the right nave of the church. In the 18th century there were two altars in the church, one on each side - the altar of St. Barbara and St. Catherine.On {{the eastern side of the}} chapel stood the main altar on a stone Gothic-profiled table, still preserved today. Wooden architecture that was once depicted on it unfortunately disappeared. Since the beginning of the 17th century, i.e. since the reconstruction of the chapel by Ladislav von Sternberg, there were two other altars next to the main one, which however did not lie on stone tables; they were made fully of wood. These altars were not built next to the walls, they were touching them on the sides, so that one stood slightly in front of the main altar and next to the northern wall. Second, inversely, on the oppositeside, the right side to the south wall.After the restoration in the early 17th century the chapel only had painting decoration. The counting of paintings first occurred in 1765. At that time, on the epistle side hung Holy Family in black framework and underneath another painting of Our Lady of Sorrows. On the gospel side (left) was located a large painting of Saint Joseph on his deathbed, next to which stood Jesus and Mary with angels. At the entrance was hung a painting of Saint Rosalia.Since the beginning of the 18th century were in the chapel also stored sculptures used in religious processions. Next to the main altar were located large sculptures of the Virgin Mary with Jesus and Saint Sebastian the martyr. Elsewhere are stored statues of the Immaculate Conception, St. Adalbert, bishop and martyr and St. Isidore. There was also a large sculpture of 12 Apostles, composed of three parts.Substantial parts of the church murals were preserved until today. They are the Lobkowicz and Sternberg signs with the relevant inscriptions, which decorate the northern wall. Then there remained several figures of the Saints on the western and southern wall, which show the original dedication of the chapel. There is the Virgin Mary, St. Vaclav and St. Barbara. The paintings are life-size, however they are faded and neglected and are waiting for a thorough restoration.|$|E
5000|$|The firehouse {{consists}} of a five-story building and an adjacent seven-story watchtower. These two elements are separated by a slender, semicircular turret with a conical roof which rises the full height of the building, while two similar turrets on each wing lend the facade {{a strong sense of}} unity. On the ground floor, serving as the main entrance, is [...] "one of the boldest and most mellifluously carved arches" [...] in Brooklyn, through which the fire engines once drove. A second, receding arch is located {{on the opposite side of}} the building, high in the tower. <b>Decorative</b> <b>studs</b> above the tower arch and cylindrical holes around the tops of the turrets enhance the overall sense of boldness. The building is constructed of orange brick with terra cotta detailing, held up by granite with red sandstone trim, while the pyramidal roof is tiled in red and trimmed with copper. The overall color scheme has been characterized as [...] "both subtle and ingenious." [...] Overall, the building is an example of the New York Branch of the Chicago architectural school.|$|R
50|$|Although in many {{instances}} collars are worn solely by a submissive partner {{in a relationship with}} a dominant, in some cases the dominant partner or an unattached person may also wear a collar. People across social layers can now be seen wearing casual collars, purely for fashion. Collars used for fashion are worn by both men and women, and made from various materials such as soft leather, cotton, neoprene, nylon etc. often in bright friendly colors but varying from bright, neutral into darker colors. The lining ranges from bare leather to lambskin, to faux fur. The collar most often has a buckle either in black, nickel or brass design, but snaps and velcro closures are also found. Adornments range from plain collars, to <b>decorative</b> stitching, to <b>studs</b> of all kinds to gems to ruby domes and gemocites etc. Attachments are common too, but often discreet, e.g. a thin black D-ring in front of the collar.|$|R
50|$|The Udu is {{the most}} common and popular drum. This {{instrument}} is also known as Nkwa, Egwe, or Egede, depending {{on the part of the}} country.These drums are not talking drums. Although they produce a sound which is tonal, syncopated, and generally melodious - they have never been known as talking drums and are not spiritual in nature or usage. Igbo people speak. The body of the drum is usually constructed from a hollowed out pear or cotton tree which is very durable yet malleable. The drum is then covered with antelope or cow skin. The hide is fastened tightly to the top and bottom of the instrument with seven to eight studs, and with rope in a <b>decorative</b> manner. The <b>studs</b> are able to be adjusted for tuning purposes and sound accommodation. If the studs are tightened a high pitch is emitted. The opposite effect is heard if the studs are loosened. Typically, more than one Igba is played by several drummers at a time. The drum can be played by using four fingers from each hand. The right hand is used to beat the head of the drum, and the left hand is used to stop the vibration. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the edge of the drum head,a low pitch will be emitted. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the center, then a higher pitch will be emitted. The Igba can also be played using a curved drum stick, which can be found wrapped in fiber to produce a soft sound,or “naked” to produce hard sound. This drum is very versatile and is usually played during celebrations, festivals, weddings, male and female rites of passage, and sometimes funerals.|$|R
40|$|Cultural and {{literary}} critics {{have long been}} occupied with deciphering the meaning of things. For Karl Marx, for instance, things are disguised social relations, "hieroglyphics" that {{appear to have a}} language of their own only because they disguise the secret of their production. 1 For poststructuralists, things are signs, sharing with language all the ambiguity and slippage that writing brings to signification, and available metaphorically in fiction as indexes of the real world from which they are drawn. In a New Historicist lexicon, they exist alongside texts as part of a cultural context to be reconstructed. More recently, however, new developments in "thing theory" and the study of materiality have suggested that things may be most important because they occasion different forms of reading from texts or signs. In his 1986 introduction to the Social Life of Things, Arjun Appadurai broke conceptual ground by suggesting that things are freer to move between categories of meaning (of the gift, of the commodity) than Marx had imagined. This analysis helped to introduce a contemporary perspective in which things themselves seem to talk above or below the language of their social situation. Thus, for Bill Brown, Susan Stewart, John Plotz, Elaine Freedgood, and others speaking up for the realm of material studies within the discipline of literature, ways of what Freedgood terms "readings things" in texts, and of reading texts as things, are still to be developed. 2 The value of retraining ourselves as readers is advanced by all of these critics, who pick up on Appadurai's general point that history, subjectivity, and consciousness happen in contact with surfaces and textures, even when these surfaces and textures are the products of social context in the first place. "The story of the thing," argues Brown, "is the story of a changed relation to the human subject. " 3 As Brown's use of the word "story" suggests, there is a strategic aspect to such an approach, a provisional willingness to use what Freedgood describes as "a strong literalizing metonymy [to] 'start' fictional objects into historical life... against the grain of the kinds of allegorical meaning we already know how to find, read, and create. " 4 More definitively, though, thing theory suggests that if we overhaul our whole way of reading both texts and objects, we might get beyond the dichotomies of sign and essence; depth and surface; metaphor and metonym, which are distinctions that things by definition refuse to uphold. 5 The best engagements with materiality, argues Plotz, look beyond the realm of symbolic circulation to the "limit cases" where an object's "meaning" ends and its "materiality" begins. 6 In the realm of texts this involves the opportunity to approach texts (as words and paper and print) as part of the ungovernably real, practical relations of the subject with the material world. This essay is something of a thought experiment in seeing where such a corrective might lead in terms of one work, Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford (1851 – 1853). Cranford was first published as a series of stories under Charles Dickens's editorship in Household Words before being brought out as the single volume of what can now be described loosely as a novel lacking conventional plot or character development. Cranford lends itself to an investigation of materiality partly because of this structure, and its appearance in Household Words, a journal in which many pieces draw their readers' attention to everyday surfaces, and partly because it is a text in which the objects of Victorian village life—candle lighters, rubber bands, <b>decorative</b> garters, apples <b>studded</b> with cloves, lavender bags, red and green silk, Italian lace collars, butterfly brooches—seem to come to life in place of the characters who would normally drive such a plot. The current upturn of interest in Cranford, long Gaskell's most popular work, but much less a focus of twentieth-century appreciation than her probing novels of social realism, reflects a new sense of it being possible to [...] . ...|$|R
