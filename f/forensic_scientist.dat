5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist.</b> Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

25|$|The CIB hired renowned <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist</b> Henry Lee (<b>forensic</b> <b>scientist)</b> {{to examine}} the {{physical}} evidence. Dr. Henry Lee was famous for defending O.J.

Dr. Henry Lee and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that the casings were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though the casings had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had cleaned up the firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until the casings were found.|$|E

25|$|In October 2007, Michigan State University <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist</b> David Foran {{claimed that}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{evidence showed that}} the remains found beneath the cellar floor in Crippen's home were not those of Cora Crippen. This research was based on genealogical identification of three matrilineal relatives of Cora Crippen (great-nieces, located by U.S. genealogist Beth Wills), whose mitochondrial DNA haplotype was compared with DNA extracted from a slide with flesh taken from the torso in Crippen's cellar.

25|$|Six {{forensic}} experts {{hired by}} Mrs. Duggan examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A forensic pathologist suggested that bruises on Duggan's {{hands and arms}} were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan police, and Alan Bayle, a <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist,</b> suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or similar, while Canning wrote that he found nothing {{to suggest that the}} cars had made contact with Duggan. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.|$|E
40|$|In many cases, <b>forensic</b> <b>scientists</b> rely on {{measurements}} as a {{basis for}} their opinions. In the past, <b>forensic</b> <b>scientists,</b> testifying about such measurements, have often presented the court with a single point value. The problem is that there is an unavoidable and an inherent element of uncertainty in every measurement. The metrology has developed several methods of quantifying a measurement’s margin of error or uncertainty. By using these methods, the testifying expert can put the trier in a much better position to determine the appropriate evidentiary weight of the measurement. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the problem of uncertainty in forensic science and in particular uncertainty in measurements by <b>forensic</b> <b>scientists.</b> In this paper, the problem of uncertainty is described in a relatively non-technical way. In other words, the discussion will focus on concepts rather than on analytical analysis...|$|R

25|$|On 7 September 2007, another <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist,</b> Jonathan Whitaker, gave {{evidence}} that semen matching swabs taken from Angus Sinclair was found mixed with cells {{with the same}} DNA profile as Helen Scott, on a coat belonging to Helen Scott. He also told the court how brothers and sisters of Sinclair's dead brother-in-law, Gordon Hamilton, had provided samples for DNA testing, and {{that the results of}} these tests had been compared with the semen found in the bodies of the victims. He explained that the results obtained are what he would expect, if semen found in the victims had come from a brother of the surviving Hamiltons. Whitaker was the final witness in the Crown case.|$|E
25|$|The samples {{collected}} in 1987 were later {{subjected to a}} DNA analysis, providing the evidence for his arrest warrant. On November 30, 2001, Ridgway was at the Kenworth Truck factory, where {{he worked as a}} spray painter, when police arrived to arrest him. Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of murdering four women nearly 20 years earlier after first being identified as a potential suspect, when DNA evidence conclusively linked semen left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police. The four victims named in the original indictment were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims—Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes—were added to the indictment after a <b>forensic</b> <b>scientist</b> identified microscopic spray paint spheres as a specific brand and composition of paint used at the Kenworth factory during the specific time frame when these victims were killed.|$|E
