5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very <b>high-performance</b> <b>computer,</b> one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

In his 1983 speech, he called upon the scientists and engineers of the United States to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete. SDI was an important part of his defense policy, intended to end MAD as a nuclear deterrence strategy. A wide array of advanced weapon concepts, including lasers, particle beam weapons and ground- and space-based missile systems were studied, along with various sensor, command and control, and <b>high-performance</b> <b>computer</b> systems that would be needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the entire globe.
