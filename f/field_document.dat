40|$|In both {{developed}} and developing countries poor performance of head teachers is detrimental to school effectiveness, with consequent economic costs amounting to billions of dollars every year. These costs are perhaps particularly keenly felt in developing countries, where demand for a workforce that is proficient in globally relevant competencies is especially acute, but where the effective school leadership that can help to deliver this educated workforce is especially patchy. One of the contributing factors to this poor performance {{is a lack of}} structured leadership development programmes. This study, therefore, explores the factors pertinent to effective school leadership development programmes in a resource poor education system, taking Cameroon as its example. The study combines a review of the academic literature with <b>field</b> <b>document</b> analysis evidence, structured interviews with head teachers and teachers, and a Leadership and Management Development Questionnaire (LMDQ) study. The results in particular indicate that the central educational agencies, schools and school leaders recognized the importance of ensuring that central policies and support, schools’ internal policies, and their in-service development opportunities for aspiring head teachers, are closely aligned with international best practice, particularly through the establishment of a structured leadership development programme targeted at aspiring head teachers, and aimed at combining governance skills with a more global outlook. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} review Scandinavian research on tweens as consumers from the years 1990 - 2007. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 35 studies were examined. Bronfenbrenner's bio-ecological perspective was used to depict what parts of children's lives had been investigated. The theory highlights different contexts and analytical levels in children's environments that may influence their consumer behavior. Findings – Scandinavian research has mainly focused on the individual child as a consumer and on interpersonal relations. The societal transformations that gradually changes the Scandinavian countries seem to have been less investigated. In addition, there is a lack of Scandinavian consumer research on interaction between different contexts, such as parents and school, which may influence children's consumer behavior. Research limitations/implications – This article has not critically reviewed each specific investigation in the field, but focused on the spread of aggregated Scandinavian research on tweens as consumers. Practical implications – A more composite picture of consumption patterns among Scandinavian tweens is provided, which may be used as a guideline for educators, marketers and other professionals that interact with this age group. Originality/value – Few attempts have been made to obtain a composite picture of Scandinavian consumer research on tweens. This question is of particular importance in times when the discourse of children's role in consumer society is changing, in order to understand the implications for future theoretical and empirical development in this dynamic <b>field.</b> <b>Document</b> Options: Content access View HTML View PDF (270 kb) References References (49) Further reading Related items Key readings Marked list Add to marked list: Session Bookmark & share           Reprints & permissions   Reques...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Vigabatrin (VGB) is an anti-epileptic {{medication}} {{which has}} been linked to peripheral constriction of the visual <b>field.</b> <b>Documenting</b> the natural history associated with continued VGB exposure is important when making decisions about the risk and benefits associated with the treatment. Due to its speed the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) has become the algorithm of choice when carrying out Full Threshold automated static perimetry. SITA uses prior distributions of normal and glaucomatous visual field behaviour to estimate threshold sensitivity. As the abnormal model is based on glaucomatous behaviour this algorithm has not been validated for VGB recipients. We aim to assess the clinical utility of the SITA algorithm for accurately mapping VGB attributed field loss.
