5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game indoors, the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being {{more or less the}} number that could <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> {{the morning of}} 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison {{in the minds of}} many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noire was {{developed}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. Windows copies of the game are distributed on two DVD discs, while Xbox 360 copies are distributed on three; the PlayStation 3 version fits onto one Blu-Ray Disc. A total of 16 cases—the game's form of missions that advance the game's narrative—were removed from {{the final version of}} the game as they would not have <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> one Blu-ray Disc; while five of these cases were later released as downloadable content, eleven cases from the departments Bunko and Burglary were completely removed.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy uses a dual-layer disc {{to allow}} all three games to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> a single disc {{due to the}} size of the game data.

Nintendo offered a free repair for owners who experienced this issue.|$|E
5|$|The T30 HMC was {{originally}} conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the Armored Force's requirement for an assault gun to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units. The Ordnance Department design {{was based on}} the M3 Half-track in order that it could be brought into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.|$|E

It was also designed first to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> the iPhone's smaller screen—a lesson learned from Hitman Go, which had been designed for tablets. The Square Enix team collaborated with Tomb Raider brand owners Crystal Dynamics to fit the series license. The player-character outfits, in particular, were informed by this exchange.|$|E
5|$|William's eldest sibling, Elizabeth Ann, {{died at the}} age {{of seven}} during an epileptic <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> 7 September 1859, which may have contributed to Mary Jane's depression. The other two children, Joseph Henry and Mary Jane, both died before 1889. William was raised {{initially}} in Dudley by his maternal uncle, Edward Henley, and by 1871 he was enrolled at the Blue Coat charity school in Stourbridge.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{began making}} {{recordings}} in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras {{to use only}} principal instruments, placed {{as close to the}} recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann and Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal– his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's España was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham {{also had}} doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had {{for some time}} been {{suffering}} from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing. He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> the Wednesday before the game. Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle {{three weeks before the}} final, travelled on the Thursday {{with the rest of the}} team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. VI {{had a brief}} {{overseas}} career. One of {{the early}} units was experimentally fitted to a Hurricane Mk. IIc, and {{this led to a}} production of a single flight of such designs starting in July 1942. These conversions were given such a low priority that they were not complete until the spring of 1943. Some of these aircraft were sent to Calcutta where they claimed a number of Japanese bombers. An experimental <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> Hawker Typhoon iA R7881 was carried out, with the system packed into a standard underwing drop tank. This was available in March 1943 and underwent lengthy trials lasting into 1944, but nothing came of this work.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network. The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E

5|$|The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 {{to build}} and test prototypes of the {{real-time}} strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named {{after one of the}} test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.|$|E
