5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>with</b> it.

S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
