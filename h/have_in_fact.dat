5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E

25|$|It follows that, in general, the {{defenders}} of the new calendar hold the view that in localities where the Church's episcopal authority has elected to adopt the new calendar, but where some have broken communion with those implementing this change, it is those who have broken communion who <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> introduced the disunity, rather than the new calendar itself or those who have adopted it— although most would agree that attempts at various times to mandate {{the use of the}} new calendar through compulsion, have magnified the disunity.|$|E
25|$|Denmark, Switzerland, Armenia and Poland are {{countries}} that have expressed interest in participating in future tournaments, but has so far (2017) not made any appearance. Denmark and Poland <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> exited FIB. Armenia wanted to come already to 2011, but wasn't allowed to, as the tournament format at the time only allowed twelve teams and several more wanted to come. Of the countries which still haven't taken part, at least India was also denied in 2011. Most probably also Lithuania. The reason for the 2011 tournament having only eleven teams, was a late cancellation from Australia, another country no longer an FIB member.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} is between Saints and USDHS / Cathedral, which has spanned many years. Since the early 1970s, a yearly 'Charity Bowl' (now called the 'Holy Bowl'), first hosted at Jack Murphy Stadium (Qualcomm Stadium) by Bob Hope, occasionally at Balboa Stadium, and now at Southwestern College Stadium, has been {{the highlight of the}} rivalry. The two schools' football teams <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> met in every season since the foundation of University High, except for 2007, when the game was cancelled as part of a county-wide cancellation of all high school sports during the October wildfires and was not rescheduled.|$|E
25|$|Eikon Basilike was {{published}} just after Charles I's execution, {{and the work}} portrayed him as a martyr. The piece was written with straightforward political aims, to stir up popular sentiment {{in support of the}} former monarch and to undermine the control of the Commonwealth government. The work proved so popular that there were 35 editions produced that year. Milton's approach was different from that of Eikon Basilike, which may <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been a composite work with John Gauden involved in ghostwriting: instead of appealing to popular sentiment, Milton's work was closely argued and tried to meet each of the points in the Eikon.|$|E
25|$|For some {{investigation}} teams {{this means that}} MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Warner Bros. {{acquired}} the Peanuts catalog from Paramount {{for an undisclosed}} amount of money.

25|$|Some modern {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves, in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity, reddish teeth and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf. This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed {{out the possibility of}} historical werewolves having been sufferers of hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe. People suffering from Down syndrome have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths. Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way {{is not part of the}} original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, for {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett in his season debut. In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Halladay was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to {{walk back to the}} dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given {{a clean bill of health}} for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the 2008 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of the Indians. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posted a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|Poe imitates many {{traditional}} [...] "Germanic" [...] elements in this tale. The most obvious {{example is the}} gloomy old castle, typical of Gothic fiction. The story also includes typical Gothic themes, which scholar Dawn Sova refers to as [...] "hints at secret obsessions and sins, foreboding prophecies, family rivalry". These Gothic conventions had been a staple of popular fiction in Europe and the United States for several decades by the time Poe utilized them. Considering the subtitle, [...] "A Tale in Imitation of the German", critics and scholars disagree if Poe may <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> intended the story as a satire or burlesque of the genre, purposely exaggerating {{the elements of the}} Gothic to be humorous. Other evidence is that all of the other three stories Poe published in 1832 ("The Duc de l'Omelette", [...] "A Tale of Jerusalem", and [...] "Bon-Bon") are comic tales written, as Poe said, [...] "intended for half banter, half satire". The story also uses irony as a form of humor: Despite the family's prophecy that [...] "the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing", the opposite occurs. The suggestion that [...] "Metzengerstein" [...] is purposefully written as a satire has been disputed, especially because of Poe's revisions throughout its many republications where he removed some of the more exaggerated material.|$|E
