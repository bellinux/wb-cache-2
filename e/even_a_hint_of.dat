[...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon".

The costs associated with such behavior are shared by both firms and individuals and can be large enough to even prevent the initiation of trade. Measurement of these costs is difficult because information is not available for transactions that fail to occur. We use a field experiment to identify opportunistic crime in a task that is important and relevant for trade: the delivery of mail. Without a reliable system for transporting goods, trade and on-line commerce is severely hampered. We subtly manipulate the content and information available in mail sent to households across neighborhoods that vary by income, and we detect high levels of shirking and stealing. Eighteen percent of the mail never arrived at its destination, and significantly more was lost if there was <b>even</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> something additional inside the envelope. Our results demonstrate the importance of transaction costs created by crime and that not all populations are equally affected. Middle income neighborhoods suffer the most...|$|R

40|$|In this project, I use {{computational}} modeling {{to study}} {{the ways in which}} organizations can benefit from uncertainty. In particular, my goal is to understand how organizations can capture opportunities to innovate, given that innovation depends on at least some level of uncertainty. This underlying assumption takes into account that the history of innovation is replete with stories of serendipities and lucky accidents. Two distinct processes that drive innovation, the discovery of new knowledge and the recombination of existing knowledge (Arthur, 2009), are both frequently sparked by chance events. A common thread in most—if not all—accounts of accidental innovation is that despite the element of surprise, the innovators knew they had stumbled upon something valuable. As Louis Pasteur famously said, “Chance favors the prepared mind. ” Chance, however, arises due to uncertainty, and given uncertainty, it is often unclear what constitutes a prepared mind. In an uncertain environment, the present and the future are often sufficiently decoupled such that organizations may not <b>even</b> have <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> what will come their way and how to be ready for it. As a first step in deconstructing this problem, I assume that in the context of innovation, the most prepared organizations are those that are stocked with the broadest and deepes...|$|R

Hare's strange prescience of the fatality that overshadowed these men had received its first verification in the sudden taking off of Snap Naab. The deep-scheming Holderness, confident that his strong band meant sure protection, sat and smoked and smiled beside the camp-fire. He had not caught <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> Snap Naab's suggested warning. Yet somewhere out on the oasis trail rode a man who, once turned from the saving of life to the lust to kill, would be as immutable as death itself. Behind him waited a troop of Navajos, swift as eagles, merciless as wolves, desert warriors with the sunheated blood of generations in their veins. As Hare waited and watched with all his inner being cold, he could almost feel pity for Holderness. His doom was close. Twice, when the rustler chief had sauntered nearer to the cabin door, as if to enter, Hare had covered him with the rifle, waiting, waiting for the step upon the threshold. But Holderness always checked himself in time, and Hare's finger eased its pressure upon the trigger.|$|E
6000|$|Popular science, {{like that}} of Mr. Blatchford, is in this matter as mild as old wives' tales. Mr. Blatchford, with colossal simplicity, {{explained}} to millions of clerks and workingmen that the mother is like a bottle of blue beads and the father is like a bottle of yellow beads; and so the child is like a bottle of mixed blue beads and yellow. He {{might just as well}} have said that if the father has two legs and the mother has two legs, the child will have four legs. Obviously it {{is not a question of}} simple addition or simple division of a number of hard detached [...] "qualities," [...] like beads. It is an organic crisis and transformation of the most mysterious sort; so that even if the result is unavoidable, it will still be unexpected. It is not like blue beads mixed with yellow beads; it is like blue mixed with yellow; the result of which is green, a totally novel and unique experience, a new emotion. A man might live in a complete cosmos of blue and yellow, like the [...] "Edinburgh Review"; a man might never have seen anything but a golden cornfield and a sapphire sky; and still he might never have had so wild a fancy as green. If you paid a sovereign for a bluebell; if you spilled the mustard on the blue-books; if you married a canary to a blue baboon; there is nothing in any of these wild weddings that contains <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> green. Green is not a mental combination, like addition; it is a physical result like birth. So, apart from the fact that nobody ever really understands parents or children either, yet even if we could understand the parents, we could not make any conjecture about the children. Each time the force works in a different way; each time the constituent colors combine into a different spectacle. A girl may actually inherit her ugliness from her mother's good looks. A boy may actually get his weakness from his father's strength. Even if we admit it is really a fate, for us it must remain a fairy tale. Considered in regard to its causes, the Calvinists and materialists may be right or wrong; we leave them their dreary debate. But considered in regard to its results there is no doubt about it. The thing is always a new color; a strange star. Every birth is as lonely as a miracle. Every child is as uninvited as a monstrosity.|$|E

40|$|The Galilean {{satellites}} influence radio {{emissions from}} the Jovian {{system in a}} variety of ways. The best and most familiar example of these is the Io control of decametric radiation discovered in 1964 by Bigg. Voyager observations of broadband kilometric radiation revealed a low-latitude shadow zone cast by the Io torus at frequencies between a few tens of kHz and about 1 MHz. Voyager also discovered narrowband kilometric radio emissions emanating from {{the outer edge of the}} torus. In this paper we will discuss expansions in the suite of satellite influences based on new observations by Galileo. These include the discovery of Ganymede's magnetosphere and evidence of radio emissions generated via mode conversion from upper hybrid waves in the frequency range of about 20 - 100 kHz. There is evidence that Ganymede may control some of the hectometric or low-frequency decametric radio emissions based on occultation measurements and statistical studies of radio emission occurrence as a function of Ganymede phase. Direction-finding measurements in the vicinity of Io suggest that a portion of the hectometric emissions may be generated near the lo L-shell. A rotationally modulated attenuation band in the hectometric emission appears to be the result of scattering at or near the Io L-shell where the waves propagate nearly parallel to the magnetic field. There is <b>even</b> <b>a</b> tantalizing <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Europa connection to the source of narrowband kilometric radiation...|$|R

But it was the girl's beauty which made Anne give a little gasp--a beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere.
