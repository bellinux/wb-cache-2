50|$|On large {{industrial}} machines, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is typically {{located on the}} panel, and possibly in several {{other areas of the}} machine. Often, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers. For fail-safe operation, the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is a normally closed switch which ensures that a broken wire will neither accidentally activate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> nor prevent it from being activated.|$|R
40|$|In working environments {{with large}} manipulators, {{accidental}} collisions can cause severe personal injuries and can seriously damage manipulators, necessitating {{the development of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm to prevent such occurrences. In this paper, we propose an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system for the efficient and safe operation of a manipulator by applying an intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm. Our proposed intelligent algorithm considers the direction of motion of the manipulator. In addition, using a new regression method, the algorithm includes a decision step that determines whether a detected object is a collision-causing obstacle or a part of the manipulator. We apply our <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system to a two-link manipulator and assess the performance of our intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm as compared with other models...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{controls}} are essential parts of industrial machinery {{because they are}} designed to stop the operation in case of emergencies without risks to operators, equipment, products, or facilities. Current guidelines for <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> controls have been formulated based on experience but not on empirical studies. The main objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} the type and orientation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons on the reaction time, mode of activation, and preferences of subjects in order to formulate guidelines for their selection. An experiment consisting of a simple, cooperative assembly operation with a Microbot was designed for this study. The main conclusions of this research are that reaction time to activate <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbutton is not affected by the orientation of the control but it is influenced by the type of control. The mode of activation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons is influenced by both the type and the orientation of the control. Subjects preferred <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards or with half guards over controls with full guards, and subjects also preferred an inclined orientation of the control over horizontal or vertical orientations. The following guidelines are recommended for the selection of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons. Select <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards. If a guard is absolutely required, select a guard with slots or a half guard to ensure adequate visibility of and access to the button. If possible, give <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons an inclined orientation (about 45 °) on the control panel. Avoid using vertical orientations for these controls...|$|R
2500|$|The incline grade changed {{three times}} from a steep 62% grade {{at the base}} to a gentler 48% grade at the top, but the cars were {{designed}} to comfortably adjust to the differences in grade. The incline was also equipped with a safety cable which ran through an emergency braking mechanism under each car and provided an <b>emergency</b> <b>stopping</b> of the cars within [...] should {{a failure of the}} main cable occur.|$|E
2500|$|Several TGV types {{have broken}} records, {{including}} the V150 and TGV 001. V150 was a specially modified five-car double-deck trainset that reached [...] under controlled conditions {{on a test}} run. It narrowly missed beating the world train speed record of [...] The record-breaking speed is impractical for commercial trains due to motor overcharging, empty train weight, rail and engine wear issues, elimination of all but three coaches, excessive vibration, noise and lack of <b>emergency</b> <b>stopping</b> methods.|$|E
2500|$|The sixth {{generation}} MY18 Polo {{is planned}} for a 2017 launch, with improvements in cabin space, engines, and interior technology. The car comes with the new 1.5 TSI [...] "EVO" [...] engine producing 148nbsp&hp, the new natural gas powered 1.0 TGI producing 89nbsp&hp and a 2.0 TSI for the new GTI model. Its boot space has increased by about 25 percent from 280 litres to 351 litres. Optionally, it now features the 2nd generation version of the Active Info Digital Display Cockpit which is a first in its class. As standard, the car comes with front collision detection, blindspot assist and <b>emergency</b> <b>stopping.</b> The car {{is said to be}} extremely customizable coming in 14 colours, and 17 dashboard colours. [...] The 2018 Polo was unveiled in Berlin on 16 June 2017. The general public can see the car in flesh at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, starting on 14 September.|$|E
50|$|Safety {{features}} include an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button which immediately moves the grinding wheel {{away from the}} ground rings on its revolutionary axis. Because of the wheel's momentum, it cannot be stopped but the power is cut and the wheel slows naturally, it cannot be reactivated until the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is reset. After the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is activated, {{the size of the}} workpiece must be re-established before the line can be reactivated into production mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A motion planner of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{must make}} an {{operating}} humanoid robot to a stationary state under the emergency signal. It {{plays an important}} role in prevention of falling over because humanoid robots fall over easily. Immedi-ately after the emergency signal, it must generate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion in real-time. We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) and COG (Center of Gravity) as its states. The <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> at any time. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by an experiment using humanoid robot HRP- 2. I...|$|R

2500|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. [...] PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. [...] Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". [...] Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. [...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. [...] Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for <b>emergency</b> <b>stopping</b> where all brakes were generally employed.|$|E

50|$|On railways, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{is a full}} {{application}} of the brakes {{in order to bring}} a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop,</b> or on some trains automatically, when the train has passed a red signal or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that he/she is still alert, which is known as a dead man's switch. A similar mechanism is the watchdog timer.|$|R
