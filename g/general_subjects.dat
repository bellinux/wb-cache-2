5|$|Jamia Hafsa was a {{madrassa}} {{for women}} located near Lal Masjid. It {{was the largest}} Islamic religious institution {{for women in the}} world, with more than 6,000 students. It was constructed by Maulana Qari Abdullah in 1992. After his assassination, supervision passed to his son Abdul Aziz. Students were taught <b>general</b> <b>subjects,</b> including mathematics and geography but were not tested on these subjects; the only exams were on religious subjects.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith's nephew Henry Frank Peterson came to {{work with}} her at the library, and began to {{organize}} the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified, one which used one- and two-digit numbers to stand for <b>general</b> <b>subjects,</b> and three-digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject. Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.|$|E
5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of <b>general</b> <b>subjects.</b> A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E

5|$|Before the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian (14586 BCE), {{there existed}} terse chronicles of {{events such as}} the Spring and Autumn Annals and the chronicle found at Shuihudi {{covering}} events in the State of Qin and Qin dynasty from 306 to 217 BCE. There was also the Classic of History—part of the Confucian canon—which recorded the deeds of past rulers and political events (sometimes mythological instead of historical). However, Sima's work is considered the first of China's Standard Histories, laid the groundwork for Chinese historiography by creating the first universal history of China. He divided his work of one hundred and thirty chapters into basic annals, chronological tables in grid format (with year-by-year accounts since 841 BCE, the start of the Gonghe Regency), treatises on <b>general</b> <b>subjects</b> (such as the economy and the calendar), histories of hereditary houses and states, biographies on individuals arranged in roughly chronological order, and his own autobiography as the last chapter. Being a court archivist allowed Sima to utilize eighty textual sources in addition to memorials, edicts, and stone inscriptions. These sources enhanced the enormous scope of his work, which mentions roughly four thousand people by name. He also traveled extensively to interview witnesses for more recent accounts.|$|E
25|$|Vocational schools {{also have}} courses. Usually, they teach 10-14 <b>general</b> <b>subjects</b> (English, math, biology, geography, history, etc.), a few {{professional}} subjects {{that are different}} for almost every course (hygiene in a nurse-technician course at medical schools, for example) and a compulsory block of practice classes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{the studies of}} law lasted three years and the {{curriculum}} included comparative and state (constitutional) law, international law, criminal law and judicial procedure, as well as <b>general</b> <b>subjects.</b> This is how the modern legal education in Serbia emerged in the year 1808. Before enrolling the legal department, it was compulsory to graduate at the philosophy department where the studies lasted two years, so the legal studies lasted {{a total of five}} years. Since 1853, the legal education became independent from the studies of philosophy and from 1863 the legal education in Serbia lasted four years.|$|E

25|$|The two {{line system}} was {{abolished}} in 2005 and the gymnasium was completely re-formed. More lines of study, decided by each gymnasium itself, were offered, {{and it was}} generally perceived to give a greater amount of customisability to the students. Instead of choosing a line of study when enrolling, the students now only let the school know what line they intend to choose, and the final decision is made after half a year of introduction to the different faculties (primarily the arts, languages and natural science). Furthermore, {{a wide range of}} <b>general</b> <b>subjects,</b> like for instance social studies, were made mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} license {{issued by}} the Dutch government {{was based on the}} input from Priesterraden, a special body set up in 1882 with the task of overseeing religious and Islamic education. On the advice of this body in 1905, the government passed a law requiring any instructor must first get permission to teach. At that time the government had already feared of possible resurgence among indigenous people. Soon after the permission was obtained, the Jamiat Kheir opened an elementary level (Ibtidaiyyah) madrasa in Pekojan which provided free education, using a curriculum blend of religious studies and <b>general</b> <b>subjects.</b> To show its anti-colonialism, non-religious subjects at the Jamiat Kheir were not taught in Dutch, but in English.|$|E

Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the Masoretic Text, Septuagint (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word).|$|E

2500|$|The opening {{chapter of}} the Institutes is perhaps the best known, in which Calvin {{presents}} the basic plan of the book. There are two <b>general</b> <b>subjects</b> to be examined: the creator and his creatures. Above all, the book concerns the knowledge of God the Creator, but [...] "as {{it is in the}} creation of man that the divine perfections are best displayed", there is also an examination of what can be known about humankind. After all, it is mankind's knowledge of God and of what He requires of his creatures that is the primary issue of concern for a book of theology. In the first chapter, these two issues are considered together to show what God has to do with mankind (and other creatures) and, especially, how knowing God is connected with human knowledge.|$|E
