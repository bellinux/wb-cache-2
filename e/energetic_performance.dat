5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the <b>energetic</b> <b>performance</b> of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to take a shot, forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E

25|$|On May 13, 2007, Diddley was {{admitted}} to intensive care in Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, following a stroke after a concert the previous day in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{investigations}} into nanostructured energetic materials have received worldwide concern and increasing research interest owing to their superior <b>energetic</b> <b>performances,</b> including low ignition temperature, rapid energy release, {{high energy density}} and tunable reactivity [1 – 10]. The chemical energy stored by these materials can be released upon electrical, optical, impact, or thermal actuation, {{which can be used}} for military purposes and civilian applications, such as initiation of secondary reactions [11], joining of materials [12], automotive air-bag propellants [13], and power supply [14]. Many methods including the physical mixing of nanopowders, arrested reactive milling of dense nanocomposites, electrophoretic nanoenergetic coating, and periodical deposition of nanolaminates have been introduced to fabricate nanostructured energetic materials [15 – 19]. Among these methods, the fabrication of nanolaminates through alternately depositing two or more different films provides a fascinating structure for device integration with tunable <b>energetic</b> <b>performances,</b> because the number of layers and the thickness of monolayer are easily controlled, and consequently to tune their <b>energetic</b> <b>performances.</b>|$|R
