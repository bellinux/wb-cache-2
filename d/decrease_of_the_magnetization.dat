40|$|Summary. A {{new method}} to {{determine}} the amount and moment distribution of fine magnetic grains in sediments is proposed. The method is applied to a dilute suspension made of the sediment. To apply this method, the magnetic grains must be in a non-interacting state. This condition can be confirmed by the magnetic relaxation pattern in a magnetic field-free space. The dilute suspension in a non-interacting state shows monotonic <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetization</b> with an exponential form, independent of whether the concentration changes. On the contrary, the concentrated suspension in an interacting state shows either little decrease of magnetization or else a 'polarity ' change after a quick decrease of magnetization. These two states are separated by the 'critical concentration', which is attributed to {{the characteristics of the}} source sediment. The fine magnetic grain assemblage of a non-interacting dilute suspension in a magnetic field attains an equilibrium magnetization state under the combined effects of the magnetic torque and thermal agitation (Brownian motion).

The effect of a transverse AC magnetic field on the permanent magnetization of the supercon- ductor are twofold: (i) the superconducting currents are redistributed in the supercon- ductor, and (ii) AC losses are generated, which may locally increase the temperature and degrade the superconducting properties. These two phenomena (current redistribution and losses) are differently affected by the frequency and the amplitude of the transverse magnetic field.

The intra- and interchain coupling are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, respectively, and the chain itself contains a 1 : 1 alternation of CoO 6 trigonal prisms (TP) and octahedra (oct.). The Co 3 + spin states are high spin (S= 2) and low spin (S = 0) in the TP and the oct., respectively. It is found that a few percent of Cr 3 + (S= 3 / 2) substituted for the low spin Cooct 3 + (S= 0) greatly affect the magnetic properties. Both coupling constants of the antiferromagnetic (interchain) and ferromagnetic (intrachain) interactions decrease as x increases up to x= 0. 10 in Ca 3 Co 2 -xCr xO 6. This is reflected by the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetization</b> saturation and of the magnetic field characteristic of the ferri- to ferromagnetic transition, below the Néel temperature.

In {{relation with the}} lower magnetic moment of Co atoms compared with that <b>of</b> Mn atoms, <b>the</b> Co to Mn substitution leads to a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximal <b>magnetization,</b> recorded at 5  K in an applied magnetic field of 9  T, from 54. 7  μB/f. u. for x =  0 to 36. 3  μB/f. u. for x =  0. 3. These materials present an anomalous magnetocaloric effect, characterized by two broad –ΔSM maxima of moderate magnitude at TC and around 100  K, yielding to wide magnetocaloric response from TC down to the lowest temperature, and consequently, a relatively large cooling capacity q 10 – 350 K (μ 0 ΔH =  5  T) reaching ∼  3. 7  J cm− 3 for Gd 6 (Mn 0. 875 Co 0. 125) 23.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{magnetic properties}} <b>of</b> composite Al 2 O 3 /Co(P) particles during ball milling and dynamic compaction is investigated. To prepare starting composite particles, the Al 2 O 3 granules were {{coated with a}} Co 95 P 5 shell by electroless plating. The magnetic and structural properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite particles are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Physical Property Measurement System. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> composite core-shell particles as starting powder for mechanoactivation allows to decrease treatment duration to 1 h and to produce a more homogeneous bulk sample than in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>of</b> Co and Al 2 O 3 powders. <b>The</b> magnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milled composite particles are correlated with changes in the microstructure. Reduction in grain size of Co during milling leads to an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volume fraction <b>of</b> superparamagnetic particles and to a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saturation <b>magnetization.</b> <b>The</b> local magnetic anisotropy field depends on <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> hcp-Co phase in sample.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} <b>the</b> partial {{substitution}} <b>of</b> Mn by Co in ErCoxMn 1 xO 3 manganites (0. 2 pxp 0. 7). Besides the structural changes {{due to a}} smaller tolerance factor, this perovskite system shows very interesting magnetic properties. Magnetic iso-field studies (ZFC–FC) reveal this system is ferrimagnetic, leading to a spin reversal at low temperature due to a negative exchange interaction between the two sublattices (rare-earth and transition metal ones). Furthermore, for samples near the ErCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3 composition, a very unusual behavior is observed when magnetization loops are performed at low temperature: a step-like transition occurs at about 4 T with increasing magnetic field, while the increasing and <b>decreasing</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetization</b> curves intersect in the low-field region. Neutron diffraction experiments were performed for the nominal composition (ErCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3) in order to study <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice parameters and magnetic structure at zero field in samples annealed under different atmospheres (air and oxygen). Results are discussed in relation to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> several magnetic entities and their respective exchange interactions. r 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|We {{report on}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> surface-sensitive {{techniques}} (x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism) to investigate interfacial effects in sputtered manganite thin films, La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 MnO 3 (LCMO) and La 2 / 3 Sr 1 / 3 MnO 3 (LSMO), with different capping layers [MgO, LaAlO 3 (LAO), SrTiO 3 (STO), NdGaO 3 (NGO), and Au]. To ensure surface sensitivity, data were acquired {{by using the}} total electron yield detection mode. It is found that LSMO and LCMO films exhibit similar behavior when capped with oxide layers but dissimilar effects when a metallic capping is used. Almost bulklike Mn valence at the interface was observed in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> LAO capping. However, a notorious increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mn oxidation state was detected for both MgO and NGO capping layers. In contrast, metallic Au and STO capping promotes a reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mn oxidation state. These results are correlated with the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism data, showing a concomitant <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saturation <b>magnetization</b> at <b>the</b> interface in those cases where a modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mn oxidation state is observed. © 2011 American Physical Society.

40|$|The Er(Co,Mn) O 3 solid solution, {{in which}} the Mn atom has been {{substituted}} by Co has shown very interesting magnetic features, for instance, a step-like transition at high fields with increasing magnetic field, while the increasing and <b>decreasing</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetization</b> loops intersect in the low field region. These perovskites {{can be described as}} ferrimagnetic, where the ferromagnetic Mn/ Co lattice is oriented in opposite direction to the Er moments. These phenomena are especially evident for ErCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3 where ferromagnetic interactions are maximized and, at the same time, a magnetization reversal is observed. In this work, we have prepared the Er 1 xYxCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3 (0. 0 pxp 1. 0) solid solution to sweep <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic moment at the rare-earth site. The more we replace Er by Y, the smaller becomes the average magnetic moment at the rare-earth site. All samples have orthorhombic structure (S. G. Pbnm) and the lattice parameter do not show significant variation when the Er is replaced by Y, so the remarkable differences seen on magnetic properties along the series are not related to changes in the structure. This systems goes from ferrimagnetic (with magnetization reversal) for x ¼ 0 (ErCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3) to normal ferromagnetic behavior for x ¼ 1 (YCo 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3). As the amount o yttrium increases, <b>the</b> remanent <b>magnetization</b> increases, <b>the</b> transition field decreases and the spin inversion gets weaker. Other important point to remark is that the magnetic transition has a dynamical component. r 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
