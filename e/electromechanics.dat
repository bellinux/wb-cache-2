25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} <b>electromechanics</b> and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E

To this end, the fundamental equations of the coupled field problem are introduced and the discretisation procedure for the numerical implementation is described. Furthermore, a three field formulation is proposed and implemented {{to treat the}} nearly incompressible behaviour of the elastomer. Because of the reduced electric permittivity of the material, very high electric fields are required for actuation purposes. To improve the <b>electromechanic</b> coupling a heterogeneous microstructure consisting of an elastomer matrix with barium titanate inclusions is proposed and studied...|$|R
