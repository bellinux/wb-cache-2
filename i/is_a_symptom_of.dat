5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan GÃ³mez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E

25|$|Dysphagia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> many {{different}} causes, which {{can usually be}} elicited through a careful history by the treating physician. A formal oropharyngeal dysphagia evaluation is performed by a medical speech pathologist or occupational therapist.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} blood {{visible in the}} stools, it {{is also known as}} dysentery. The blood is a trace of an {{invasion}} of bowel tissue. Dysentery <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of,</b> among others, Shigella, Entamoeba histolytica, and Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|A study {{designed}} specifically to survey for prevalence found that 49% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also had PBA. PBA {{does not appear to}} be associated with duration of ALS. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> ALS that many patients are unaware of and do not receive information about from their physician.|$|E

25|$|Allochiria {{is often}} {{confused}} with alloesthesia, {{also known as}} false allochiria. True allochiria <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> dyschiria and unilateral neglect. Dyschiria is a disorder in the localization of sensation due to various degrees of dissociation and cause impairment in one side causing the inability to tell {{which side of the}} body was touched.|$|E
25|$|Weakness or {{asthenia}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> {{a number}} of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{controversy}} has died {{down in the}} news, Chick-fil-A has resumed donations to some allegedly anti-LGBT organizations, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which rejects homosexual members, and Paul Anderson Youth Home, whose teachings include that homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> child abuse, according to 2015 tax returns. However, as of 2016, Chick-fil-A has not resumed donations to anti-LGBT lobbying groups.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{myoclonus}} {{occurs during}} the initial phases of sleep, especially {{at the moment of}} dropping off to sleep. Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep myoclonus are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> a more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. Myoclonus can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} this {{condition}} include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted {{from outside the}} tunnel), which include benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation. Carpal tunnel syndrome often <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and prior carpal tunnel syndrome surgery is very common in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that transthyretin amyloid deposition may cause carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
25|$|E. M. Forster {{is renowned}} {{as one of}} Scott's fiercest and unkindest critics. His {{critique}} has received fierce opposition from Scott scholars, who believe his attack <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> his ignorance, perhaps of literature, but more certainly of all things Scottish. This hostility reaches academic circles, as is made evident by Alan Massie's lecture The Appeal of Scott to the Practising Novel, the inaugural lecture at the 1991 Scott conference. Defence of Scott subsumes a defence of a national culture against the attacks of Englishness. Others have, however, suggested that this misrepresents Forster's case.|$|E

25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|The {{diarrhoea}} {{is caused}} by multiple activities of the virus. Malabsorption occurs because {{of the destruction of}} gut cells called enterocytes. The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces age- and calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, disrupts SGLT1 transporter-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and possibly activates the calcium ion-dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system. Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child's diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut.|$|E
25|$|A tremor is an involuntary, {{somewhat}} rhythmic, muscle contraction {{and relaxation}} involving to-and-fro movements {{of one or}} more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.|$|E

25|$|Kala-azar {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of Western doctors in 1824 in Jessore, India (now Bangladesh), where it was initially thought to be a form of malaria. Assam gave kala-azar one of its common names, Assam fever. Another common name, kala-azar (Hindustani: à¤à¤¾à¤²à¤¾ à¤à¤à¤¼à¤¾à¤° (Devanagari) Ú©Ø§ÙØ§ Ø¢Ø²Ø§Ø± (Nastaleeq) kÄlÄ ÄzÄr), is derived from kala which means black in Sanskrit, as well as in the languages descended from it, including Assamese, Hindi and Urdu; the word azar means Fever in Persian and Hindustani; as such the disease is named for the darkening of the skin on the extremities and abdomen that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the Indian form of the disease. The agent of the disease was also first isolated in India by Scottish doctor William Leishman (who observed the parasite in spleen smears of a soldier who died of the disease in Dumdum, Calcutta, India - hence the name dumdum fever) and Irish physician Charles Donovan, working independently of each other. As they published their discovery almost simultaneously, the species was named for both of themâLeishmania donovani.|$|E
25|$|Having {{left his}} {{equipment}} behind during the hasty retreat, the protagonist, now obviously hallucinating, uses the almost superhuman reflexes afforded {{to him by}} the final Mark to evade death at the hands of both the bandits and the Hisomu stalkers, and travels back to Japan with Ora, who recommends he kill Azai for the dishonor of failing to maintain the traditional Hisomu way. The protagonist uses his almost preternatural abilities to infiltrate past Hisomu-jo's new sophisticated defenses, and confronts Azai in his garden. When Ora arrives and commands the protagonist to slay Azai, Azai claims to be unable to see Ora, and, suggesting that she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the protagonist's creeping madness, insists that he satisfy his honor and kill himself before he slips too far beyond reason. Suddenly uncertain, the protagonist is reassured by Ora that Azai is lying to deceive him, and she urges him to murder Azai and purge the dishonorable Hisomu clan who followed him. Upon retrieving the ritual sword, the protagonist experiences a brief psychotic fugue state, in which he symbolically relives the events of his life subsequent to taking on the Mark. He finds himself in a courtyard opposite both Ora and Azai, who kneels and places his own sheathed sword on the ground, awaiting the protagonist's choice.|$|E
