5000|$|A typical press {{advertisement}} in April 1932 announced Hermann Pabst’s [...] "great epic of the mines" [...] Kameradschaft; Mädchen in Uniform, Mutter <b>Krausen,</b> Road to Life, and Alone by Trauberg and Kozintsev.|$|E
5000|$|Kotki [...] (German <b>Krausen)</b> is {{a village}} in the {{administrative}} district of Gmina Barciany, within Kętrzyn County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia.|$|E
5000|$|Kruzy [...] (German <b>Krausen)</b> is {{a village}} in the {{administrative}} district of Gmina Kolno, within Olsztyn County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately 6 km south-west of Kolno and 36 km north-east of the regional capital Olsztyn.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kräusening</b> is a {{conditioning}} {{method in}} which fermenting wort {{is added to}} the finished beer. The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively [...] "condition" [...] or level of carbonation. The <b>kräusening</b> method may also be used to condition bottled beer.|$|R
50|$|Following Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams {{continued}} to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and <b>krausening</b> (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.|$|R
5000|$|Genesee Cream Ale {{is a cold}} fermented, alcohlic {{beverage}} {{produced by}} the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester, NY. It is a light bodied ale. It was first introduced in late 1960. Genesee's brewmasters take an extra step of <b>kräusening,</b> {{a process in which}} finished beer is primed for carbonation with wort instead of sugar.|$|R
50|$|Beat were a Finnish band who {{represented}} their country in Eurovision Song Contest 1990. The group performed the song Fri? (Free?) in Swedish and finished 21st out of 22 countries, scoring 8 points. The group {{was composed of}} members Janne Engblom, Kim Engblom, Tina <b>Krausen</b> and Tina Petersson.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester Treinen {{was born}} in Donnelly, Minnesota, to William John and Kathryn (née <b>Krausen)</b> Treinen. He {{attended}} Crosier Seminary in Onamia from 1935 to 1941, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Paul Seminary in Saint Paul in 1943. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 11, 1946.|$|E
50|$|The {{editorial}} team works to publish writing by Western and Islamic authors who seek open and respectful discussion of both commonalities and controversial subjects. These have included diverse contributors, like the Egyptian literary scholar Nasr Hamid Abu Zaid, the German former diplomat and Muslim Murad Hofmann, the Islam theologian Halima <b>Krausen,</b> the conflict researcher Heiner Bielefeldt and the physicist Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker.|$|E
50|$|After {{moving to}} Berlin in 1928, Fethke {{worked as a}} writer and {{assistant}} for Ufa. His most successful films were Mutter <b>Krausens</b> Fahrt ins Glück ("Mommie Krause's trip into happiness") and Jenseits der Straße ("On {{the far side of the}} street"), for which he wrote the screenplay. At Ufa, he also made the acquaintance of Fritz Lang, who later used his Mr. Tot novel for his last film, The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960).|$|R
5000|$|Mother Krause's Journey to Happiness [...] (German: Mutter <b>Krausens</b> Fahrt ins Glück) is a 1929 German silent drama film {{directed}} by Phil Jutzi and starring Alexandra Schmitt, Holmes Zimmermann and Ilse Trautschold. The film {{was produced by}} the left-wing Prometheus Film, a German subsidiary of the Soviet company Mezhrabpom-Film. It depicts the cruelty of poverty and depicts Communism as a rescuing force that, alas, reaches Mutter Krause and the child that lives in Krause's apartment too late.|$|R
5000|$|... "Old Style" [...] {{was first}} brewed in 1902 by the G. Heileman Brewing Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin {{under the name}} Old Style Lager; it was popular in Wisconsin, the Chicago metro area, Minnesota, eastern Iowa, Lincoln, Nebraska, southwestern Michigan, Upper Michigan, and Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota. It has been served at Wrigley Field for many years, and is popular with fans of the Chicago Cubs. The {{original}} Heileman's Old Style brewery in La Crosse is now owned by the City Brewing Company. It brews La Crosse Lager, which {{is based upon the}} original Old Style recipe and is <b>kräusened</b> for 30 days. This beer may also be the basis for the brewery's nationally-distributed DB Hobbs brand.|$|R
50|$|Fermentation {{tanks are}} {{typically}} made of stainless steel. Simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends are arranged vertically, and conditioning tanks are usually laid out horizontally. A very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation but wood {{is difficult to}} keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched often, perhaps yearly. After high <b>kräusen,</b> {{the point at which}} fermentation is most active and copious foam is produced, a valve known in German as the spundapparat may be put on the tanks to allow the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer. This bung device can regulate the pressure to produce different types of beer; greater pressure produces a more carbonated beer.|$|E
5000|$|Kentucky Common Beer is a once-popular {{style of}} ale {{from the area}} in and around Louisville, Kentucky from the 1850s until Prohibition. This style is rarely brewed commercially today. It was also locally known as Dark Cream Common Beer, Cream Beer or Common Beer. [...] The beer was top-{{fermented}} and wasn't <b>krausened,</b> i.e., it was fermented once and sent out for sale which meant the gravity would be moderate, the carbonation low and the taste full and sweetish. Like cream ale, it was consumed fresh, usually as draught beer. In 1913 {{it was estimated that}} 80% of the beer consumed in Louisville was of this type. Many local breweries made this style of beer exclusively.|$|R
50|$|Budweiser is brewed using barley malt, rice, water, hops and yeast. It is lagered with {{beechwood}} {{chips in}} the aging vessel. While beechwood chips {{are used in}} the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in sodium bicarbonate soda for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, flocculation of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a <b>krausening</b> procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood chips {{at the bottom of the}} tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.|$|R
