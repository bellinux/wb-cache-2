2500|$|Commenters have however {{pointed out}} that Israel had already promised to release these same 104 Palestinians, back in 1999 under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, but never did. Critics also worry that Israel will simply quietly re-arrest the {{potentially}} released Palestinians, and state that Israel is using the slow release to hold the negotiations hostage and that the main goal of the release is to bolster Israel's image. According to the Sharm el-Sheikh <b>Fact-Finding</b> <b>Committee</b> Report, Israel's decision not to release the prisoners {{at the time was}} due to significantly increased violence against Israel by their partner in the memorandum, the PLO, leading up to the Second Intifada. In the time leading up to the planned release, Israel perceived [...] "institutionalized anti-Israel, anti-Jewish incitement; the release from detention of terrorists; the failure to control illegal weapons; and the actual conduct of violent operations" [...] as a sign that [...] "the PLO has explicitly violated its renunciation of terrorism and other acts of violence, thereby significantly eroding trust between the parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 December, {{thirteen}} Egyptian {{and international}} human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the mass killing of protesters in the capital on 14 August.

[...] "There can be no hope {{for the rule of}} law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history," [...] said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. [...] "As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent <b>fact-finding</b> <b>committee</b> to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings," [...] the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a [...] "small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law." [...] "After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record," [...] Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. [...] "Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters." [...] The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes.|$|E
