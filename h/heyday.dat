5|$|The halcyon {{days of the}} 1890s {{were the}} company's <b>heyday,</b> under {{president}} Richard Curzon Hoffman (the grandfather of noted author Walter Lord), when the prosperous line's gleaming steamships were heavily patronized by passengers enjoying the well-appointed staterooms and Chesapeake Bay culinary delights while dining {{to the accompaniment of}} live music. The nightly menu on board included oyster fritters, diamondback terrapin, duck, and turkey.|$|E
5|$|The town {{came into}} being as a spa in the Restoration and had its <b>heyday</b> as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring {{attracted}} visitors who wished to take the waters.

5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's <b>heyday</b> in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>heyday</b> of Reformation in the Commonwealth, {{at the end}} of the 16th century, {{there were}} about one {{thousand}} Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. Half a century later, only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and a printing facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of more trouble to come.|$|E

These present the domestic life from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and the 17th-century <b>heyday</b> until today, as well as works of the Chiprovtsi goldsmithing and carpet industry. The town has an Eastern Orthodox church dedicated to the Ascension of Jesus; {{the remains of the}} old Roman Catholic church of Saint Marty have also been preserved.

5|$|During the 1930s–1950s <b>heyday</b> {{of the big}} Hollywood studios, {{the status}} of women in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese <b>heyday</b> in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran {{along the length of}} the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Girdap's <b>heyday</b> {{was during}} the Balkan Wars and World War I (1912–1918), when it became the leading {{financial}} group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of invested capital, which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, the Balkan Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap was no exception to that trend.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by King Christian VII in 1776 {{and was one of}} the few {{companies}} with lasting significance from the age of mercantilism, played an important role in Norwegian trade with Denmark, the Netherlands and the Far East and had a decisive impact on the Norwegian economy in the period around 1814. In 1822 the company was sold to the Berlin banker Wilhelm Christian Benecke and Benjamin Wegner, and their ownership lasted until 1849, a period regarded as the company's <b>heydays</b> and during which it became the largest industrial company of the country. The company went bankrupt in 1849 in the wake of the revolutions of 1848 and competition from synthetic ultramarine, but a greatly reduced activity continued until 1898. From 1968 Blaafarveværket has been made available to the public as a museum and art gallery. It is presented to the public like the mining company it was around 1840 during its <b>heydays.</b>|$|R

This type of policy {{has not been}} in vogue since the <b>heydays</b> of Keynesian economics. Dismal experience with demand management policies during the 1970 s and 1980 s in combination with unemployment becoming persistent turned attention to structural issues, first wage formation and later search incentives.|$|R

Focus is on the Work Incentive (WIN) Program from its inception in 1968 to its <b>heydays</b> in the 1970 s and its decline during the Reagan era. The review provides a basis for examining the recent welfare legislation and recongizing the elements needed for real welfare reform...|$|R
5|$|Historic {{buildings}} from Basin's <b>heyday</b> form much of {{the core}} of the CDP's small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a low-power radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it relies on the government of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011 Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.|$|E

50|$|These {{plants were}} hit hard after this, however, with the {{internal}} strife of both the Bolshevik Revolution and the Russian Civil War, {{so much so that}} butter output dropped to a mere 6,000 tons in 1922, dipping below the 1894 levels. A revival came by 1927, however, when the 37,000-ton mark was reached and butter again became an important Russian export. However, the <b>heydays</b> of the Russian butter behemoth were over.|$|R
5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} {{religious and cultural}} centre, intended more as a display of his realm's <b>heyday</b> and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates, though at a reduced capacity compared to its <b>heyday,</b> and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction. Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in its <b>heyday</b> was {{the core}} of a very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmoured cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E

Cheti Mela, a fair held in April, is the major fair of the district. Other tourist attractions nearby include Dudhwa National Park, Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and Frog Temple.|$|R
50|$|Controversy also exists {{over the}} idea of {{representing}} the guilty. Mayer Goldman, back in the <b>heydays</b> of the public defender program, questioned what should happen if the public defender represents a guilty defendant. In fact, Harvard Law School's Guide for Careers in Indigent Defense, {{emphasizes the importance of}} having to get over the emotion and frustration of having to defend the guilty. Issues over the feeling of defending the guilty is something that people view differently.|$|R
