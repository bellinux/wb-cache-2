40|$|Objective: Elevated {{concentrations}} of hCG beta core fragment (hCG beta cf) {{are known to}} cause false-negative results in qualitative urine pregnancy test devices, but the pattern of urinary hCG beta cf during normal pregnancy has not been well characterized. Here, we evaluate the relationship between urine hCG, hCG beta cf, and hCG free beta subunit (hCG beta) during pregnancy. Design and methods: Banked second trimester urine specimens from 100 pregnant women were screened for high {{concentrations of}} hCG beta cf using a qualitative point-of-care device known to demonstrate false-negative results {{in the presence of}} elevated hCG beta cf concentrations. Additional first and third trimester specimens from the same pregnancy were obtained from 10 women who generated negative/faint positive results, 5 women who generated <b>intermediate</b> <b>positive</b> results, and 10 women who generated strong positive results on the point-of care device. Intact hCG, hCG beta cf, hCG beta, and specific gravity were quantified in these 75 specimens. Results: Urinary hCG beta cf concentrations were greater than intact hCG concentrations at all times. A strong correlation (r(2) = 0. 70) was observed between urine intact hCG and hCG beta cf concentrations. A poor correlation was observed between specific gravity and intact hCG (r(2) = 0. 32), hCG beta (r(2) = 0. 32), and hCG beta cf (r(2) = 0. 32). The highest hCG beta cf concentrations were observed between 10 and 16 weeks gestation but individual women demonstrated very different patterns of hCG beta cf excretion. Conclusions: Urine specimens with elevated hCG beta cf are frequently encountered during pregnancy but hCG beta cf excretion patterns are unpredictable. Manufacturers and clinicians must appreciate that hCG beta cf is the major immunoreactive component in urine during pregnancy and must design and interpret qualitative urine hCG test results accordingly.

40|$|Endometriosis is {{a complex}} {{disorder}} among women of reproductive age associated with chronic pelvic pain, debilitating dysmenorrhoea and infertility. These symptoms {{are thought to be}} the consequence of an inflammatory environment within the pelvis. Recently, a growing body of evidence indicates that abnormal inflammation is not only present in the pelvic endometriotic lesions but also in the eutopic endometrium of these patients leading to a proinflammatory environment unsuitable for implantation. Hence the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze by immunoblotting and by polymerase chain reaction the expression of inflammatory cytokines known to be involved in chronic endometritis (CE), in the eutopic endometrium of women affected by endometriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Endometrial samples were obtained from 12 patients 6 women affected by endometriosis and 6 controls. Histological and immunoistochemical study: An immunohistochemical investigation of tissue samples was performed utilizing antibodies anti-TNF, anti-IL- 1 , anti-IL- 6, anti-IL- 8, anti-IL- 10, anti-MCP- 1, and CD 138. Western blot (WB) : Approximately 50 mg of endometrium tissue collected were prepared for Western blot. The image was analysed by Uvitec, which detects the chemiluminescent blots of proteins staining (TNF, IL- 1 , IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, MCP- 1). PCR analysis: In 6 out of 12 patients PCR analysis was also performed in order to confirm immunoistochemical and WB analysis RESULTS Histological and immunohistochemical study and Western blotting The examination of endometrium specimens revealed the negative reaction for the antibodies anti-IL- 6 and IL- 10 in patients and controls; a strong positive reaction for the antibodies anti-IL- 1 β, IL- 8, MCP 1, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>positive</b> reaction for the antibodies anti- TNF and CD 138 in the endometriosic group. The control group revealed a negative reaction for all immunohistochemical dye. The immunohistochemical results were confirmed by Western blotting and real time PCR CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrated, in the eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis, an increased expression of cytokines known to be involved in subclinical chronic endometritis.

Dual expression of GFAP and vimentin was observed in the astroblastoma and astrocytes of Alexander's disease. The antigen availability for vimentin, however, was too low to allow reliable assessment of the GFAP:vimentin ratio in individual intermediate filaments and/or filament bundles. In meningioma, only vimentin <b>positive</b> <b>intermediate</b> filaments were found. GFAP <b>positive</b> <b>intermediate</b> filaments were present in all other specimens except the oligodendroglial components of the mixed glioma, which were devoid of intermediate filaments.

Technical and tissue processing factors {{had a significant effect}} on particle density values obtained for individual specimens. Although the number, distribution, and density of glial intermediate filaments varies in different astroglial entities, correlation of particle density values determined by immunoelectron microscopy with relative GFAP concentrations in different lesions requires utmost caution.
