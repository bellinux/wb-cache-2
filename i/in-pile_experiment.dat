40|$|The Fissile Material Disposition Program Light Water Reactor Mixed Oxide Fuel Irradiation Test Project Plan details {{a series}} of test irradiations {{designed}} to investigate the use of weapons-grade plutonium in MOX fuel for light water reactors (LWR) (Cowell 1996 a, Cowell 1997 a, Thoms 1997 a). Commercial MOX fuel has been successfully used in overseas reactors for many years; however, weapons-derived test fuel contains small amounts of gallium (about 2 parts per million). A concern exists that the gallium may migrate out of the fuel and into the clad, inducing embrittlement. For preliminary out-of-pile experiments, Wilson (1997) states that intermetallic compound formation is the principal interaction mechanism between zircaloy cladding and gallium. This interaction is very limited by the low mass of gallium, so problems are not expected with the zircaloy cladding, but an <b>in-pile</b> <b>experiment</b> is needed to confirm the out-of-pile experiments. Ryskamp (1998) {{provides an overview of}} this experiment and its documentation. The purpose of this Experiment Safety Assurance Package (ESAP) is to demonstrate the safe irradiation and handling of the mixed uranium and plutonium oxide (MOX) Fuel Average Power Test (APT) experiment as required by Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) Technical Safety Requirement (TSR) 3. 9. 1 (LMITCO 1998). This ESAP addresses the specific operation of the MOX Fuel APT experiment with respect to the operating envelope for irradiation established by the Upgraded Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company (LMITCO 1997 a).

40|$|The thermal-hydraulic {{and severe}} {{accidents}} analysis code RELAP 5 /SCDAPSIM {{was used in}} the calculation of the Phebus FPT 1 <b>in-pile</b> <b>experiment.</b> This experiment, carried out on 26 July 1996 in the Phebus facility, Cadarache, France, was chosen {{as the basis for the}} OECD International Standard Problem (ISP- 46) exercise. Investigation of severe accidents phenomena like fuel degradation and hydrogen production was the objective of the ISP and of the presented analysis. The ISP was an open exercise, that is, all the relevant experimental results were available to the participants from the start. The FPT 1 test bundle included 18 PWR fuel rods previously irradiated to a mean burn-up of 23. 4 GWd/tU, two instrumented fresh fuel rods and one silver-indium-cadmium control rod. The bundle was housed in an insulating shroud and introduced into the Phebus driver core which supplied the nuclear power. The fuel degradation phase of the test lasted about 5 hours during which the bundle was cooled by steam at pressure of about 2 bar with the mass flow rate varying between 0. 5 g/s and 2. 2 g/s, while the bundle nuclear power was being progressively increased from zero up to 36. 5 kW. RELAP 5 /SCDAPSIM modelling of the Phebus facility and the main results, such as the temperature response of all rods and shroud, the oxidation and resulting hydrogen production, will be discussed and presented in this paper. The analysis of fuel rods degradation and problems related to SCDAPSIM underprediction of the amount of relocated fuel and cladding will also be covered. ...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a carbon dioxide gas cooled beryllia moderated pebble bed reactor system has been undertaken to assess its technical feasibility and economic potential from the engineering point of view. This report describes the design and shows how subsequent analysis indicated the likely costs of such a system and possible technical improvements. It was found that data vital to a detailed design would not be available for some years and {{it was decided to}} proceed initially with a reference design based on optimistic predictions of these data. This was expected to indicate the materials and physics requirements necessary to achieve an attractive working design. The two most important predictions from the initial work on neutron physics and materials properties were that a maximum value of 1 75 for the burnup (in terms of fissions per initial fissile atom (FI. F. A,)) could be obtained with plutonium fuel from natural uranium reactors in which the fuel had been burned to 3000 MWd/tonne, and that fuel elements of. 1 — 3 / 8 inch diameter should survive sufficiently intact in a core in which the coolant flow was upwards at an average core power density of llW/cmJ without an embarrassing fission product release due to an excessive number of failed fuel elements. For this reference design a moderator—fuel ratio of 1650 was chosen. It was assumed that the fuel, cycle for this design was open, that is, spent fuel was discarded. A 200 MWe unit upflow design is presented and the economics of such a system described and extrapolated to cover a range of sizes. Further work using the reference design as a basis was done to investigate a closed fuel cycle and the effect of varying the major design parameters Later nuclear analysis indicated that the burnup would be limited to a value for F. I. F. A, of about 14 for open cycle working. Economic analysis indicated that the best method of operating such a design in a 5000 MWe system would be as a one-pass core at a burnup (F [...] I. F. A,) of 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 with U 233 recycle. Since the economics of the cycle tended to remain fairly constant over a wide range of moderator ratio a larger moderator ratio (2000 - 2500) could be chosen for the recycle system-Calculations indicated that a desirable negative temperature coefficient and a satisfactory control and shutdown system should be achievable. However, to verify this a deep reactor physics investigation would be necessary- including hot critical assembly tests. The analysis of the fuel element thermal stress behaviour was also not conclusive because the material behaviour depends largely on fabrication techniques which are not fully established. There seems a good possibility that the requirements will be met but difficulties with reprocessing are expected and further investigations into thermal stress and fission product retentivity by means of a test bed or <b>in—pile</b> <b>experiment</b> would be essential to establish technical feasibility-Comparison with the 2 x 500 MWe CANDU system shows that even with the presently most optimistic assumptions the reference design upflow P-BR system is economically inferior. It is suggested that further investigation of superposed irradiation damage, contact stresses wear, and adhesion could lead to a feasible downflow design. When combined with investigations of approach to equilibrium, chemical reprocessing, and topping cycles this might lead to significant improvements in unit costs but at this stage it seems unlikely that a system could be devised which would be sufficiently attractive to justify its development as a large power statio...|$|E

40|$|Presently {{there is}} a clear trend of {{increasing}} demands on in-pile performance of nuclear fuel. Higher target burnups, part length rods and various fuel additives are some examples of this trend. Together with an increasing demand from the public for even safer nuclear power utilisation, this implies an increased focus on various experimental, preferably non-destructive, methods to characterise the fuel. This thesis focuses on the development and experimental evaluation of such methods. In its first part, the thesis presents a method based on gamma-ray spectroscopy with germanium detectors that have been used at various power reactors in Europe. The aim with these measurements is to provide information about the thermal power distribution within fuel assemblies in order to validate core physics production codes. The early closure of the Barsebäck 1 BWR offered a unique opportunity to perform such validations before complete depletion of burnable absorbers in Gd-rods had taken place. To facilitate the measurements, a completely submersible measuring system, LOKET, was developed allowing for convenient in-pool measurements to be performed. In its second part, the thesis describes methods that utilise in-pile measurements. These methods have been used in the Halden test-reactor for determination of fission gas release, pellet-cladding interaction studies and fuel development studies. Apart from the power measurements, the LOKET device has been used for fission gas release (FGR) measurements on single fuel rods. The significant reduction in fission gas release in the modern fuel designs, in comparison with older designs, has been demonstrated in a series of experiments. A FGR database covering a wide range of burnup, power histories and fuel designs has been compiled and used for fuel performance analysis. The fission gas release has been measured on fuel rods with average burnups well above 60 MWd/kgU. The comparison between core physics calculations (PHOENIX- 4 /POLCA- 7) and the in-pool measurements of thermal power indicates that the nodal power can generally be predicted with an accuracy within 4 % and the bundle power with an accuracy better than 2 %, expressed as rms errors. <b>In-pile</b> <b>experiments</b> have successfully simulated the conditions that occur in a fuel rod following a primary debris failure, being secondary fuel degradation. It was concluded that massive hydrogen pick-up takes place during the first few days following the primary failure and that a pre-oxidized layer does not function as a barrier towards hydriding in an environment with a very high partial pressure of hydrogen.

40|$|Fuel {{to be used}} in an Accelerator Driven System (ADS) for {{transmutation}} in a fast spectrum can {{be described}} as a highly innovative concept in comparison with fuels used in critical cores. ADS fuel is not fertile, so as to improve the transmutation performance. It contains plutonium and a high concentration of minor actinides (~ 50 %). This unusual fuel composition results in high gamma and neutron emissions during its fabrication, as well as degraded performance of the core. So, an optimal ADS fuel is based on finding the best compromise between thermal, mechanical, chemical, neutronic and technological constraints.

The SLF is tasked with three functions, namely temperature control by gas mixture technique, surveillance of safety parameters (temperature, pressure, radioactivity etc.) and analysis of fission gas release for three individual capsules in two separate experimental rigs. The SLF enables continuous and independent surveillance of all gas circuits. The release of volatile fission products (FP) from the <b>in-pile</b> <b>experiments</b> is monitored by continuous gas purging. The fractional release of these FP, defined as the ratio between release rate of a gaseous fission isotope (measured) to its instantaneous birth rate (calculated), is a licensing-relevant test for HTR fuel.

40|$|The tritium {{breeding}} blanket is one of {{the most}} important components of a fusion reactor because it directly involves both energy extraction and tritium production, both of which are critical to fusion power. Because of their overall desirable properties, lithium-containing ceramic solids are recognized as attractive tritium breeding materials for fusion reactor blankets.

In numerous <b>in-pile</b> <b>experiments,</b> these materials have performed well, showing good thermal stability and good tritium release characteristics. Tritium release is particularly facile when an argon or helium purge gas containing hydrogen, typically at levels of about 0. 1 %, is used.

In particular, a large amount of hydrogen in the purge gas will necessitate a large multiple-stage tritium purification unit, which could translate into higher costs.

40|$|One {{major item}} in the {{assessment}} of the feasibility of Minor Actinide transmutation in ADS systems deals with the fuel, that can be described as highly innovative in comparison with fuels used in a critical core. Indeed, the fuel composition, with high concentrations (up to 50 %) of Minor Actinides and plutonium, results in significant production of helium during irradiation as well as high gamma, neutron emissions and heat in fabrication and handling stages. Studies on fuel development within the European project EUROTRANS, motivated by assessing the industrial practicability for actinides transmutation, have provided a wide range of results. CERamic-CERamic and CERamic-METallic composite fuels consisting of particles of (Pu,MA) O 2 dispersed in a magnesia or molybdenum matrix were investigated as primary candidates. Fuel performance and safety of preliminary core designs for a prospective 400 MWth transmuter: the European Facility for Industrial Transmutation, were evaluated to support the project.

Melt Progression (MP) experiments were designed to provide information to develop and verify computer models for analysis of LWR core damage in severe accidents. Experiments examine the formation and motion of ceramic molten pools in disrupted reactor core regions. The MP- 2 experiment assembly consisted of: (1) a rubble bed of enriched UO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } simulating severely disrupted reactor core regions, (2) a ceramic/metallic crust representing blockage formed by early phase melting, relocation, and refreezing of core components, and (3) an intact rod stub region that remained in place below the blockage region. The test assembly was fission heated in the central cavity of the ACRR at an average rate of about 0. 2 KA, reaching a peak molten pool temperature around 3400 K. Melting of the debris bed ceramic components was initiated {{near the center of}} the bed. The molten material relocated downward, refreezing to form a ceramic crust near the bottom of the rubble bed. As power levels were increased, the crust gradually remelted and reformed at progressively lower positions in the bed until late in the experiment when it penetrated into and attacked the ceramic/metallic blockage. The metallic components of the blockage region melted and relocated to the bottom of the intact rod stub region before the ceramic melt penetrated the blockage region from above. The ceramic pool penetrated halfway into the blockage region by the end of the experiment.

40|$|Abstract. Reliable {{criteria}} of secondary hydriding failures {{are important to}} assure safe operation of nuclear fuel in LWR power units. The present paper reviews available data on massive hydriding of zirconium claddings covering out-of-pile studies and in-pile tests in research reactors. Analyses of these experimental data give evidence that threshold conditions leading to the onset of massive hydriding are drastically changed under irradiation. The changes are caused mainly by irradiation damage of oxygen sublattice in ZrO 2 by fission fragments leaving the periphery of fuel pellets. The tests in research reactors provide a basis to develop a parametric dependency which relates the threshold of massive hydriding to composition of steam-hydrogen mixture, irradiation dose rate and temperature.

40|$|The LIMBO (liquid metal boiling) {{code for}} the {{analysis}} of two-phase flow phenomena in an LMFBR reactor coolant channel is presented. The code uses a non-equilibrium, annular, two-phase flow model, which allows for slip between the phases. Furthermore, the model is intended to be valid for both quasi-steady boiling and rapid coolant voiding of the channel. The code was developed primarily for the prediction of, and the posttest analysis of, coolant-voiding behavior in the SLSF P-series <b>in-pile</b> safety test <b>experiments.</b> The program was conceived to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. It is particularly suited for parametric studies requiring many computer runs and for the evaluation of the effects of model or correlation changes that require modification of the computer program. The LIMBO code, of course, lacks the sophistication and model detail of the reactor safety codes, such as SAS, and is therefore intended to compliment these safety codes...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, the Phébus FP {{programme}} of integral experiments was {{considered as a}} necessary complement to the qualification “one by one” of physical models through analytical experiments, which has the disadvantage of introducing hypotheses e. g. on the additivity of phenomena and do not allow {{to be sure that}} no important phenomenon has been omitted. Also the physico-chemical nature of a number of species can best be determined in integral type of experiments. For all those purposes, a series of five <b>in-pile</b> integral <b>experiments</b> has been performed. The facility provided prototypic reactor conditions which allowed the study of basic phenomena governing core degradation through to the late phase (melt pool formation), hydrogen production, fission product (FP) release and transport, circuit and containment phenomena, and iodine chemistry. For each of these topics, key lessons have been learnt and are described. Amongst the most important, one can cite: 	The need to revisit cladding oxidation modelling, that impacts the hydrogen production kinetics, 	The fuel collapse (transition from rod-like geometry towards a molten pool) at temperatures far below what was expected, 	The fission product release from degrading fuel, 	The chemical form of fission products when transported in the Reactor Coolant System, especially for iodine and caesium, most important radionuclides, 	The in-containment behaviour of iodine especially the reactions between iodine and paints and the trapping of iodine by silver under certain conditions. From these findings, the physical models implemented in simulation tools used for safety studies have been improved. However integral experiments such as Phébus FP have often the disadvantage not to allow an accurate enough determination of the values of the parameters of physical models. IRSN and partners therefore decided to launch new separate-effect experiments in order to address remaining uncertainties. JRC. F. 5 -Nuclear Reactor Safety Assessmen...|$|R
40|$|MISTRAL is a {{theoretical}} model developed to describe tritimn transport and release in fine-grained ceramic materials for tritium breeding a~piications in fusion blankets. The model includes as relevant physical processes tritium diffusion in the effective bulk (grams and gram boundary), adsorption, r~ombina~on and desorption at the breeder surface and diffusion thong {{the network of}} pores. A key improvement of the model, compared with those already in the literature, consists of a better characterization of the processes at the breeder surface and their linking to the bulk and pore regions. The sets of governing transport equations and corresponding boundary conditions are formulated together with {{the choice of the}} computational algorithm. A computer code with transient capabilities has been developed based on the model. It aims at describing tritium release for several transient conditions relevant for <b>in-pile</b> tritium recovery <b>experiments</b> and for fusion blankets. To assess the range of app~~bility of the model, several calculations have been performed and the results of the analysis are herein presented and discussed. The processes by which tritium migrates through lit~um-base ceramics {e. g. Li,O, L&O,, Li,SiO,, LiaZrO,) are complex and of considerable interest for solid breeder blanket components for fusion applica-tions. They determine the rate at which tritium will b...|$|R
40|$|During the {{operation}} of ITER, the plasma facing components will undergo different kinds of thermal loadings like thermal fatigue, vertical displacement events and disruptions. In addition degradation effects due to neutron irradiations may play an important role. The electron beam facilities JUDITH and OHBIS {{have been designed to}} carry out ITER relevant simulation experiments on neutron irradiated materials and components. Carbon fiber reinforced carbon materials (CFC), Be and W alloys have been tested in thermal shock experiments. Thermal fatigue experiments have been performed with joints of these materials to Cu alloys. In thermal fatigue experiments no influence {{on the quality of the}} joints was observed whatever the testing facilities or materials combinations. But for CFC mock-LIPS the surface temperature is significantly increased due to the reduction in thermal conductivity. During experiments at high power densities annealing effects could be observed. Thermal shock tests show a higher erosion after neutron irradiation. The tests described above are not able to simulate the superposition of nuclear and thermal loads. In order to study the synergistic effects, <b>in-pile</b> thermal fatigue <b>experiments</b> with two CFC/Cu mock-ups and a Be-Cu mock-up have been performed in the SM- 2 fission reactor in Dimitrovgrad (Russia). A first evaluation showed good performance of all three mock-ups. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The International Phebus Fission Product programme, {{initiated}} in 1988 and {{performed by the}} French Institut de adioprotection et de Suret´e Nucl´eaire (IRSN), investigates {{through a series of}} <b>in-pile</b> integral <b>experiments,</b> key phenomena involved in light water reactor (LWR) severe accidents. The tests cover fuel rod degradation and the behaviour of fission products released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results of the first two tests, called FPT 0 and FPT 1, carried out under low pressure, in a steam rich atmosphere and using fresh fuel for FPT 0 and fuel burned in a reactor at 23 GWdt− 1 for FPT 1, were immensely challenging, especially with regard to the iodine radiochemistry. Some of the most important observed phenomena with regard to the chemistry of iodine were indeed neither predicted nor pre-calculated, which clearly shows the interest and the need for carrying out integral experiments to study the complex phenomena governing fission product behaviour in a PWR in accident conditions. The three most unexpected results in the iodine behaviour related to early detection during fuel degradation of a weak but significant fraction of volatile iodine in the containment, the key role played by silver rapidly binding iodine to form insoluble AgI in the containment sump and the importance of painted surfaces in the containment atmosphere for the formation of a large quantity of volatile organic iodides. To support the Phebus test interpretation small-scale analytical experiments and computer code analyses were carried out. The former, helping towards a better understanding of overall iodine behaviour, were used to develop or improve models while the latter mainly aimed at identifying relevant key phenomena and at modelling weaknesses. Specific efforts were devoted to exploring the potential origins of the early-detected volatile iodine in the containment building. If a clear explanation has not yet been found, the non-equilibrium chemical processes favoured in the primary coolant circuit and the early radiolytic oxidation of iodides in the condensed water films are at present the most likely explanations. Models that were modified or developed and embodied in the computer codes for organic iodide formation/destruction in the gas phase and Ag–I reactions in the sump lead, in agreement with the Phebus findings respectively to greatly enhanced organic iodide formation kinetics and long term concentration in the containment atmosphere on one hand and, in the conditions of Phebus experiments, to significantly limited molecular iodine volatilisation from the sump in so far as silver was in excess compared to iodine, on the other hand. Organic iodides then quickly gain in importance and become the predominant volatile iodine species at long term. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R
40|$|FPT 3 was {{the last}} of the five <b>in-pile</b> {{integral}} <b>experiments</b> in the Phébus FP programme, whose overall purpose was to investigate fuel rod degradation and behaviour of Fission Products (FPs) released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results contribute to validation of models and computer codes used to calculate the source term for a severe accident with core meltdown in light water reactors. Unlike the previous tests, FPT 3 used B 4 C as absorber material in the pre-irradiated (24. 5 GWd/tU) fuel bundle, while featuring a steam-poor period as in FPT 2, that used Ag/In/Cd absorber. The main FPT 3 containment results are summarised: the source term of FPs, fuel and structural materials from the experimental circuit into the containment; the composition, morphology and deposition processes of aerosols in the containment atmosphere; the specific behaviour of the radiologically-significant FP iodine; and finally the performance of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs) exposed to the containment atmosphere just after the transient. The major elements contributing to the aerosol mass in the containment are the volatile FPs Cs and Mo, the control rod material B, the cladding material Sn, and the instrumentation materials Re and W (specific to Phébus tests). The fractional compositions, leaving aside the control rod materials, were very similar in FPT 2 and FPT 3. After reactor shutdown, homogenisation of the aerosol size in the containment led to only one aerosol population, similar to the previous tests. Long-term aerosol deposition in the containment is dominated by gravitational settling and diffusiophoresis, but also significant deposits were measured on the vertical wall, consisting of multi-component aerosols, again comparable with FPT 2. A significant result of FPT 3 is that iodine is mainly in gaseous form in the atmosphere up to containment isolation; the rest in aerosol form. Another important result is the fast decrease of the iodine concentration in the atmosphere, for total iodine (gas and aerosol), mainly due to deposition on the painted condensers; the depletion of the airborne aerosols Cs and Te was about a factor of 3 slower. As in FPT 2, gaseous iodine is mainly in molecular form. Iodine collected in the sump is essentially in soluble form throughout, probably due to the replacement of Ag/In/Cd by B 4 C as the absorber material. Concerning the PARs, which were introduced in the vessel when the overall aerosol, FP and hydrogen releases in the containment atmosphere had ended, analysis of their surface temperature evolution indicated that, despite the very low oxygen concentration in the FPT 3 containment, they worked quite well and were not poisoned by FPs during their 30 minute exposure time.
