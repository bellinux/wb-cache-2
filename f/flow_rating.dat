40|$|Abstract—Although many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} flow hydraulics in compound channels, {{there are still many}} complicated problems in determination of their <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves. Many different methods have been presented for these channels but extending them for all types of compound channels with different geometrical and hydraulic conditions is certainly difficult. In this study, by aid of nearly 400 laboratory and field data sets of geometry and <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves from 30 different straight compound sections and using artificial neural networks (ANNs), flow discharge in compound channels was estimated. 13 dimensionless input variables including relative depth, relative roughness, relative width, aspect ratio, bed slope, main channel side slopes, flood plains side slopes and berm inclination and one output variable (flow discharge), have been used in ANNs. Comparison of ANNs model and traditional method (divided channel method-DCM) shows high accuracy of ANNs model results. The results of Sensitivity analysis showed that the relative depth with 47. 6 percent contribution, is the most effective input parameter for flow discharge prediction. Relative width and relative roughness have 19. 3 and 12. 2 percent of importance, respectively. On the other hand, shape parameter, main channel and flood plains side slopes with 2. 1, 3. 8 and 3. 8 percent of contribution, have the least importance.

40|$|In {{practice}} discharges of untreated wastewater occur {{from many}} wastewater sewer systems, often via Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO). The untreated wastewater from SSO {{can be transferred}} through the overflow systems into receiving waters, reducing their quality and bringing risks to human health and aquatic organisms. Increased awareness of {{the negative effects of}} SSOs has {{led to the development of}} various control measures as part of watershed protection programs around the world. However, the information the number of SSO events is often unknown due to poor or limited monitoring. A further problem is that backflows can occur through an overflow system, with receiving waters entering the wastewater network due to elevated levels of the receiving waters. This additional relatively clean water often increases the volumes of water that need to be transported to the treatment facility and dilutes wastewater pollutants, resulting in lower treatment efficiency and higher costs for chemicals, increasing electricity consumption for any intermediate booster pumps and within the treatment plant. This paper illustrates how the flap gates, commonly used for preventing these backflows, also can be used for the estimation of SSO discharge volumes. An experimental full-scale setup was designed where sewage flowed through a flap gate between two chambers with a constant flow rate. The stabilised water heads in the two chambers and the flow rate were measured. Experiments were performed for both dry and submerged flap gate conditions (the latter is relevant for the SSO event occurring during high water level in the receiving waters). In total, five flap gates with opening dimensions of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm were tested and <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves were established with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). Results of the opening pressure tests showed some deviations between the values specified by the manufacturer of the flap gates and the experimentally obtained opening pressure values. An approach to generalising the <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves for other than tested diameters of the flap gates is suggested. The usage of <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves for estimation of the volume is discussed. This study showed that the water head measurements before and after the flap gate can provide a reliable and inexpensive method for quantification of the SSO discharge volumes.

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} calculating stage-discharge {{relations}} (rating curves) and suspended sediment concentrations in gravel bedded streams is presented {{and applied to}} a reach downstream from a U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station on Little Prickly Pear Creek, MT. The approach uses a fluid-mechanically based model to convert measurements of stage into discharge and boundary shear stress fields appropriate for determining sediment transport. The model does not use empirical roughness coefficients, such as the Manning coefficient, but rather determines channel roughness from field measurements of the channel geometry and the dominant physical and biological roughness elements in the modeled reach. The theoretical <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curve produced by the model is in excellent agreement with direct measurements of discharge made by the USGS. An empirical relation between the concentration of fine sediment near the bed {{and the rate of}} bedload transport is developed using station sediment data. This relation and a point measurement of concentration as a function of grain size are employed by the model to calculate suspended sediment concentration fields and fluxes in the reach. The approach also can be used to generate a sediment rating curve. Our method has the potential of providing accurate estimates of stream flow and suspended sediment loads less expensively than conventional gaging methods...|$|E

In this study we investigate the feasibility to constrain a fluid mechanics-based flow model for defining stream <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves with remotely sensed topographic data from airborne LiDAR scanning. A near infrared (NIR) LiDAR scan was carried out for an 8 -m wide channel in northern Sweden. The topographic information from this NIR LiDAR scan along the 90 -m surveyed reach was used to define channel geometry above the water surface. To fill in the channel bed topography below the water surface we used a detailed ground survey to create a hybrid model for comparison to a simple assumption of a flat bottom channel. Based on the boundaries of confidence intervals calculated from the direct measurements, we show that for the channel considered the sim- ple flat bottom assumption performs just as well as the hybrid model with regards to estimating direct discharge measurements. The mismatch between the two models was greatest at low flows and may be associated with unre- solved submerged bed topography. This deficiency, while rather small, could potentially be remedied by scanning during periods of low flow, or use other techniques such as multi-frequency bathymetric LiDAR or passive optical remote sensing that offer alternative ways for generating the necessary topographic information...|$|E

40|$|Separate {{sewerage}} {{systems are}} {{designed so that}} the wastewater and stormwater are carried separately. However, in practice, untreated wastewater discharges to receiving waters are not that rare, impairing {{the quality of the}} receiving waters and increasing the risks to public health and aquatic organisms. The two main causes for such discharges are wastewater that enters stormwater sewers as well as sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from the separate wastewater sewers. The overall aim of this licentiate thesis is to review and improve the strategies used for detection of wastewater inputs to stormwater sewers and their location, and {{to address the issue of}} quantification of untreated wastewater discharges into the receiving waters by developing two methods: one for SSO discharges and one for the estimation of the wastewater amounts in stormwater sewers. A review of methods for detecting the entry of wastewater into stormwater sewers and the location of the entry points has been carried out by a critical literature review of the effectiveness of the current methods, their advantages, weaknesses and limitations in use. Additionally, an evaluation of the factors affecting the performance of a selected number of methods has been made from specially designed field studies, focusing on detectability of certain indicative pollution parameters and the effects of travel distance. The parameters selected based on those identified as being potentially the most useful in the literature review were E. coli, total coliform, Enterococci, conductivity, turbidity, TSS, and ammonium. The estimation of the volumes of untreated wastewater discharged into receiving waters was addressed by developing two methods: (1) volume estimation of SSO discharges based on already available infrastructure—backflow preventing flap gates—by performing full-scale studies to establish <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves as a function of water head; and (2) estimation of wastewater ingress volumes into a stormwater system by using data from field studies as input to a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability distribution of possible fractions of wastewater in stormwater sewers. The reviewed indicator parameters and methods all demonstrated potential for detecting stormwater contamination by wastewater. However, there was no single method or strategy that would work under all conditions investigated. Human waste specific indicators—microbiological (adopted in microbial source tracking methods) and chemical markers (e. g., caffeine and carbamazepine) —as well as the Distributed Temperature Sensing method provided the best indication of wastewater pollution in the literature. However, these methods are currently beyond the capabilities of typical municipal expertise due to their costs and/or complexity and, therefore, combinations of methods that minimise the limitations of individual approaches have been identified in this thesis as the most effective provided these are tailored to specific cases. The travel distance from the point at which the wastewater entered the stormwater sewer is an important factor affecting the detectability of the investigated parameters, as the concentrations of the indicator parameters may change along the sewer length due to dilution, dispersion, physical, chemical, and microbiological processes. A Maximum Detection Distance (MDD) away from the origin of the input was determined which was in general shorter for the microbiological parameters than for the physicochemical parameters. Among the microorganisms analysed, Enterococci showed the shortest MDD of about 330 – 550 m, and E. coli — the longest of about 635 – 1245 m. Of the physicochemical parameters, the shortest MDD was for TSS (800 – 1130 m) and the longest for conductivity (1220 – 1560 m). MDD itself is not the main factor for selecting what parameters should be used, but rather how the sampling strategy for a particular parameter should be planned. The full-scale experiments on circular flap gates provided flow-rating curves for diameters of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). There are a large number of such gates installed in Sweden and the <b>flow</b> <b>rating</b> curves developed in this study could help practitioners to monitor SSO discharges with minimal onsite measurements (water head before and after the flap gate) in a reliable and inexpensive way. From the field study results, an equation was developed to estimate the volume of wastewater entering into the stormwater sewer. Monte Carlo simulation was selected as a means to increase the robustness of the outcome of the developed equation. The results of the simulation showed that the efficiency of the suggested method varied to a great extent depending on the selected combination of parameters: for example, for TSS and conductivity the percent error between the most probable and actual wastewater fractions in the sewer was less than 2 %, while TSS combined with microbiological parameters failed as a combination to estimate the wastewater fraction in sewer.
