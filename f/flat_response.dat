5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a <b>flat</b> <b>response</b> over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. <b>flat</b> <b>response)</b> is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a <b>flat</b> <b>response.</b> Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Clinical adrenal {{insufficiency}} {{has been reported}} with doses of inhaled fluticasone proprionate (FP) > 400 μg/day, the maximum dose licensed for use in children with asthma. Following two cases of serious {{adrenal insufficiency}} (one fatal) attributed to FP, adrenal function was evaluated in children receiving FP outwith me licensed dose. Methods: Children recorded as prescribed FP ≥ 500 μg/day were invited to attend for assessment. Adrenal function was measured using the low dose Synacthen test (500 ng/ 1. 73 m 2 intravenously) and was categorised as: biochemically normal (peak cortisol response > 500 nmol/l); impaired (peak cortisol < 500 nmol/l); or flat (peak cortisol < 500 nmol/l with increment of < 200 nmol/l and basal morning cortisol < 200 nmol/l). Results: A total of 422 children had been receiving FP alone or in combination with salmeterol; 202 were not investigated (137 FP within license; 24 FP discontinued); 220 attended and 217 (age 2. 6 - 19. 3 years) were successfully tested. Of 194 receiving FP 2 = 500 μg/day, six had <b>flat</b> <b>responses,</b> 82 impaired responses, 104 were normal, and in 2 the LDST was unsuccessful. Apart from the index child, the other five with <b>flat</b> <b>responses</b> were asymptomatic; a further child with impairment (peak cortisol 296 nmol/l) had encephalopathic symptoms with borderline hypoglycaemia during an intercurrent illness. The six with <b>flat</b> <b>responses</b> and the symptomatic child were all receiving FP doses of ≥ 1000 μg/day. Conclusion: Overall, <b>flat</b> adrenal <b>responses</b> in association with FP occurred in 2. 8 % of children tested, all receiving ≥ 1000 μg/day, while impaired responses were seen in 39. 6 %. Children on above licence FP doses should have adrenal function monitoring {{as well as a}} written plan for emergency steroid replacement...|$|R
25|$|The IF stage {{includes}} a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits {{in order to}} achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a <b>flat</b> <b>response</b> across the desired signal spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.|$|E
25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for <b>flat</b> <b>response</b> after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E
500|$|Zobel invented several filters whose {{defining}} characteristic was {{a constant}} resistance as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band.

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{changes in}} response to the Valsalva maneuver (VM) reflect the integrity of the baroreflex that regulates BP. Performing this maneuver in the standard supine position often prevents adequate venous preload reduction, resulting in a rise rather than a fall in BP, the “flat top ” Valsalva response. We determined whether performing the Valsalva Maneuver (VM) at a 20 degree angle of head up tilt (20 _deg) improves preload reduction, thereby reducing the frequency of <b>flat</b> top <b>responses,</b> improving reflex vasoconstriction, and increasing the Valsalva ratio (VR). 130 patients were evaluated in a prospective study.
