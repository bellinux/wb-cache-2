25|$|The {{number of}} {{multiple}} births has {{increased over the}} last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably {{be attributed to the}} impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by <b>intrauterine</b> <b>insemination,</b> are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{treatment}} of infertility generally {{involves the use}} of fertility medication, medical device, surgery, or a combination of the following. If the sperm are of good quality and the mechanics of the woman's reproductive structures are good (patent fallopian tubes, no adhesions or scarring), a course of ovarian stimulating medication maybe used. The physician or WHNP may also suggest using a conception cap cervical cap, which the patient uses at home by placing the sperm inside the cap and putting the conception device on the cervix, or <b>intrauterine</b> <b>insemination</b> (IUI), in which the doctor or WHNP introduces sperm into the uterus during ovulation, via a catheter. In these methods, fertilization occurs inside the body.|$|E

40|$|Background: Gynecological {{endocrinology}} {{and reproductive}} medicine within the reproductive health systems {{of developing countries}} is underappreciated and methods to incorporate basic infertility workup and treatment needs to be addressed. However, most recommendations of how to proceed in particular, though, are very general. We exemplarily report our approach in Eritrea. Methods: Two one-week intensive training courses on gynecological endocrinology and reproductive medicine (lectures and hands on training) were given 2011 and 2012 at the Orotta National Referral Maternity Hospital in Asmara, Eritrea. Important subjects included: education and training in contraception fertility awareness, methods to optimize fertility potential, utilization of vaginal ultrasound for cycle monitoring, performance of hysterocontrastsonograhy, and one-step semen preparation for <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations.</b> Results: After two intensive courses a basic infertility work up is possible with pelvic ultrasound assessment and contrastsonography for tubal patency. Simplified <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> after mild ovarian stimulation are possible as well and represent the first step into assisted reproduction. All procedures are feasible and performed independently by the trainees. Conclusions: Basic gynecological endocrinology and infertility care in resource-poor countries is possible. The Eritrean example of intensive courses with training in hysterocontrastsonography and one step <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> may encourage others to follow and introduce basic infertility care into other resource-poor countries...|$|R
50|$|In many situations, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> are {{performed}} with success.

50|$|Unlike ICI, <b>intrauterine</b> <b>insemination</b> {{normally}} {{requires a}} medical practitioner {{to perform the}} procedure. A female under 30 years of age has optimal chances with IUI; for the man, a TMS of more than 5 million per ml is optimal. In practice, donor sperm will satisfy these criteria. A promising cycle is one that offers two follicles measuring more than 16 mm, and estrogen of more than 500 pg/mL {{on the day of}} hCG administration. A short period of ejaculatory abstinence before <b>intrauterine</b> <b>insemination</b> is associated with higher pregnancy rates.

The exclusion criteria were: fixed retroverted uterus, rectovaginal endometriosis, pathological adnexa, pelvic inflammatory disease with Douglas involvement. The fertiloscopies were under local paracervical block, using the Soprane (TM) kit and a Wolf (TM) telescope of 2.7  mm, used also for the hysteroscopy step. In all cases a dye test was associated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{specially}} designed catheter {{may be used}} to insert specially washed sperm directly into the uterus for <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> (IUI). The procedure is normally carried out by a physician and has a better pregnancy rate than ICI insemination. This method is commonly offered by fertility clinics using donor sperm because the increased pregnancy rate results in fewer donor samples being used for the same number of pregnancies. Semen used for IUI must first be 'washed' to provide a pure sperm sample: this prevents 'cramping' following the insemination.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of infertility treatments. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center infertility practice. PATIENT(S) : All patients treated for infertility in a 1 -year time span. INTERVENTION(S) : <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations,</b> clomiphene citrate and IUI (CC-IUI), hMG and IUI (hMG-IUI), assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and neosalpingostomy by laparotomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : All medical charges and pregnancy outcomes {{associated with the}} treatments were obtained. Cost-effectiveness ratios defined as cost per delivery were determined for each procedure. The effects of a woman 2 ̆ 7 s age {{and the number of}} spermatozoa inseminated on cost-effectiveness of the procedures was also determined. RESULT(S) : <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations,</b> CC-IUI, and hMG-IUI have a similar cost per delivery of between 7, 800 and 10, 300. All of these were more cost-effective than ART, which had a cost per delivery of 37, 000. Assisted reproductive techniques in women with blocked fallopian tubes was more cost-effective than tubal surgery performed by laparotomy, which had a cost per delivery of 76, 000. Increasing age in women and lower numbers of spermatozoa inseminated were factors leading to higher costs per delivery for IUI, CC-IUI, hMG-IUI, and ART. Use of donor oocytes reduced the cost per delivery of older women to the range seen in younger women with ART. CONCLUSION(S) : Our analysis supports, in general, the use of IUI, CC-IUI, and hMG-IUI before ART in women with open fallopian tubes. For women with blocked fallopian tubes, IVF-ET appears to be the best treatment from a cost-effectiveness standpoint...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> (IUI) as first line treatment of unexplained or male factor infertility. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 414 consecutive IUI treatment cycles in 124 couples with unexplained or male factor infertility. RESULTS: In 414 cycles 25 pregnancies were achieved (6 % pregnancy rate per cycle and 20 % per couple respectively). 24 healthy babies were born (20 singletons and 2 twins) as a result of our treatment. There was no significant difference in ejaculate parameters of patients who achieved a pregnancy compared with patients who failed to do so. Lowest values at which pregnancies were achieved were 0. 8 mill sperm/ml and 11 % progressive motility after sperm processing and 8 % normal morphology before semen preparation. CONCLUSION: There is still a place for IUI as first line treatment for couples with unexplained or male factor infertility.

We want to draw attention, however, to one fact which we found to be confusing during appraisal of the data with its current presen-tation format. The ultimate purpose of ART is the delivery of a healthy infant at term, and the delivery rate is the most relevant outcome parameter that reflects the effectiveness of our practice. We appreciate that a report not including delivery rates will be defi-nitely incomplete and less useful to the reader. This notwithstanding...|$|R

40|$|Assisted {{reproduction}} has a minor but increasing {{influence on}} childbearing trends in advanced societies. In Denmark, {{the use of}} assisted reproduction technology (ART) has become particularly widespread. At the same time, Danish women born in the late 1950 s and the 1960 s experienced stabilization or even {{a slight increase in}} their mean number of children. Broad availability and widespread use of assisted reproduction may become important factors contributing to maintaining relatively high completed fertility among the younger cohorts of Danish women. To explore this idea, we analyze and project cohort trends in fertility rates among native Danish women born in 1960 - 78 and examine the likely contribution of assisted reproduction to these trends. The projected proportion of children born after ART treatment shows a substantial increase from 2. 1 percent among women born in 1965 to 4 - 5 percent among women born in 1978, with an estimated net impact of ART (as compared with the hypothetical situation where no ART treatment was available) on the order of 3 - 4 percent.

In fact the determination of the appropriate gonadotropins' starting dose to achieve only mono-follicular development is the most important issue in ovulation induction. This is the main goal to minimize cycle's cancellation due to low or high ovarian response and to prevent multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The objective of the trial was to determine the effect of different follitropin beta dose (50, 75 and 100 IU daily) on follicular development, thickness of the endometrium, total consumption of gonadotropins per cycle etc. We evaluated 90 cycles with ovarian stimulation for 90 patients with unexplained infertility, mild male factor or anovulatory disorder.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{questioned}} whether a laparoscopy {{should be performed}} after a normal hysterosalpingography before starting <b>intrauterine</b> <b>inseminations</b> (IUI) in order to detect further pelvic pathology and whether a postponed proce-dure after six unsuccessful cycles of IUI yields a higher number of abnormal findings. METHODS: In a randomized con-trolled trial, the accuracy of a standard laparoscopy prior to IUI was compared with a laparoscopy performed after six unsuccessful cycles of IUI. The major end-point {{was the number of}} diagnostic laparoscopies revealing pelvic pathol-ogy with consequence for further treatment such as laparoscopic surgical intervention, IVF or secondary surgery. Patients were couples with medical grounds for IUI such as idiopathic subfertility, mild male infertility and cervical hostility. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were randomized into the diagnostic laparoscopy first (DLSF) group and the same number was randomized into the IUI first (IUIF) group. The laparoscopy was performed on 64 patients in the DLSF group, 10 patients withdrew their consent from participation and three patients (3 %) became pregnant prior to laparoscopy. In the IUIF group, 23 patients remained for laparoscopy because pregnancy did not occur after six cycles of IUI. From the original 77 randomized patients, 38 patients became pregnant and 16 patients dropped out. Abnormal findings during laparoscopy with therapeutic consequences were the same in both groups: in the DLSF group, 31 cases (48 %) versus 13 cases (56 %) in the IUIF group, P = 0. 63; odds ratio (OR) = 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 5 – 3. 6.
