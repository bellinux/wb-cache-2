6000|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> twenty the cab {{had gone}} {{rattling}} {{up the street}} with both of them. And before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> twenty-three Grant had hissed in my ear: ...|$|E
60|$|How {{slowly the}} moments seemed to pass! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> {{them by the}} {{throbbing}} of my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} {{urge you to}} abandon him, dearest,' said Martin, 'though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> the years we are to wear out asunder. But the {{influence}} this fellow exercises over him has steadily increased, I fear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{year ago}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>counted</b> on hitting him where I liked. I trust I shall not blunder against his vitals now. However, if I do, he has himself to blame!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were lying}} four deep {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make out, master. I kept {{very close to the}} outside line. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>count</b> them {{accurately}} because of the trees, but I should say that there were about two hundred and fifty in a line." ...|$|R
50|$|I left {{my world}} to wander inthis endless midnight sky,for space {{is just a}} starry nightwhere no suns ever rise.There are no mornings like my world's,no shapes, no sounds, no signs.But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>count</b> the sunsThat my world's lost behind.|$|R
6000|$|CONRAD. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on {{nine hundred}} and sixty years I could make myself a real biologist, instead of what I am now: a child trying to walk. Are you sure you might not become a good clergyman {{if you had a}} few centuries to do it in? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, and why not?' Fettes thus vaunted himself. 'It was no {{affair of}} mine. There {{was nothing to}} gain {{on the one side}} but disturbance, and on the other <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on your gratitude, don't you see?' And he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang.|$|E
6000|$|... "Myself, of course. It is what I {{have thought}} myself. There is Count Samoval. He promised that if ever {{any such thing}} {{happened}} he would help me. And he assured me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> upon him. I think {{it may have been}} his offer that made me fanciful." ...|$|E
60|$|Just for {{an instant}} I fancied the red-coats wavered, and certain it is Abel Hunt nimbly sprang back behind the man at whose side he had been walking; but the {{soldiers}} themselves kept on, and before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>counted</b> five little Frenchie fired.|$|R
6000|$|... "'There {{was a dead}} silence. My {{throat and}} lips were dry; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not speak. <b>Count</b> Hirsfeld watched me with folded arms. It was his vengeance! ...|$|R
6000|$|I counted ten tails, {{but there}} were more than that, and if I had been quicker <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>counted</b> more. Presently they went down. And I, {{returning}} to earth and the business of fishing, discovered that during the excitement my sailfish had taken advantage of a perfectly loose line to free himself. Nine leaps we recorded him! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought for}} a moment. It {{was not a very}} long absence, but the new sights would {{distract}} me, and I wanted to see Florence again. On the whole, I thought it would suffice, and that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the cure of my ill before the time was up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, and why not?" [...] Fettes thus vaunted himself. [...] "It was no {{affair of}} mine. There {{was nothing to}} gain {{on the one side}} but disturbance, and on the other <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on your gratitude, don't you see?" [...] And he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it's you, is it, you wretched blight, you miserable weed!" [...] said Mr. Brewster, having {{recovered}} enough {{breath to}} be going on with. He glowered at his son-in-law despondently. [...] "I might have, expected it! If I was at the North Pole, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on you butting in!" ...|$|E
60|$|Only {{five men}} <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>count</b> on their feet, {{although}} {{there might have}} been sound ones below; but surely it was that they had suffered more than we.|$|R
60|$|It was yet early, and {{refreshing}} in the chequered shade. We plodded earnestly {{after our}} gaunt {{shadow in the}} dust, and ever downward, till at last we drew so near to the opposite steep that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> well nigh <b>count</b> its pines.|$|R
60|$|Though {{the buffalo}} {{appeared}} to be moving fast, a long time elapsed before they reached the foot of our outlook. They lumbered along in a compact mass, so dense that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>count</b> them, but I estimated the number at seventy-five. Frank was riding zigzag behind them, swinging his lariat and yelling. When he espied us he reined in his horse and waited. Then the herd slowed down, halted and began browsing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, Sir John! It is {{his mind}} that is more crooked than his back. He is a perilous man with women, for the Devil hath given him such a tongue and such an eye that he charms them even as the basilisk. Marriage may be in their mind, but never in his, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> a dozen and more whom he has led to their undoing. It is his pride and his boast over the whole countryside." ...|$|E
60|$|Sure enough, on {{the rise}} of a curve upon our right the four-in-hand had appeared, the horses {{stretched}} to the utmost. Our mares laid themselves out gallantly, and the distance between us began slowly to decrease. I found that I could see the black band upon Sir John's white hat, then that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> the folds of his cape; finally, that I could see the pretty features of his wife as she looked back at us.|$|E
60|$|Looking back as best I could, I {{began to}} discern {{somewhat}} {{to the left}} of us a numerous herd in pursuit, sorrel in colour, and of a more magnificent aspect than those forming the other bands. It was obvious, too, despite their plunging and rearing, that they were gaining on us--drew, indeed, so near at last that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> the foremost of them, and mark (not quite callously) their power and fleetness and symmetry, even the sun's gold upon their reddish skins.|$|E
60|$|With that he lugged out his dice and fetched a tablier, but {{presently}} {{vowed that}} it was plain robbery, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep no <b>count</b> of the game. Therewith he left me, laughing and mocking, and saying that I had been bolder with Robin Lindsay's lass.|$|R
60|$|I at once {{resolved}} {{to put this}} suspicion of her to the test. Leaving the bridge, I had only to cross the road beyond, and to enter a plantation {{on the bank of}} the river. Here, concealed behind the first tree which was large enough to hide me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> command a view of the bridge, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fairly <b>count</b> on detecting her, if she returned to the river, while there was a ray of light to see her by. It was not easy walking in the obscurity of the plantation: I had almost to grope my way to the nearest tree that suited my purpose.|$|R
40|$|I gratefully {{acknowledge}} Dr. Lisa Meulbroek for her continued guidance and support during {{the writing of}} this thesis as well as throughout {{the past two years}} of my research assistance. Whenever I needed advice on any issue ranging from running an event study to making a job offer decision, I knew that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>count</b> on Professor Meulbroek to shed some light on the problem at hand. I thank Dr. William Brown, Dr. Janet Smith, and Brian Dennis for their advice and interest. During the work on my thesi...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} how any {{can be so}} hardy as to use such words {{regarding}} these sublime men, who are the very pillars of the French state, supporting it with their strength and preserving it at daily cost of their blood. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> myself honored past all deserving if I might be allowed but the privilege of looking upon them onceÂ—at a distance, I mean, for it would not become one of my degree to approach them too near." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the {{intervening}} five {{years had been}} years of vigorous activity for me, if not of very remarkable growth. When I saw her again, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> myself a grown man. I think, indeed, I counted myself more completely grown than I was. At any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had [...] "got on" [...] very well, and my ideas, {{if they had not}} changed very greatly, had become much more definite and my ambitions clearer and bolder.|$|E
60|$|Like a naughty child I {{had been}} put {{in the corner and}} then sent to bed. Good. There could be no going back now. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on Fanny--the one thing she asked was to be free of me. As for Mrs Monnerie, her flushed and sullen countenance {{convinced}} me that my respite would be undisturbed. There was only impulsive Susan to think of. And as if in answer, there came a faint tap, and the door softly opened to admit her gentle head and shoulders.|$|E
60|$|I {{was pretty}} tired, {{and the first}} thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright <b>I</b> <b>could</b> a <b>counted</b> the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, {{hundreds}} of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELT late. You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{went into}} the city to look upon the face of every man. But they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>count</b> them. And the noise smote upon me till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not hear, and my head was dizzy with much movement. So I went on and on, through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine; where the harvests lay rich on the plains; and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women, with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold. And all the while my people of Akatan hunted and fished, and were happy in {{the thought that the}} world was small.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha!' {{said the}} old man, 'to be sure--when? How many weeks ago? <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>count</b> them on my fingers? Let them rest though; they're better gone.' 'Much better, dear,' replied the child. 'We will forget them; or, if we ever call them to mind, it shall be only as some uneasy dream that has passed away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{leave you}} alone, if you like," [...] she decided, tossing her {{cigarette}} into the grate. [...] "If my friendship isn't worth having, let it go. It hasn't often been offered in vain. There are more men in London than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> {{who would go}} down on their knees for such a visit as I am paying you. And you--you," [...] she added, with a little tremble of real anger in her tone, [...] "you're too hatefully polite and priggish! Come and ring the bell for the lift. I am going!" ...|$|E
60|$|That intolerably keen {{instinct}} of his {{seemed to}} have anticipated my scheme: he {{met me at the}} threshold, hurried me into the room, and fixed me in a minute in my former seat. Taking the plate of fruit from my hand, he divided the portion intended only for himself, and ordered me to eat my share. I complied with no good grace, and vexed, I suppose, by my reluctance, he opened a masked and dangerous battery. All he had yet said, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> as mere sound and fury, signifying nothing: not so of the present attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Color in her cheeks!" [...] snorted Miss Roxy; [...] "so does a rock-maple get {{color in}} September and turn all scarlet, and what for? why, the frost {{has been at}} it, and its time is out. That's what your bright colors stand for. Hain't you noticed that little gravestone cough, jest the faintest in the world, and it don't come from a cold, and it hangs on. I tell you you can't cheat me, she's goin' jest as Mehitabel went, jest as Sally Ann Smith went, jest as Louisa Pearson went. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> now on my fingers twenty girls that have gone that way. Nobody saw 'em goin' till they was gone." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{drew her}} chair into the firelight, and sounded a whistle which she took {{from the pocket}} of her dress. In another moment the lithe and shadowy figures of the cats {{appeared}} noiselessly in the red light, answering their mistress's call. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>count</b> six of them, as the creatures seated themselves demurely in a circle round the chair. Peter followed with the harp, and closed the door after him as he went out. The streak of daylight being now excluded from the room, Miss Dunross threw back her veil, and took the harp on her knee; seating herself, I observed, with her face turned away from the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll explain," [...] said Nevis. [...] "The fact is, Lansing let us {{in rather}} badly. We {{spent a good deal}} of money over this concession, and we're anxious to get it back. Since we can't float the thing on the market at present, we have formed a small private {{syndicate}} to develop the property, though we may sell out in a year or two if you can make the undertaking commercially successful. <b>I</b> think you <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the purchasers' continuing operations." ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{head teacher}} {{concluded}} class, assigned homework for the holiday, and then counted the students diligently. As {{soon as we}} were dismissed we ran to the school gate, like a flood rushes to the valley. I was the fastest among the students. At the gate, I turned {{and waited for the}} next student. I counted who was second, third, and so on. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>count</b> from one to twenty when I was nine so I quickly lost interest. It was around six PM on a summer day in 2003 when I headed home on foot alone. We live in a tent in summer and my home was about four hours away on the grassland in Gad dmar. ...|$|R
