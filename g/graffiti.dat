5|$|Fischer-Elfert distinguishes ancient Egyptian <b>graffiti</b> {{writing as}} a {{literary}} genre. During the New Kingdom, scribes who traveled to ancient sites often left <b>graffiti</b> messages {{on the walls of}} sacred mortuary temples and pyramids, usually in commemoration of these structures. Modern scholars do not consider these scribes to have been mere tourists, but pilgrims visiting sacred sites where the extinct cult centers could be used for communicating with the gods. There is evidence from an educational ostracon found in the tomb of Senenmut (TT71) that formulaic <b>graffiti</b> writing was practiced in scribal schools. In one <b>graffiti</b> message, left at the mortuary temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahri, a modified saying from The Maxims of Ptahhotep is incorporated into a prayer written on the temple wall. Scribes usually wrote their <b>graffiti</b> in separate clusters to distinguish their <b>graffiti</b> from others'. This led to competition among scribes, who would sometimes denigrate the quality of <b>graffiti</b> inscribed by others, even ancestors from the scribal profession.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the tombs}} have <b>graffiti</b> written by these ancient tourists. Jules Baillet has located over 2,100 Greek and Latin {{instances}} of <b>graffiti,</b> {{along with a}} smaller number in Phoenician, Cypriot, Lycian, Coptic, and other languages. The majority of the ancient <b>graffiti</b> is found in KV9, which contains just under a thousand of them. The earliest positively dated <b>graffiti</b> dates to 278 B.C.|$|E
5|$|One poorly studied area of Maya {{folk art}} is <b>graffiti.</b> Additional <b>graffiti,</b> {{not part of}} the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of {{interior}} walls, floors, and benches, {{in a wide variety of}} buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. <b>Graffiti</b> has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of <b>graffiti</b> has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. <b>Graffiti</b> was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.|$|E
5|$|A sequel, More American <b>Graffiti,</b> was {{released}} in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Empty shoe polish bottles {{can be used}} {{to create}} <b>graffiti,</b> by dumping out the polish inside and filling it full of ink or paint. They are used as a cheap {{alternative}} to markers designed for <b>graffiti,</b> and are much more widely available. Kiwi polish was also used heavily by the U.S. Military.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis {{buildings}} contain inscribed <b>graffiti</b> {{dating to}} the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic, including human and animal figures, deities, temples and courtly scenes. Colonial <b>graffiti</b> is also evident from the visit to the ruins by captain Pedro Montañés {{in the middle of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis is also {{distinguished}} {{by a great}} quantity of <b>graffiti</b> inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill. The <b>graffiti</b> is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis, during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and human figures, {{some of which are}} playing musical instruments. Animals depicted in the <b>graffiti</b> include a deer, a turtle and a frog. Two human figures are depicted playing flutes, while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} success of <b>Graffiti</b> also gave Lucas opportunities to establish more elaborate development for Lucasfilm, Skywalker Sound, and Industrial Light & Magic. Based {{on the success}} of the 1977 reissue, Universal began production for the sequel More American <b>Graffiti</b> (1979). Lucas and writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz later collaborated on Radioland Murders (1994), also released by Universal Pictures, for which Lucas acted as executive producer. The film features characters intended to be Curt and Laurie Henderson's parents, Roger and Penny Henderson. In 1995 American <b>Graffiti</b> was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1997 the city of Modesto, California, honored Lucas with a statue dedication of American <b>Graffiti</b> at George Lucas Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Better Out Than In was a {{residency}} {{undertaken by}} pseudonymous <b>graffiti</b> artist and political activist Banksy in New York City during October 2013. Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil <b>graffiti</b> and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} minor damage, such as <b>graffiti,</b> may {{be dealt with}} by the issue of fixed penalty notices as an {{alternative}} to prosecution.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 2010, Oliver Fricker trespassed and vandalised car 1048 (trainset 047/048) with <b>graffiti</b> at Changi Depot. The <b>graffiti</b> was {{initially}} mistaken for an advertisement {{and was not}} spotted until the car was filmed and the video was uploaded to YouTube by a trainspotter. Fricker was {{convicted and sentenced to}} seven months' imprisonment and caning. The public perceived this incident to have serious security implications, as the depot was considered a sensitive installation.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{family members}} painted {{signatures}} and <b>graffiti</b> {{in the attic}} around 1856, which remain visible on the stairwell wall.|$|E
5|$|The Premio <b>Graffiti</b> {{is awarded}} {{annually}} by media members specialized {{in music and}} entertainment in Uruguay. Drexler has received one award from eight nominations.|$|E
5|$|The Prison Gallery showcases {{and offers}} for sale the artworks {{of current and}} ex-prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other {{exhibits}} related {{to the history of}} the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century forger James Walsh, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. Painting or drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though <b>graffiti,</b> which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases – including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells – but only for work considered art and not <b>graffiti.</b> Art, or art therapy, was not officially permitted until the 1980s; <b>graffiti</b> was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a series}} of Arabic <b>graffiti</b> {{on the walls of the}} temple, dated 9th-10th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{alphabet}} {{is used by}} approximately 16,000,000 people to write the Sinhalese language in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, <b>graffiti,</b> and schoolbooks.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} {{conclusion was}} reached in Hardman v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary (1986), where <b>graffiti,</b> although eventually removable by action of rainfall, was actually washed {{away by the}} local authority, incurring expense, was held to be criminal damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{after the}} end of the Civil War, {{supporters}} of the victorious Franco side started an attempt to topple the tree, but were repelled by local people. It has also been subject to regular minor damage such as anti-Catalan <b>graffiti.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lucas and {{producer}} Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed American <b>Graffiti</b> was not violent or sexual {{enough for the}} studio's standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control {{and the right of}} final cut privilege on the condition that he make American <b>Graffiti</b> on a strict, low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene, in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.|$|E
5|$|On December 6, 2016, Whitlock's Moonachie, New Jersey {{home was}} subject to {{vandalism}} with racially charged <b>graffiti.</b> The perpetrator broke into his home, graffiti-ed several racial slurs and swastikas on his walls, and stole jewelry and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{were brought up}} by the public when two incidents of vandalism at train depots occurred within two years. In both incidents, <b>graffiti</b> on the affected trains were discovered after they entered revenue service.|$|E
5|$|South of Egypt, a stele bearing Sahure's {{name was}} {{discovered}} in the diorite quarries located in the desert north-west of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia. Even further south, Sahure's cartouche {{has been found in}} a <b>graffiti</b> in Tumas and on seal impressions from Buhen at the second cataract of the Nile.|$|E
5|$|THX 1138 was {{released}} in March 1971 and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct Lady Ice (1973), Tommy (1975) or Hair (1979). He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct. During this time, Lucas conceived {{the idea for a}} space opera (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his Star Wars franchise. At the May 1971 Cannes Film Festival, THX was chosen for the Directors' Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by American <b>Graffiti</b> and Lucas's space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop <b>Graffiti</b> as a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Radioland Murders came from {{executive}} producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline {{of the film}} during the writing phase of American <b>Graffiti,</b> viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda jerks solving a murder in a radio station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American <b>Graffiti</b> in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio first look deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually {{became the basis for}} Star Wars).|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related <b>graffiti</b> and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E
5|$|Allison Road is to {{take place}} in a haunted townhouse in the United Kingdom and feature a male protagonist who {{attempts}} to unravel the mystery behind his missing family over five nights. In the demo, some wall <b>graffiti</b> directly alludes to P.T. by repeating a statement made in the game. The Park, a spin-off game from The Secret World, has a sequence inspired by P.T., and the horror game Layers of Fear was heavily inspired by P.T. as well.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that <b>graffiti</b> and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Common motifs of the Parthian period include {{scenes of}} royal hunting expeditions and the {{investiture}} of Arsacid kings. Use of these motifs extended to include portrayals of local rulers. Common art mediums were rock-reliefs, frescos, and even <b>graffiti.</b> Geometric and stylized plant patterns {{were also used}} on stucco and plaster walls. The common motif of the Sassanid period showing two horsemen engaged in combat with lances {{first appeared in the}} Parthian reliefs at Mount Behistun.|$|E
5|$|Crass spray-painted stencilled <b>graffiti</b> {{messages}} in the London Underground system and on advertising billboards, coordinated squats and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing {{and using a}} stage backdrop amalgamating icons of perceived authority such as the Christian cross, the swastika, the Union Jack and the ouroboros.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of <b>graffiti</b> scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of <b>graffiti</b> the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Feeling lonely, Natasha {{goes out}} {{clubbing}} and meets Ivan DeMarco (Ben Knight), an older man. Michael discovers {{the relationship and}} bans Natasha from seeing Ivan. However, Natasha continues {{to see him in}} secret and when Ivan asks her for some naked pictures, she sends him some. Natasha learns Ivan has been showing the pictures to his friends and that they are on the internet. She initially lies to Michael about who took the photos, but Michael learns the truth from Ivan. Natasha becomes desperate to win her father's favour back and she sprays the street with derogatory <b>graffiti</b> about herself. However, Michael discovers she was responsible for the <b>graffiti</b> and he disowns her. After she is taunted about her appearance, Natasha decides to get rhinoplasty and uses Michael's credit card to pay the deposit. Natasha then sells some of her father's records to raise the money and Michael decides to send her to a boarding school. He changes his mind after Natasha nearly drowns in the pool at Number 30 and their relationship begins to improve.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{students}} from the Art Institute of Portland used stencils to advertise a concert for the Oregon Food Bank. The students believed they were using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned they were actually using spray paint. The students were told that even temporary markings count as <b>graffiti,</b> and the students offered to remove the paint and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, {{the written}} use of Latin had {{replaced}} Oscan—like Latin, an Italic language—and Etruscan {{by the end}} of the 1st century AD. Oscan <b>graffiti</b> are preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD at Pompeii, which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63. In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen antiquarian interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but the work has not survived.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as <b>graffiti</b> were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{spent the}} rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise {{financing}} for the American <b>Graffiti</b> script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end American <b>Graffiti</b> showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.|$|E
