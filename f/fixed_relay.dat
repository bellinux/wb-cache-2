50|$|Fixed relays (illustrated in Figure 1b) are {{low-cost}} {{and fixed}} radio infrastructures without wired backhaul connections. They store data {{received from the}} BS and forward to the mobile stations (MSs), and vice versa. <b>Fixed</b> <b>relay</b> stations (RSs) typically have smaller transmission powers and coverage areas than a BS. They can be deployed strategically and cost effectively in cellular networks to extend coverage, reduce total transmission power, enhance the capacity of a specific region with high traffic demands, and/or improve signal reception. By combining the signals from the relays and possibly the source signal from the BS, the mobile station (MS) is able to exploit the inherent diversity of the relay channel. The disadvantages of fixed relays are the additional delays introduced in the relaying process, and the potentially increased levels of interference due to frequency reuse at the RSs. As {{one of the most}} mature Cooperative MIMO technologies, <b>fixed</b> <b>relay</b> has attracted significant support in major cellular communication standards.|$|E

50|$|Mobile <b>relays</b> {{differ from}} <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> {{in the sense}} that the RSs are mobile and are not {{deployed}} as the infrastructure of a network. Mobile relays are therefore more flexible in accommodating varying traffic patterns and adapting to different propagation environments. For example, when a target MS temporarily suffers from poor channel conditions or requires relatively high-rate service, its neighboring MSs can help to provide multi-hop coverage or increase the data rate by relaying information to the target MS. Moreover, mobile relays enable faster and lower-cost network rollout. Similar to <b>fixed</b> <b>relays,</b> mobile relays can enlarge the coverage area, reduce the overall transmit power, and/or increase the capacity at cell edges. On the other hand, due to their opportunistic nature, mobile relays are less reliable than <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> since the network topology is highly dynamic and unstable.|$|R
30|$|The idea of {{relaying}} {{has attracted}} high interest {{over the last}} decade as a solution for improving coverage in cellular networks. One way to realize relay-based solutions is through installation of dedicated ‘helper’ nodes, which are also known as <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> or infrastructure relays.

When the number of users and RBs is growing, the proposed algorithm gives valuable performances enhancement compared to solutions without relay with the <b>fixed</b> <b>relay</b> selection strategies. With the joint relay selection strategy, power consumption is even lower. This strategy is more flexible and thus better benefits from frequency and multi-user diversity. However, its complexity is higher, and it incurs additional overhead. Comparing the average power per user type (relay, relayed source and non-relayed source) and their location in the cell allows to conclude that the sub-optimal <b>fixed</b> <b>relay</b> strategy achieves a good compromise between transmit power decrease and complexity.|$|E

This paper investigates distributed decodeand-forward <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> (infrastructure-based relaying) which are engaged in cooperation in a two-hop wireless network as a means of removing the burden of multiple antennas on wireless terminals. In contrast to mobile terminals, the deployment of a small number of antennas on infrastructure-based <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> is feasible, thus, the paper examines the impact of multiple antennas on the performance of the distributed cooperative <b>fixed</b> <b>relays.</b> Threshold-based maximal ratio combining (MRC) and thresholdbased selection combining (SC) of these multiple antenna signals are studied and analyzed. It is found that the end-to-end (E 2 E) error performance of a network which has few relays with many antennas is not significantly worse than that which has many relays each with a fewer antennas. Obviously, the former network has a tremendous deployment cost advantage over the latter. It is also observed that the E 2 E error performance of a network in which the multiple antennas at relays are configured in SC fashion is not significantly worse than that in which MRC is used. For implementation, SC presents a significantly lower complexity and cost than a full-blown MRC.

Two models for AF, namely, fixed gain and <b>fixed</b> power <b>relaying,</b> have been extensively studied. In <b>fixed</b> gain <b>relaying,</b> the <b>relay</b> gain is <b>fixed</b> but its transmit power varies {{as a function of}} the source-relay (SR) channel gain.

The incorporation of two-hop <b>fixed</b> <b>relays,</b> which are connected to base-stations via wireless backhaul, provides a convenient solution toward such a goal. In particular, cooperative relaying in wireless networks is an attractive solution for extending base station coverage and filling coverage gaps that affect user equipment’s performance in the strongly shadowed urban environment.

40|$|Although radio {{repeaters}} {{and wireless}} routers are commonly used, relaying techniques {{have received a}} lot of attention in academic publications the last decade. Most of the techniques proposed in the literature are based on relaying terminals. For instance groups of mobile terminals cooperate so as to jointly communicate with an access point, or to another group of mobiles in an (infrastructure-less) mobile ad-hoc network MANET. However, it has also been suggested that these techniques can be applied to hybrid cellular-relaying architecture with <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> and that this would reduce the infrastructure costs. The literature shows that the coverage or capacity of a cellular network is enhanced when using relays. A common assumption in these studies is that relays are very low cost, but little attention has been given to how cheap these relays need to be in order for the technical enhancements to translate into an economic gain. It is not obvious that the techniques proposed for mobile relaying are economically feasible when applied to <b>fixed</b> <b>relays.</b> This thesis examines the conditions under which large scale usage of <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> leads to lower infrastructure cost than in a purely cellular architecture, how large the benefits of these new techniques are, compared with existing repeater/router techniques, and how sensitive the results are to traditional network design parameters. The analysis is done by means of several study cases in which coverage should be provided for broadband services by building a network from scratch. The results are expressed in terms of how cheap a relay must be with respect to a base station's cost so that the hybrid infrastructure provides the desired service at a lower cost. If in practice this relative relay cost is much lower, then high economic gains are expected. None of the study cases considered yield substantial cost savings when using <b>fixed</b> <b>relays</b> on a large scale. When access points are placed as high as in a cellular network, the hybrid system is feasible only if the total relay cost is 3 - 20 % of the total base station cost. When unplanned relay deployment is used, the impact of the antenna height and/or gain on the results is much greater than the particular type of amplify-and-forward relaying scheme. Planned deployment of a few relays should be used unless the cost of planning is 1 - 2 times larger than all the other relay costs. A proper trade-off between route-length and how tight the radio channel can be reused is essential for the feasibility of the hybrid system. The results confirm that the planned usage of few relays together with macro-like base stations is an efficient way of providing coverage. Analysis of other scenarios, {{such as the use of}} pico base stations for coverage, is left for further studies. QC 2010112...|$|R
