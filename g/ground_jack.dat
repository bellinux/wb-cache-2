This includes Gwen's father, who awakes in time to hear his wife wishing him goodbye over the phone. At the same time both of the Blessing sites begin to shake, making the structure around them unstable.

In addition, the basal diet was pair-fed to groups of chicks at the level of feed intake of chicks fed the 10 % RJB diet. Each diet was fed to six groups of six chicks for 6 wk.

40|$|In the {{construction}} of artificial ground in over-track space, building temporary sheds and frequent recabling shown in Fig. 1 (a) cause cost increases. Thus, we developed a jack-down construction method that enables cost reduction and work period shortening by omitting temporary sheds and reducing recabling for those sheds (Fig. 1 (b)). Specifically, artificial ground is built at the height that does not inter-fere with existing sheds using sockets modularized with column-beam joints of an outer diaphragm type shown in Fig. 2. Then, the <b>ground</b> is <b>jacked</b> down to a specified height after removing existing sheds, and finally it is jointed with columns by filling in the gaps between columns and sockets with mortar or concrete. We assumed that socket joints are used only for cylindrical steel pipe columns; so, we created a formula to calculate ultimate strength applicable to such columns only.

50|$|The gun car was {{positioned}} over the pit, the wheels were locked and the platform was locked into position with gun mount and car's weight {{shifted from the}} trucks (bogies) directly to the <b>ground</b> by <b>jacks</b> and lifting screws. The rails were removed from above the pit because the gun breech was too wide to pass between them. The gun could elevate up to 43°, which gave it a maximum range of 42,000 yards (23.8 miles/38.4 km), and could be traversed 2.5° left and right of center. Any greater change of direction required the gun to be moved forward or backward along its curved track and a new recoil pit dug. The gun used the standard naval gun mounting and recoil system, {{with the addition of}} a pneumatic system to assist the runout springs to return the gun to firing position after recoil at the higher maximum elevation of 43° compared to maximum 30° in naval use.|$|R
50|$|With Jack {{forced to}} pick and choose his words, {{communicating}} with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline (Kerry Washington). She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to him not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron (Clark Duke) realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jack's house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose lots of leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the <b>ground</b> does <b>Jack</b> stop speaking.|$|R
