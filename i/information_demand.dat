40|$|Process {{roles are}} used to {{structure}} complex engineering processes in single sys-tems development for many years. Typically, each role has specific responsi-bilities from which certain <b>information</b> <b>demands</b> originate. In the engineering of variable software, role-specific <b>information</b> <b>demands</b> affect variability in-formation. To control the access to the variability information, we suggest us-ing the concepts of an explicit access control model. We integrate an access control model and a variability modeling language on a conceptual level. Ad-ditionally, we extend the variability modeling language by formally defined operations. Based on this extension, we propose a formal integration of an ac-cess control model and the variability modeling language. Our solution allows to explicitly define access control to variability information on a formal basis. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{organizations}} {{face the}} challenge of having to manage an increasing amount of information. The resulting information overload leads more and more to problems in decision making with potentially negative economic consequences.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two main purposes: first, it studies {{the impact of}} {{election}} closeness on political <b>information</b> <b>demand</b> and supply; second, it provides evidence on mass media behaviour during electoral campaigns.

Mass media are modeled as profit-maximizing firms that take into account <b>information</b> <b>demand,</b> the value of customers to advertisers and the marginal cost of customers. Information supply should be larger in constituencies where the contest {{is expected to be}} closer, there is an higher population density, and population is on average more valuable to advertisers (for example richer, better educated etc.).

Some Aspects of Training at the Department Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskap of the Swedish University of Växjö" The terms <b>Information</b> Seeking, <b>Information</b> <b>Demands,</b> <b>Information</b> Behaviour and Information Literacy are {{discussed}} from an international {{as well as}} Scandinavian point of view. Therefore the difference between Information Seek and Information Literacy is shown. Information Literacy is explained to be a personal characteristic dependend on the different surrounding environmental conditions. The field where this competence has to be taught is shown exemplary by a potential Information Seeking process of a student in a library. Here the librarian inheres a key role, focussing in a user- service provider- relationship on the <b>information</b> <b>demands</b> of the individual person and assisting to the search strategy.

40|$|Abstract. Enterprise Architecture (EA) {{management}} {{seeks to}} align business and IT while realizing cost saving potentials, improving availability and fault tolerance, and increasing flexibility of an organization. Regarding these objectives, decision makers {{need to be}} supported with solid and relevant models about the organization’s architecture to guide the future development of the EA. In practice, many EA initiatives struggle with inflexible models not meeting the <b>information</b> <b>demand</b> of stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a solution that empowers stakeholders to reveal their <b>information</b> <b>demand</b> collaboratively to facilitate EA models that evolve with changing information demands at runtime. We present core concepts of our approach and insights of an implementation thereof as foundation to achieve our long-term goal of evolving EA models. In our implementation we extend a collaboration platform with capabilities to monitor the actual <b>information</b> <b>demand</b> and to maintain the EA model referring to this demand at runtime...|$|E
