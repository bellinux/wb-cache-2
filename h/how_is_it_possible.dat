25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> {{to speak of a}} gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true {{if it would be}} accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is “given” to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} that {{project is to}} review the range of {{communication}} possibilities of metaphor, pattern and symbol. New conceptual tools are required to configure very large quantities of information into patterns that are both memorable and meaningful, and metaphor is often the only means to deal comprehensibly with complexity. Moreover, exploring “new ways of thinking” {{in the light of}} enhanced mental imagery (or mental model) appears indispensable inasmuch as furthering “mobilization of public opinion” and the “political will to change” is dependent upon insights that are too complex to be easily communicable. For instance, limitations of dualistic thinking are well-known and holistic approaches may represent more desirable alternatives, but <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to implement such alternatives? The page Challenge: transcending the [...] "switch" [...] metaphor deals with that question.|$|E

This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve never heard anything by her that I didn’t realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across.

2500|$|Several {{prominent}} writers {{expressed a}} similar [...] "culture of poverty" [...] argument.

[...] Meanwhile, in an article published in Commentary entitled [...] "How the Rioters Won", conservative columnist Midge Decter referred to African-American city youths and asked [...] "ow is it possible to go on declaring that what will save the young men of South-Central L.A., and the young girls they impregnate, and the illegitimate babies they sire, is jobs? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to look at these boys of the underclass ... and imagine that they either want or could hold on to jobs?" ...|$|E

It turns out that some of the numbers coincide completely with natural laws – the position of the moon at certain times and so on. And it makes you think: <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> that those ancient people built something so scientifically complex? They must have had something that we don't, even though we always think that we're a lot more advanced than they were. Take Rembrandt and van Gogh: who can match them today? When I think that way, I'm increasingly convinced that everything is actually possible. If they managed to do the impossible nearly five thousand years ago, why can't we do it today? That applies equally to football, but also to something like the Cruyff Courts and school sports grounds. My fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow. They are there to teach young people that sports and games can also be translated into everyday life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks {{states that}} in Judaism humility is an {{appreciation}} of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues. [...] It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. [...] Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness one is and what one can achieve. [...] Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important. [...] In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, [...] "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man {{on the face of}} the earth." [...] <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater. [...] It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.|$|E
