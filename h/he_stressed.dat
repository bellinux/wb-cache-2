5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|While in Berlin on May 25, 2017, Obama made a joint public {{appearance}} with Chancellor Angela Merkel where <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin {{while still in}} office {{as part of an}} effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{experimental}} {{evidence of the}} contribution of stress induced traps to Substrate Hot Electron (SHE) injection. We investigate the energy distribution of traps generated by Fowler Nordheim (FN) and Hot Electron (<b>HE)</b> <b>stress</b> {{with the aid of}} simulations and experiments. Results suggest that <b>HE</b> <b>stress</b> generates more oxide traps at high energy with respect to FN stress. The comparison between experiments and simulations also provides a new additional evidence of the inelastic nature of the trap assisted tunneling mechanism...|$|R

5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
5|$|Having taken charge Huggins did not {{shy away}} from making {{personnel}} changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees {{in the art of}} the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a move that led to criticism in the press.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Skeen Committee {{was set up}} {{to examine}} the options for the Indianisation of the Indian Army's officer ranks. As Cariappa {{was one of the most}} senior Indian {{officers}} with about 19 years of service, the committee held several discussions with him. He expressed his displeasure at the treatment of Indian officers in the Army. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> the discrimination shown toward Indian officers in terms of appointments, promotions, benefits and allowances to which British officers were entitled but Indians were not.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> {{that even if the}} lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Kenneth Craik {{had noted}} {{the ability of}} thought to predict events. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> the {{survival}} value of natural selection for this ability. This internal working model allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.|$|E
5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E

5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued {{common sense and}} fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} of Periyar continued {{when he went}} to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. There <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi. Five years later, Periyar travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. Nearing Periyar's last years, an award was given to him by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and it was presented to him by the Union Education Minister, Triguna Sen in Madras (Chennai), on 27 June 1970. In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Periyar {{died at the age of}} 94.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still {{holding on to the}} Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. <b>He</b> <b>stressed</b> that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E
25|$|Percival {{would later}} deliver {{a series of}} lectures on his {{experiences}} in Ireland in which <b>he</b> <b>stressed</b> the importance of surprise and offensive action, intelligence-gathering, maintaining security and co-operation between the security forces.|$|E

50|$|Niyamasara {{effectively}} removes doubts {{related to}} Parayayarthika naya and Dravyarthika nayas and elaborates on Vyavahara caritra. <b>He</b> <b>stresses</b> that Vyavahara caritra {{is based on}} samyama (self-restraint) and hence rooted in appropriate psychic disposition. He places great emphasis on cleansing the soul of vibhavas, internal impurities, through self-discipline.|$|R
