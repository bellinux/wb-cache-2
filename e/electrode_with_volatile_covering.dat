40|$|Piezoelectrics {{have been}} widely used in {{different}} kinds of applications, from the automobile industry to consumer electronics. The novel multilayer piezoelectrics, which are inspired by multilayer ceramic capacitors, not only minimize the size of the functional parts, but also maximize energy efficiency. Development of multilayer piezoelectric devices is at a significant crossroads on the way to achieving low costs, high efficiency, and excellent reliability. Concerning the costs of manufacturing multilayer piezoelectrics, the trend is to replace the costly noble metal internal <b>electrodes</b> <b>with</b> base metal materials. This paper discusses the materials development of metal co-firing and the progress of integrating current base metal chemistries. There are some significant considerations in metal co-firing multilayer piezoelectrics: retaining stoichiometry <b>with</b> <b>volatile</b> Pb and alkaline elements in ceramics, the selection of appropriate sintering agents to lower the sintering temperature with minimum impact on piezoelectric performance, and designing effective binder formulation for low pO 2 burnout to prevent oxidation of Ni and Cu base metal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a narrow kerf width under a clean process environment. However, the thinner wire is challenging process with a normal round shape wire electrode. Therefore, a new wire <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> track-shaped section was proposed {{in order to satisfy}} both the narrow kerf width and the high wire tension even in the case of thin wire electrode. In this study, the running control of wire <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> track-shaped section was experimentally investigated, and the possibility of proposed process was discussed. A brass coated steel wire <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> track-shaped section of aspect ratio 1 : 2 could perform the smaller vibration and the stable running up to 300 m/min. The side support method with fixture plates could improve the running stability of brass coated steel wire <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> track-shaped section and reduce the kerf width.

40|$|A novel {{electrode}} {{was constructed}} and {{tested in a}} bio-battery. This configuration consisted of a composite <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> immobilized bacteria (Escherichia coli K- 12) in the anode and a composite <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> immobilized Carbon Nanoparticles (CNP) and algae (Chlorella vulgaris/Scenedesmus sp.) suspended in the cathode. The composite electrode consisted of three parts: a 304 L stainless steel mesh base, an electro-polymerized layer of pyrrole, and an electro-polymerized layer of methylene blue. The bacteria were immobilized on the anode electrode using a technique incorporating CNP and a Teflontm emulsion. The anode and cathode electrodes were tested separately in conjunction with chemical cathodes and anodes respectively. The composite <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> immobilized bacteria was tested in a bioanode setup. The cathode chamber of the cell contained a potassium ferricyanide and buffer solution <b>with</b> a graphite <b>electrode.</b> Factors affecting electrode performance, such as Teflontm and carbon nanoparticle concentration, were investigated to find optimum values. The maximum power density generated by the composite <b>electrode</b> <b>with</b> immobilized bacteria and a chemical cathode was 378 mW/m 2. This electrode configuration produced approximately 69 % more power density and 53 % more current density than composite <b>electrodes</b> <b>with</b> bacteria suspended in solution. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy analysis determined that {{a significant portion of}} the bio-batteryâ€™s resistance to charge transfer occurred at the surface of the anode and this resistance was significantly lowered when using immobilized bacteria (51 % lower than bio-batteries with suspended bacteria).

Here we explore a critical question on the ideal annulus height to ensure electrical stimulation will be safe and effective. We implanted single electrodes into the motor cortex of anesthetized rats and measured the current required to evoke a motor response to stimulation, and the charge injection capacity of the electrodes. We compared platinum iridium <b>electrodes</b> <b>with</b> different annulus heights, with and without a coating of porous titanium nitride. Threshold charge densities to evoke a motor response ranged from 12 - 36 ÂµC. cm^- 2. ph^- 1. <b>Electrodes</b> <b>with</b> larger geometric surface areas required higher currents to evoke responses, but lower charge densities. The addition of a porous titanium nitride coating did not significantly influence the current required to evoke a motor response.
