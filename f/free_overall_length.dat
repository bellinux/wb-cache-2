25|$|The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, {{in which}} the receiver, bolt carrier group and {{magazine}} are placed behind the pistol grip.

The [...]338 Norma Magnum loaded with 19.44 g (300 gr) [...]338 caliber Sierra HPBT projectiles will have these projectile less deeply seated compared to the [...]338 Lapua Magnum when both cartridges are loaded to 91.44 mm (3.681 in) <b>overall</b> <b>length.</b> To achieve this the [...]338 Norma Magnum cartridge utilizes a shorter case (about 63.30 mm (2.492 in)) with less taper and a slightly sharper shoulder angle with a slightly longer neck, resulting in about 6.5% less case capacity. However the cartridge <b>overall</b> <b>lengths</b> of the [...]338 Norma Magnum and [...]338 Lapua Magnum are currently (2013) determined at 93.50 mm (3.681 in) by the C.I.P. rulings for these cartridges.|$|R

50|$|Later hyper-velocity rounds were {{introduced}} by other makers, {{based on the}} long rifle case with lighter bullets in the 30-gr weight range and slow-burning rifle powder loadings. The <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> {{of many of these}} cartridges was less than the <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> of the standard long rifle cartridge.

50|$|Both were bullpup-style weapons; the {{magazine}} and chamber are placed behind the trigger and pistol grip, leading to a shorter <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> (by about 20%) and a better ratio between barrel length and weapon <b>length</b> (the <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> of the EM-2 is 9.5 inches less than the U.S. M14, but its barrel is 2.5 inches longer).|$|R

5000|$|The maximum <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> is {{dictated}} {{by the need to}} fit into a box magazine of standard manufacture. For example, the [...]223 Remington cartridge, when loaded for use in the AR-15 rifle (or the military's M16 rifle), has to fit into the removable box magazine for that rifle. This dictates that the cartridge's maximum <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> be no greater than 2.260". However, for competition purposes during off-hand and slow fire prone match stages, the [...]223 Remington is loaded one cartridge at a time into the rifle's receiver. This allows for the cartridge to be longer than the standardized 2.260" [...] SAAMI maximum <b>overall</b> <b>length.</b> These cartridges can be safely loaded to a length that has the ogive portion of the bullet just touching the rifle's lands. Many competitive shooters will make these cartridges 0.005" [...] less than the truly maximum allowable <b>overall</b> <b>length,</b> for the sake of safety.|$|R
