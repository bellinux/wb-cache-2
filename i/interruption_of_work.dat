30|$|Work {{experience}} is calculated by accumulating days of full-time work for each individual. 6 We transform the variable into years of full-time work experience. The types {{of absence from}} work variables that we use are unemployment, interruptions because of maternity or parental leave for female workers (in the following referred to as maternity leave), interruptions because of military/civil service for male workers, and other non-work spells. 7 In the IABS 75 - 97, we can directly identify unemployment spells and when individuals transition from employment status with wage payment into employment status without wage payment. This is work absence because of an <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> 8 The way that we construct our sample and variables is crucial for {{the way that we}} interpret the reasons for interruptions for men and women. A challenge is that we do not directly observe childbirth, maternity leave or military/civil service as a working status in the IABS 75 - 97 data. Crucial for our approach is that we focus on young skilled highly attached workers for whom we observe complete work histories from first entry.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} {{flexibility}} on the probability of work stabilisation and on wages, by focusing on flexibility when entering the labour market and on periods of <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Our main goal is to evaluate how having entered the labour market with fixed-term contracts or having experienced periods of <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can affect the probability to stabilise and the wage level in subsequent jobs. Differently from the existing literature, we study female and male workers separately. The analysis is carried out on a dataset built up by the Istituto per lo Sviluppo della Formazione Professionale dei Lavoratori-ISFOL (Institute for the Development of Professional Training of Workers) on a sample of Italian workers. The dataset {{is representative of the}} Italian population and contains detailed information on work experience previous to the present occupation with details on types of contracts and causes of career interruptions. In {{the first part of the}} paper we examine density functions of hourly wages relative to contractual characteristics of first jobs and number of work interruptions. This part of the analysis highlights some gender differences, especially with respect to the number of spells: women are affected more than men in their hourly wages when the number of interruptions of work activity becomes too high. In the second part of the paper we estimate separate earnings functions for the sample of men and women with full-time permanent contracts. As to women, we correct for selection into full-time work by estimating a first-stage equation and including in the second-stage wage function the Mill's ratio. This correction is not necessary for men, who are very few in part-time jobs. Estimates show that flexibility affects differently men and women: the former are affected in the levels of wages while the latter in the probability to access permanent jobs. Some differences emerge also with respect to the causes of work interruptions. We explain these results in accordance with the hypothesis of the existence of a segmented labour market that sticks women in the secondary segment. On the other hand, although men are less affected by flexibility in terms of accessing the primary segment, flexibility in entrance and periods of interruption of the activity affect their human capital with negative consequences on wages...|$|E
40|$|Sewerage system (cloaca), {{which implies}} any cavity through which waste water flows, has in Roman law a special legal {{protection}} {{due to its}} importance for public health preservation and safety of citizens. In Praetorian Edict, two interdicts are envisaged; one prohibitory, by which private sewerage system is protected and one restitutory, by which public sewerage system is protected. It is possible that a restitutory interdict about private sewerage system existed. By the public sewerage interdict, a person who blocks or damages public sewerage is ordered to restore everything to previous state. By the private sewerage interdict, anyone is forbidden to obstruct a person who wants to repair sewerage that leads from his building through neighboring buildings. By lawyers' interpretations, the application of this interdict is expanded to all realty, {{as well as a}} situation of building a new sewerage system. Moreover, it is envisaged by Praetorian edict that against a person who builds or repairs sewerage neither interdict uti possidetis can be filed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} reactogenicity of three yellow fever (YF) {{vaccines}} from WHO- 17 D and Brazilian 17 DD substrains (different seed-lots) and placebo. METHODS: The study involved 1, 087 adults eligible for YF vaccine in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Vaccines produced by Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were administered ("day 0 ") following standardized procedures adapted to allow blinding and blocked randomization of participants to coded vaccine types. Adverse events after immunization were ascertained {{in an interview}} and in diary forms filled in by each participant. Liver enzymes were measured on days 0, 4 - 20 and 30 of the study. Viremia levels were measured on days 4 to 20 of follow-up. The immune response was verified through serologic tests. RESULTS: Participants were mostly young males. The seroconversion rate was above 98 % among those seronegative before immunization. Compared to placebo, the excess risk of any local adverse events ranged from 0. 9 % to 2. 5 %, whereas for any systemic adverse events it ranged from 3. 5 % to 7. 4 % across vaccine groups. The excess risk of events leading to search for medical care or to <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> activities ranged from 2 % to 4. 5 %. Viremia was detected in 3 %- 6 % of vaccinees up to 10 days after vaccination. Variations in liver enzyme levels after vaccination were similar in placebo and vaccine recipients. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of adverse events post-immunization against YF, accounting for the background occurrence of nonspecific signs and symptoms, was shown {{for the first time}} to be similar for vaccines from 17 D and 17 DD substrains.

40|$|Background Hand-arm {{vibration}} (HAV) is {{an occupational}} hazard which, cumulatively, leads to {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS). Detection and reduction of HAV can help prevent the disease or slow down its progress. Unfortunately, assessment of HAV through direct measurement is difficult due to {{the high cost of}} measurement equipment, <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> performance, and long travel cost to worksites. An alternative assessment method is through development of an exposure prediction model to identify workplace, tool, and task characteristics which significantly predict HAV exposure. Purpose The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold: 1) to determine the extent and nature of previously published scientific journal articles on exposure prediction modeling of HAV through performing a systematic review; and 2) to develop a new exposure prediction model using administrative data to find significant HAV predictors. Methods A systematic review of relevant studies involved humans aged 18 or over, applicable to occupational setting, with vibration measured using tri-axial accelerometer and statistical modeling of the effects of occupational characteristics on measure HAV were identified. Five online bibliographic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE) were searched using a combined word list of terms under three categories: “occupational diseases”; “Hand-arm vibration”; and “Statistical Modelling”. Two multiple linear regression models predicting average hand-arm vibration exposure over 8 hour day, A(8), were built using enforcement data collected by Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Saskatchewan using standard model building method. In addition, GEE was used to account for repeated data collection within workers and worksites. Results In the first manuscript, 7 articles found were deemed relevant. Four studies built regression models, while three used ANOVA to find significant HAV predictors. Examples of significant HAV predictors included: tool age, tool weight, participant, and operating power; the proportion of HAV variance explained varied from 46 to 90 %. In the second manuscript, the models based on administrative data explained 16 % to 27 % of A(8) variance. The included variables were tool power source, vibration control, and job type for the parsimonious model; the comprehensive model has the same variables as parsimonious along with accelerometer attachment method and tool brand. Conclusion HAV prediction through exposure prediction modeling is a relatively new method for assessing occupational HAV. It is feasible to find HAV predictors using low-cost administrative data, and variables such as tool power source, job type, and vibration control make promising predictors. However, the variance explained will be lower than using data collected for research purposes. The significant predictors found in the systematic review can be considered when installing protective measures in the future. The significant predictors found and procedures used from the modeling study can be considered for future HAV exposure prediction modeling studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} efficient monitoring of project costs that derives from poorly predictable construction execution, frequent <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> from the client’s side, poorly defined {{needs in the}} design phase, the uncertainty of sales and the current crisis {{in the construction industry}} dictates the development of methodology for financial analysis and control to be used during construction project execution. The developed methodology is based on technique of earned value analysis (EVA) and net present value (NPV) method. By merging these two methods, a new, improved methodology, the so-called net present earned value (NPEV), that takes into consideration the value of money over time is obtained. By using NPEV, it is possible to monitor project costs by comparing the basic real discounted cash flow (discounted to the initial term, i. e. {{to the beginning of the}} project), to the planned cash flow. The new methodology therefore includes the time component, and enables the comparison of income and expenditure amounts at different times. The proposed methodology has the potential to reduce the project risks and helps to keep costs under control.

OBJETIVO: Comparar a reatogenicidade de três vacinas contra a febre amarela (FA) das sub-cepas WHO- 17 D e 17 DD (diferentes lotes-semente), e placebo. MÉTODOS: Foram recrutados 1. 087 adultos elegíveis para vacinação contra FA no Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil. Vacinas produzidas por Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, RJ) foram administradas ("dia zero") seguindo procedimentos adaptados para alocação randômica em blocos e "cega" para o tipo de vacina. Eventos adversos pós-vacinação foram registrados em questionários e diários preenchidos pelos participantes. Enzimas hepáticas foram medidas nos dias 0, 4 - 20 e 30 do estudo. A viremia foi medida nos dias 4 - 20. A resposta imune foi verificada em testes sorológicos nos dias 0 e 30. RESULTADOS: Os participantes eram predominantemente homens jovens. A taxa de soroconversão foi superior a 98 % no grupo soronegativo antes da vacinação. Comparado ao placebo, a diferença de risco de eventos adversos locais variou de 0, 9 % a 2, 5 %, e de 3, 5 % a 7, 4 % para eventos adversos sistêmicos nos grupos vacinados. A diferença de risco desses eventos com assistência médica e/ou falta ao trabalho variou de 2, 0 % a 4, 5 %. Viremia foi detectada em 3 % a 6 % dos vacinados até 10 dias após a vacinação.

Nesta pesquisa, o suic??dio foi considerado, pelas rupturas que engendra, um evento cr??tico (DAS, 1997; MISSE et al., 2012) de grande impacto na vida dos familiares e da comunidade em geral que reflete, de certo modo, um processo social mais amplo. A pesquisa teve como objetivo compreender o processo social em que os suic??dios dos idosos ocorreram e seus efeitos na vida dos sobreviventes. O m??todo utilizado privilegiou uma abordagem qualitativa dos dados. Foram {{realizadas}} 15 aut??psias psicossociais de idosos (10 homens e cinco mulheres) que cometeram suic??dio e sete entrevistas semiestruturadas. Participaram da pesquisa, ao todo, 22 familiares (ou sobreviventes) de idosos que se suicidaram. A an??lise textual discursiva (MORAES; GALIAZZI, 2007) permitiu a emerg??ncia de categorias que foram reorganizadas a partir do conceito de homologia (WILLIAMS, 1979) e da no????o de evento cr??tico. Os resultados mostram: a) a complexa rede de fatores que interagem e se sobrep??em na produ????o do evento cr??tico que ?? o suic??dio de idosos, entre os quais est??o: a baixa escolaridade, a influ??ncia da coloniza????o alem??, a import??ncia do trabalho na vida dos agricultores, a penaliza????o do corpo pelas condi????es de trabalho no cultivo do fumo, a aus??ncia de lazer, a desvaloriza????o do idoso, a perda de sentido da vida com a interrup????o do trabalho, o medo de ser um estorvo para os familiares, a perda da sa??de e do vigor f??sico, a aus??ncia da f??, o hist??rico de agressividade, a perda financeira; b) efeitos na vida dos sobreviventes: o adoecimento ps??quico (ansiedade, ins??nia, dificuldade de retomar a vida), as pr??ticas religiosas para auxiliar o duplo da pessoa que morreu no p??s-vida, o abandono da casa ou tentativa de apagar, no ??mbito da materialidade, os vest??gios dessa morte que tem mana; c) a necessidade de Programas de Preven????o ao suic??dio e a circula????o da palavra sobre o tema. Elderly {{suicide is}} a social phenomenon {{which has become a}} major public health problem, especially in Rio Grande do Sul. In this research, due to the disruptions caused by suicide, it has been considered a critical incident (DAS, 1997; MISSE et al., 2012) of great impact {{in the lives of the}} family members and the community in general which it reflects, in a certain way, a broader social process. The goal of this research was to understand the social process in which the suicide of elderly people took place and the effects of these critical incidents on the lives of the survivors. The research method focused on a qualitative approach to data. We performed 15 psychosocial autopsies of elderly people (10 men and five women) who committed suicide, and seven semi-structured interviews. Altogether, twenty-two family members (or survivors) took part in this research. The discursive textual analysis (MORAES; GALIAZZI, 2007) allowed the emergence of some categories which were reorganized based on the concept of homology (WILLIAMS, 1979) and the notion of critical incident. The results showed: a) the complex network of factors which interact and overlap, leading up to this critical incident (elderly suicide), some of them being: a low level of education, the influence from German colonization, the importance of work in the lives of farmers, the body injuries caused by the working conditions of tobacco cultivation, the lack of leisure time, the devaluation of the elderly, the loss of meaning in life due to <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> the fear of being a hindrance for the family, the health loss and reduced physical energy, the lack of faith, a history of aggressiveness, a financial loss; b) the effects on the lives of suicide survivors: mental disorders (anxiety, insomnia, difficulty to resume normal life), religious practices to help the deceased's double in their afterlives, house abandonment or attempt to remove, materially, traces of the death, which has mana; c) the necessity of creating suicide Prevention Programs and spreading the word on the subject...|$|E

Diversos preceptes d’aquesta llei estan dirigits a la tutela de la salut de la dona treballadora preveuen la suspensió del contracte en un termini de 4 a 6 setmanes posteriors al part i la interrupció del treball per la dona amb fills lactants una hora al dia dins de les del treball per tal d'alletar els seus fills. Una altra norma protectora de la salut de la dona és la llei de la Cadira (de 1912) que ordena als establiments no fabrils que la dona pugui utilitzar un seient sempre i qual li permeti desenvolupar la seva feina. La llei d' 11 de juliol de 1912 prohibeix el treball industrial nocturn de les dones en tallers i fàbriques completant l'incipient sistema de la salut física de la treballadora. El desenvolupament de les normes laborals destinades a la protecció de la dona treballadora no sempre és ben acceptada per aquest col·lectiu que no dubta en protagonitzar diferents actes de rebuig a una legislació que teòricament les afavoria. El tracte igualitari a l'àmbit laboral s'apunta amb la legislació de la Segona República que patirà un retrocés significatiu durant la Dictadura Franquista. Per tal de desenvolupar el contingut de l’assignatura en els termes descrits, s’ha pensat en la realització d’una sèrie de competències que s’han de tenir en compte, i que es presenten en dos quadres descriptors; un que contempla les competències de cura i provisió en el programa docent i un altre centrat en les activitats planificades al voltant de la dinàmica a l’aula, la dinàmica de tutories i l’avaluació. The subject entitled Social and Political Contemporary History, {{which is}} taught as a core {{subject in the}} framework of the Degree in Industrial Relations, has its focus in the historic perspective of social legislation. In this sense, one of the main references is the well-known “half workforce”, that is to say, working girls and boys and women, and the corresponding regulatory provisions that seek to ensure both physical and moral health for women. A first example is the law dated 13 March 1900, issued by the Silvela Government, which offers a set of protective measures relating to the health of young workers. Several rules of this law are targeted to the protection of the health of working women and foresee the suspension of the employment contract in a deadline of 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth and the <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for women with breast-fed babies one hour per day during working hours in order to breast-feed their children. Another rule protecting women’s health is the so-called law of the Chair (dated 1912) which obliges nonindustrial establishments to allow women to have a seat while working as long as this does not hinder the development of their work. The law of 11 July 1912 forbids industrial night work to women working in factories and plants, complementing in this way the emerging physical health system of working women. The development of labour standards targeted to the protection of working women is not always well accepted by this group who plays the lead in different acts refusing a legislation which theoretically favoured them. Equal treatment in the context of labour goes together with the legislation of the Second Republic which will suffer a major recession during Franco’s dictatorship. In order to develop the contents of the subject as described above, a series of abilities have been taken into account. These abilities are presented in two descriptive tables: one considers the abilities for the provision in the curricula and the other one is focused in the activities planned in relation to the dynamics of the classroom, the dynamics of tutorials and the evaluation...|$|E
50|$|For the {{erection}} of {{a memorial}} in Gallipoli, an architectural contest was opened in 1944. The design by architects Doğan Erginbaş, Ismail Utkular and civil engineer Ertuğrul Barla won the official contest. Construction {{of the monument}} was decided in 1952, and the ground stone was laid on 19 April 1954. Financial problems caused <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the construction <b>works</b> several times. The main structure was completed on 15 March 1958. In the meantime, the Turkish daily Milliyet started a countrywide financial support campaign, and the memorial was officially opened on 21 August 1960.|$|R
50|$|The Parliament House (today Old Parliament Building, {{housing the}} National Historical Museum), {{which was to}} house the {{assemblies}} of Parliament and of the Senate. It was founded in 1858 and construction started upon the plans of the French architect François/Florimond Boulanger. After the expulsion of King Otto (1862) and {{the implementation of the}} Constitution of 1864, the Senate was abolished. After an <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the building <b>works,</b> the plans were modified by Panagis Kalkos. The main change in these plans was the abolishment of the Senate assembly hall. The building was thus completed in 1871.|$|R
40|$|Background. During {{medication}} administration process, including preparation, administration, and documentation, {{there is}} high proportion <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> {{that results in}} medication administration errors that consequently affect the safety of patients. Thus, {{the main purpose of}} this study was to assess the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> and associated factors during medication administration process. Methods. A prospective, observation-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 278 nurses. Structure observational sheet was utilized to collect data. EPI Info version 3. 5. 3 and SPSS version 20 software were utilized for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary and multivariable logistic regression were fitted to identify the associated factors using an odds ratio and 95 % CI. Results. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was found to be 1, 152 during medication administration process. Of this, 579 (50. 3 %) were major/severe <b>work</b> <b>interruptions.</b> Unit <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> day <b>of</b> the week, professional experience, perceived severity <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruption,</b> source/initiator <b>of</b> <b>interruption,</b> and secondary tasks were factors significantly associated with major work interruptions at p< 0. 05. Conclusion. In this study, more than half <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was major/severe. Thus, the authors suggest raising the awareness of nurses regarding the severity <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>interruptions,</b> with special attention to those who have lower <b>work</b> experience, sources <b>of</b> <b>interruption,</b> and secondary tasks by assigning additional nurses who manage secondary tasks and supportive supervision...|$|R
