5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that {{something}} bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
500|$|William Hurt was {{initially}} offered {{the role of}} Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script. Harrison Ford was also offered the role of Grant. Sam Neill was ultimately cast as Grant {{three or four weeks}} before filming began. Neill said that [...] "it all happened real quick. I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, and {{in a matter of weeks}} I'm working with Spielberg." [...] Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role. According to Hirshenson, Carrey [...] "was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposed to be," [...] Granet {{answered}} grimly. [...] "I am {{beginning to}} wonder--Tell me, you haven't <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> him, have you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I, Dave. I {{never did}} like that fellow, and I don't like his father, either. By the way, have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> the farm {{that belongs to}} Professor Potts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't blame you." [...] Ben Russell paused. [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> Braxton Bogg {{and that}} hundred and forty {{thousand}} dollars {{he said he}} had left hidden in Benedicto Lupez's house in Manila?" ...|$|R
500|$|Approximately {{two minutes}} after departing for the chart room, Captain Brown reemerged {{on the open}} bridge and reassumed the conn of the battleship. He summoned Lieutenants Hatfield and Arnold, Missouris morning and forenoon {{officers}} of the watch, respectively, and informed them of the planned run through the acoustical range. As with Commander Peckham, {{this was the first}} time that either of these two men had <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the planned acoustical test run. When Captain Brown noted their confused looks, he promptly informed the men to [...] "Go get yourselves informed", at which point both officers reported to the chart room on level eight. There they learned of the impending run through the acoustical range by looking at the chart with the buoys marking the range; despite this, both remained confused over aspects of the planned run.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men {{under the command of}} Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the {{surrounding}} country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback. [...] This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. [...] The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. [...] A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> when the regulars are coming out?" [...] upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29th, 2017, X-Pac was {{reported}} to have missed a flight to the United Kingdom for International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. IPW:UK stated that they were [...] "working on the expectation X-Pac will not be making tomorrow's event", and had [...] "not <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him" [...] and that they [...] "wish(ed) Sean well".|$|E
6000|$|... "River pirates, Hiram? I {{have not}} <b>heard</b> you say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> them before. I {{did not know}} there were any pirates on these rivers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to do? You tell me, and I can't {{altogether}} hold my tongue." [...] Then {{there was}} a pause. [...] "Well, my dear, as for my consent, of course you may have it,--if it's worth anything. I don't know that I ever <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> bad <b>about</b> Captain Aylmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{the only}} one who is not afraid of the pirates,' Slightly said, in the tone that {{prevented}} his being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, 'but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> Cinderella.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Tharrington {{assured that}} there was/is no kissing ban on Luke and Noah, {{although}} {{she would not}} say {{what would happen in}} future shows. She described the mistletoe shot as a [...] "creative decision". [...] "It's always hard to please a diverse audience," [...] Tharrington added, [...] "and we have a diverse audience." [...] One fan had recalled reading a handful of letters in soap opera publications after Luke and Noah's first kiss along the lines of [...] "I don't care if Luke is gay, but I don't want to see it." [...] Bloom stated that there was a [...] "minimal" [...] negative reaction from viewers about the storyline. Despite this, she could not clarify what [...] "minimal" [...] meant in this case. There had been no organized campaign by conservative or parent advocacy groups that monitor television content. [...] "It's entirely new to me," [...] said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council. [...] "I hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} days, while at {{work with the}} other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{started out}} his {{season with a}} {{promising}} race in the Daytona 500. He led 40 laps in the waning stages in the race. He took the white flag to start the final lap, but was passed by teammate Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex, Jr.. Kenseth's attempt at blocking backfired as he went sideways and lost several positions. Kenseth finished 14th while Hamlin edged Truex to the stripe to win the closest finish in the race's history. One week later in the Atlanta race, he was tagged for [...] "improper fueling" [...] during a green flag pit stop {{and was forced to}} serve a pass-through penalty. He was given the black flag with the white cross marks for not pitting within three laps. After serving that penalty, he ended up in 31st two-laps down. After the race, he said [...] "I got black-flagged for some type of pit road penalty and I didn’t know it and pitted the lap they told me to do a pass through – I'm assuming they were black flagging us before that and they pulled our card. I never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it or at least saw the flag or anything, so I came when they told me to come and I guess they must have penalized us a couple laps or something. I don’t really know. I haven’t really seen it.” However, Kenseth did go on to finish 19th. He finished 37th at Las Vegas after being involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards late in the race.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was he, poor fellow?" [...] Guy murmured, with a {{sympathetic}} face; for Cyril had always alluded casually to his fellow-traveller in such general terms that Guy was as yet unaware {{there was a}} lady in the case. [...] "And is he all right again now, do you know? Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} can walk to the door with me," [...] said the girl hesitatingly, but with a certain pleased flutter. [...] "Still I never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> extra good <b>about</b> Wall Street brokers, or sports who go to prize fights, either. Ain't you got any other recommendations?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} a {{schooner}} hove to off a Japanese fishing village, sent ashore four sailors {{and a little}} midshipman, and sailed away. These men did not talk English, but they had money and quickly {{made their way to}} Yokohama. From that day the Japanese village folk never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> them, and they are still a much-talked-of mystery. As the Russian government never said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the incident, the United States is still ignorant of the whereabouts of the lost poacher, nor has she ever heard, officially, {{of the way in which}} some of her citizens [...] "shanghaied" [...] five subjects of the tsar. Even nations have secrets sometimes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it?' {{continued}} Mr. Cassilis. 'Young Coningsby {{brought it}} from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?' ...|$|E

6000|$|He asked, with {{a certain}} slyness, [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her already? At the club? From that fool woman in the kitchen?" ...|$|E
40|$|A {{dinner with}} Correa, [Robert] Brown, [Charles] Konig, and Hare; Mr Forster thinks Correa's mental powers are failing. Correa's opinion of America. Walked to [Stoke] Newington and visited the Aikins, Mrs Barbauld, Mrs Lee, and Revd Mr Bransby. Unable to see [Nathaniel] Kinderley [Smith's cousin] {{before he goes}} to India.

6000|$|... "No. They had a niece once, though. They {{brought her}} up and they just worshipped her. She ran away with a {{worthless}} fellow--I forget his name, if I ever knew it. He was handsome and smooth-tongued, {{but he was a}} scamp. She died soon after and it just broke their hearts. They don't even know where she was buried, and they never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> her husband. I've heard that Aunt Flora's hair turned snow-white in a month. I'll take you up to see her some day when I find time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I've ever <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> very exact <b>about</b> the thing at all," [...] he said. [...] "The whole subject is hateful to me. I regard {{marriage}} as sacred, and when, which God forbid, it proves unsacred, it is horrible {{to think of}} these formalities. This is a Christian country; we are all flesh and blood. What is this slime, Paramor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just thought}} I'd {{ask you if}} you had <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> that Blackie Crowden yet," [...] remarked the {{gardener}} from Hope, as he approached.|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't say a word. She {{never has}} said a word. As {{far as that}} goes she might never have <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{the line}} from Ipswich to Norwich, sir," [...] he replied, [...] "but we can't very well change our course without {{definite}} instructions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{got back}} to Lerida we took two or three of the stones to a jeweler and found that they were all right. Then we divided the swag into three parts as we had agreed. Thompson took one, I took another, and the other was divided among the four troopers, who were not running such a risk as we were. I never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> the matter, as far as I was concerned, though there was a row. The prior heard that Peterborough had never been near Lerida, and came over and saw General Wyndham.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, ma'am,' {{continued}} Bounderby, 'I {{have not}} <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> it. It's in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at present - something new for him; he hadn't the schooling I had - is helping. My injunction is, Keep it quiet, {{and let it}} seem to blow over. Do what you like under the rose, but don't give a sign of what you're about; or half a hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted, {{out of reach for}} good. Keep it quiet, and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have 'em.' ...|$|R
50|$|While confessing to {{the murder}} of Betty Wilson, Marquette also confessed to another murder in the same style in 1974. He picked up a woman at a bar, {{convinced}} her to come to his home, and proceeded to choke her to death and mutilate and dismember her corpse. Marquette led detectives to two shallow graves where he had disposed of the bulk of the remains, but the head was never located and as the remains were mostly skeletal, there was no way the woman could be identified. Marquette said that he didn't know her name and since he never <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> it, he figured that nobody missed her. Her identity remains unknown.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, father, I {{have not}} <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. I {{came out here}} {{directly}} I finished my breakfast. How {{are the people who}} were brought up here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I shall not. There will {{be people}} there whom I don't know, and I don't want to know. Have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> him, Mrs. Finn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, Lane," [...] {{he asked}} curiously, [...] "have you <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{any of the}} victims of our little {{struggle}} last night--I mean the two men we tackled?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{the only}} man I've ever <b>heard</b> say <b>anything</b> good <b>about</b> any one in the land business, {{and it does not}} amount to much at that," [...] he said. [...] "Devine has been {{successful}} so far, but even gentlemen of his talents are liable to make a mistake occasionally, and if ever he makes a big one, it will probably go hardly with him. That, at least, is one consolation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} <b>heard</b> them say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. I shall be sorry when they go, {{for they are}} both pleasant, {{and it makes it}} very much more {{agreeable}} for the girls to have them to go about with. Of course, when we take the carriage we all ride together, but I am sure the young people enjoy walking much more; they are capital climbers, and I can tell you they pretty nearly tire me out sometimes.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{two things}} {{encouraged}} and invigorated her: he was alive, {{and he had}} written to her. That was everything, and she would banish all speculations and fears until she had read his letter, and, until she had read it, she must keep the matter a secret--she must not let anybody imagine that she had <b>heard</b> <b>anything,</b> or was <b>about</b> to hear <b>anything.</b> By good fortune, she had five thousand francs in hand, and, with these in her pocket-book, she ordered her carriage {{half an hour before}} the time appointed.|$|R
