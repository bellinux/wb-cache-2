40|$|Beekeeping’s {{popularity}} has surged in recent years, perhaps {{culminating in the}} introduction of the first ever White <b>House</b> <b>bee</b> hive. Local Apiaries provide a wide variety of benefits to communities, ranging from pollination services for gardens to producing honey {{that can be used in}} a wide array of foods and products. Apiaries are not always welcome in a community, however, perhaps because of their potential to cause a nuisance, or to harm crops or people. Although beekeeping regulation implicates both state and federal concerns a number of localities have developed unique and practical regulations that promote backyard beekeeping, while maximizing its benefits and minimizing its potential harm. This article examines those regulations with the hope of aiding land use regulators in developing strategies to promote beekeeping activities...|$|E

40|$|This thesis defined {{historic}} apiary typologies {{and technologies}} including: <b>bee</b> <b>houses</b> and honey <b>houses,</b> <b>bee</b> shelters, stands, and hives. Because {{of a strong}} beekeeping tradition in Philadelphia and its influential role in the advancement of apiculture, this paper researched apiary typologies beginning in Philadelphia and its region. The Rev. L. L. Langstroth, a Philadelphian, experimented with beekeeping methods and technologies, inventing the moveable-frame hive in 1851, which would later make the <b>bee</b> <b>house</b> {{and other forms of}} protection unnecessary. Bee manual authors provided various structural forms to protect the hives, produce valuable honey, and aid the beekeeping process. These vernacular structures were either decorative and playful as an architectural folly in the landscape, or simply utilitarian and unadorned. A <b>bee</b> <b>house</b> and honey house remain intact in Madison, Indiana and stand as rare tangible evidence of the type. Other regions developed their own typologies, but common themes emerged. The typological defining features are; protecting the beehive from weather and temperature fluctuations, providing ample forage, utilizing trees as wind breaks, and locating the apiary near a frequented dwelling. This thesis reveals a once common but now obscure outbuilding type that has largely disappeared from the American cultural landscape and rescued the <b>bee</b> <b>house</b> form from near total obscurity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Physical {{factors of}} {{refractive}} index, optical density, viscosity and surface tension demonstrated quantitative change throughout five stages of honey ripening process in indigenous hive honeybee Apis cerana indica. The five stages of nectar to honey transformations include floral nectar (fn), honey crop of foragers (hf), honey crop of <b>house</b> <b>bees</b> (hh), unsealed honey cells (uh) and sealed honey cells (sh). All the four physical factors gradually augmented through successive stages of honey ripening phenomena. The refractive index of floral nectaries and sealed honey cells was 1. 23 and 1. 49 respectively. Similarly, the optical density of <b>house</b> <b>bees</b> and unsealed honey cells was 0. 39 and 0. 54 respectively. Viscosity and surface tension of honey crop of foragers and sealed honey cells were 0. 15 poise, 0. 76 dynes/cms. and 76. 65 poise, 102. 01 dynes/cms. respectively. The {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) of viscosity and surface tension in honey formation was significant at P< 0. 01 % levels and refractive index and optical density of honey in ripening process was not significant at P< 0. 01 % levels Key words: Apis cerana indica, honey ripening, physical factors...|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a bee skep was to <b>house</b> <b>bees</b> so that wax and honey could be obtained. The bees were often kept in gardens or {{orchards}} where there were flowers providing nectar and pollen. A further benefit was that the bees pollinated the flowers, although this was not discovered until 1750.

40|$|Honeybees, Apis mellifera, show age-related {{division}} of labor in which young adults perform maintenance ("housekeeping") tasks inside the colony before switching to outside foraging at approximately 23 days old. Disease resistance is an important feature of honeybee biology, but {{little is known about}} the interaction of pathogens and age-related {{division of}} labor. We tested a hypothesis that older forager bees and younger "house" bees differ in susceptibility to infection. We coupled an infection bioassay with a functional analysis of gene expression in individual bees using a whole genome microarray. Forager bees treated with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae s. l. survived for significantly longer than <b>house</b> <b>bees.</b> This was concomitant with substantial differences in gene expression including genes associated with immune function. In <b>house</b> <b>bees,</b> infection was associated with differential expression of 35 candidate immune genes contrasted with differential expression of only two candidate immune genes in forager bees. For control bees (i. e. not treated with M. anisopliae) the development from the house to the forager stage was associated with differential expression of 49 candidate immune genes, including up-regulation of the antimicrobial peptide gene abaecin, plus major components of the Toll pathway, serine proteases, and serpins. We infer that reduced pathogen susceptibility in forager bees was associated with age-related activation of specific immune system pathways. Our findings contrast with the view that the immunocompetence in social insects declines with the onset of foraging as a result of a trade-off in the allocation of resources for foraging. The up-regulation of immune-related genes in young adult bees in response to M. anisopliae infection was an indicator of disease susceptibility; this also challenges previous research in social insects, in which an elevated immune status has been used as a marker of increased disease resistance and fitness without considering the effects of age-related development...|$|R

50|$|The Pearson-Arastradero Preserve {{is unusual}} in its {{intensive}} ecological restoration program where Acterra, a Palo Alto-based environmental group, acts as a steward for the preserve and engages community volunteers in programs that combine habitat restoration with environmental education and accommodate {{a wide range of}} volunteers from high schools to local corporations. Their projects focus primarily on removing yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Medusahead grass (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus), wild mustard and teasel and replacing these invasives with native species. In 2006, Acterra conducted a large-scale creek daylighting project and continues to work on creek stabilization, sediment harvesting and planting riparian species. Reforestation projects focus on native oaks, including planting and caging young native oaks, and removal of high fire-danger eucalyptus. To encourage and support a greater diversity of fauna, Acterra volunteers install nesting boxes, bird perches, raptor poles, bat <b>houses,</b> <b>bee</b> blocks and brush piles. The Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society maintains and places bird houses and co-leads bird hikes with Acterra.
