5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E
5|$|I beseech you, Holy Spirit of the Father and Son: {{for when}} the holy throng re-echoes its songs, may I then with humble voice be able to ascend quickly as I leave the grave, bearing then the holy prayers of the saints who already have scorned this present world of <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> their learned outpourings, and may I fearlessly be able to pour out my glorious song to the triune (God).|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are ochreous, thickly <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> grey. The lines are very obscure. The hindwings are white, <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> sandy-grey along the inner margin.|$|R

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbinical literature {{argues that}} Judah reacted violently {{to the threat}} against Benjamin, shouting so loudly that Hushim, who was then in Canaan, was able to hear Judah ask him to travel to Egypt, to help Judah destroy it; some sources have Judah angrily picking up an extremely heavy stone (400 shekels in weight), throwing it into the air, then grinding it to <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> his feet once it had landed. These rabbinical sources argue that Judah had Naphtali enumerate the districts of Egypt, and after finding out that there were 12 (historically, there were actually 20 in Lower Egypt and 22 in Upper Egypt), he decided to destroy three himself, and have his brothers destroy one of the remaining districts each; the threat of destroying Egypt was, according to these sources, what really motivated Joseph to reveal himself to his brothers.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} are red-brown or maroon colour, sparsely <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> dark-brown on the disc, but densely so {{along the}} margins, {{especially in the}} apical part of the wing, where brown is the prevailing hue and is <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> white.

50|$|The {{antennae}} {{are light}} fuscous with indistinct darker annulations. The labial palpi are white, <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> black.

The forewings are bluish silvery white, densely overlaid {{with black and}} brown in ill-defined wavy transverse lines. Each white scale is tipped with black. The apical part of the wing is strongly cupreous brown, especially around the edge. The hindwings are light fuscous, the abdomen is silvery fuscous and the legs are white <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 31 mm. The forewings are whitish ochreous, slightly suffused with fuscous grey and dark fuscous markings.

The extreme base is white, {{separated by a}} transverse oblique dark fuscous line.|$|R
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable {{and he was very}} disappointed when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red <b>Dust,</b> <b>with</b> Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was young enough to be his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E

This quote is often given in Latin as [...] "Noli turbare circulos meos," [...] but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch. Valerius Maximus, writing in Memorable Doings and Sayings in the 1st century AD, gives the phrase as [...] "...sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare" [...] - [...] "... but protecting the <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this.

[...] Concerning Augustine's De Trinitate (On the Trinity), White wrote that Augustine [...] "...develops at length the view that in the creation of living beings there was something like a growth—that God is the ultimate author, but works through secondary causes; and finally argues that certain substances are endowed by God with the power of producing certain classes of plants and animals." ...|$|E

As the chorus of the song starts, Kesha and her friends start to run around the motel dancing and jumping off railings. The friends gather around an empty pool and start tearing at each other's clothing; While this is happening it is revealed they that are on a different planet and Kesha is seen rolling around in sand. Slowly {{as some of the}} friends start taking off their clothing, they begin to turn into star dust. The group starts to dance in the pool with some of the party goers exploding into dust. The remainder of the friends continue to dance in the dust that is now covering the bottom of the pool. As this is happening they all begin to lose different parts of their bodies as they explode into multicolored star dust. The video ends with everyone as <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> Kesha beginning to [...] "unzip" [...] herself as she turns into yellow dust.|$|E

500|$|The optical {{properties}} of the halo ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it comprises only <b>dust</b> <b>with</b> particle sizes less than 15μm. Parts of the halo located far from the ring plane may consist of submicrometre dust. This dusty composition explains the much stronger forward-scattering, bluer colors and lack of visible structure in the halo. The dust probably originates in the main ring, a claim supported by the fact that the halo’s optical depth [...] is comparable with that of the dust in the main ring. The large thickness of the halo can be attributed to the excitation of orbital inclinations and eccentricities of dust particles by the electromagnetic forces in the Jovian magnetosphere. The outer boundary of the halo ring coincides with location of a strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance. As Poynting–Robertson drag causes particles to slowly drift towards Jupiter, their orbital inclinations are excited while passing through it. The bloom of the main ring may be a beginning of the halo. The halo ring’s inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance. In this resonance the excitation is probably very significant, forcing particles to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere thus defining a sharp inner boundary. Being derived from the main ring, the halo has the same age.|$|E
