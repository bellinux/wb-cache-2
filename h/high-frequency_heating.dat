40|$|This paper {{describes}} a time-discontinuous Galerkin {{finite element method}} (DGFEM-βc) for the generalised thermoelastic problem of multilayer materials subjected to a transient <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heat</b> source. The governing and constitutive relations are presented {{on the basis of}} the well-known Lord–Shulman (L–S) theory. A DGFEM-βc method is developed to allow the general temperature-displacement vector and its temporal gradient to be discontinuous at a fixed time t. A stiffness proportional artificial damping term is added to the final DG discretisation form to filter out the spurious numerical oscillations in the wave-after stage and at adjacent-layer interfaces. The numerical results show that the present DGFEM-βc provides much more accurate solutions for generalised thermoelastic coupled behaviour of multilayer structures. Compared with widely used traditional numerical methods (e. g., the Newmark method), the present DGFEM-βc can effectively capture the discontinuities behaviours of impulsive waves in space in the simulation of high modes and sharp gradients...|$|R
40|$|Using {{continuous}} approximation {{we study}} the static and <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heat</b> dissipation in multi-layer graphene on a ferroelectric. We {{demonstrate that the}} Joule heating effect, caused by a high-frequency ac electric current in graphene, creates a pronounced temperature gradient in a ferroelectric substrate. The pyroelectric effect transforms the gradient into the spontaneous polarization gradient [...] Therefore, the high-frequency depolarizing electric field occurs and penetrates in the multi-layer graphene. Free charges in graphene immediately screen the electric field and thus their density oscillates at high-frequency. Performed calculations had proved that the pyroelectric effect can modify essentially the free carrier density at the graphene-ferroelectric interface and consequently the conductivity of multi-layer graphene channel. So, pyroelectric mechanism can be critical for understanding of the complex physical thermal and electrical processes taking place across and along graphene-ferroelectric interfaces at terahertz frequencies.

40|$|Modulated <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> of the D region {{ionosphere}} {{near the}} auroral electrojet can generate {{extremely low frequency}} (ELF; 3 Hz- 3 kHz) radio waves. The modulated heating process is nonlinear and generates harmonics at integer multiples of the ELF modulation frequency. Quaternary phase shift keying, a digital modulation technique is applied to ELF waves to demonstrate transmission of digital data. Data were successfully decoded at a nearby receiver and the bit error rate computed. Square wave modulation of the high-frequency heater results in stronger signals and hence a smaller bit error rate. Simulations of the communication system using ELF waveforms and noise signals derived from ELF observations are also conducted. These simulations show that using higher harmonics of the ELF signal to improve the signal-to-noise ratio can reduce the bit error rate, although only when these harmonics are below similar to 4. 5 kHz because of radio atmospherics (sferics) generating strong impulsive noise at higher frequencies.

40|$|The forcing of {{equatorial}} waves by convective heating in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model (CCM 3) is {{investigated and}} {{compared with the}} forcing deduced from observations of convective clouds. The analysis is performed on two different simulations, wherein convection {{is represented by the}} Zhang–McFarlane and the Hack parameterization schemes, respectively. Spectra of equatorial waves excited by convective heating (Rossby, Kelvin, and gravity waves) are obtained by projecting the heating field onto Hough modes; the dynamical response to the heating is then calculated in terms of the vertical component of the Eliassen–Palm flux, Fz, focusing on waves that are able to propagate into the middle atmosphere. The same analysis is repeated using observations of outgoing longwave radiation as a proxy for tropical convection. Comparison of CCM 3 results with those derived from observations indicates that <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> var-iability is underestimated in both CCM 3 simulations, despite the fact that time-mean values of convective heating are well represented. Moreover, the two convective parameterization schemes differ substantially from each other: Compared to observations, Fz is severely underestimated at most frequencies when CCM 3 is run with the Zhang–McFarlane scheme. When the Hack scheme is used, Fz at frequencies |v |, 0. 5 cycles per day is comparable to the observations, but it is underestimated at higher frequencies. Misrepresentation of the variability of convective heating is likely to have important consequences for the dynamical simulation of the middle atmosphere and even the troposphere. 1...|$|E

40|$|To obtain bulky large-sized {{orthoferrite}} single crystals {{with different}} rare-earth elements a new crystal growth technology is proposed including modified Czochralski method and using no metal crucibles for melt suspension. For this purpose two unusual Czochralski method modifications are used.

In the last case the melt volume is considerably larger and this circumstance allows to obtain large-sized single crystals.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of high temperature emission {{in the core}} of a solar active region using instruments on Hinode and SDO. These multi-instrument observations allow us to determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the apex of the high temperature loops the emission measure distribution is strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0. 5 MK is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We also find that the temporal evolution in broad-band soft X-ray images is relatively constant over about 6 hours of observing. Observations in the cooler SDO/AIA bandpasses generally do not show cooling loops {{in the core of}} the active region, consistent with the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations suggest that the high temperature loops observed in the core of an active region are close to equilibrium. We find {{that it is possible to}} reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines with a simple, <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> scenario where heating events occur on time scales much less than a cooling time. In contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines and predict low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too large.

40|$|E ARLIER {{investigations}} 1 ' 2 with mammal-ian {{heart muscle}} {{have shown that}} the resting potential drops only slightly when the temperature is lowered from 37 to 20 C, but decreases considerably upon further cooling. Coraboeuf and Weidmann 2 suggested 3 pos-sible explanations for the depolarization in the cold: (1) a rise of the Na permeability relative to the K and Cl permeabilities of the fiber membrane; (2) failure of active potas-sium reabsorption leading to a rise of the K concentration in the interspace; and (3) lowering of Na extrusion from the cells. Three groups of experiments were carried out in an attempt to test these hypotheses: (1) influence of Na-laek on temperature sensitivity; (2) rapid <b>high-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> of cooled fibers, to look for a possible time lag between the rise of temperature and the rise of potential; and (3) influence of metabolic inhibitors on tem-perature sensitivity.
