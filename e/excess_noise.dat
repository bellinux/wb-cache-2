[...] As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. [...] One of the better gadgets was a motor scooter that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir Henry Norman. Despite his best efforts, business wasn't his strong point. [...] An example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend Lord Brabazon and others. [...] It was entitled Armchair Science, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold off. [...] Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. [...] He was a regular attendee at Brooklands and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. [...] An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. [...] One of Low's peeves was <b>excess</b> <b>noise,</b> to this end he invented an audiometer to measure and record noise in a visual form. [...] He conducted experiments on the London Underground and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels. In 1938 Low had lunch with a gentleman called William Joyce. [...] Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run.

40|$|Abstract We report voltage {{noise studies}} in the superconducting {{transition}} of thin Tin (Sn) films. Voltage noises are measured {{as a function of}} temperature and ac cur-rent. The noise spectral power S 1 / 2 strongly depends on the temperature and current, with the peak temperature in S 1 / 2 shifted down from that of dR/dT. Comparison with the dc noise measurement shows the S 1 / 2 is much larger with ac current than dc. I–V characteristics and voltage noises are measured simultaneously to reveal the nature of the <b>excess</b> <b>noises.</b> The noise dependence on voltage strongly suggests the nature of vortex shot noise with a characteristic V dependence for small V and reduction of S 1 / 2 due to strong correlation of vortices at large V...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{demodulation}} of ultra-short light pulses with photodetectors {{is accompanied}} by <b>excess</b> phase <b>noise</b> at the pulse repetition rate and harmonics in the spectrum of the photocurrent. The major contribution to this noise is power fluctuations of the detected pulse train that, if not compensated for, can seriously limit the stability of fre-quency transfer from optical to microwave domain. By making use of an infrared femtosecond laser, we mea-sured the spectral density of the <b>excess</b> phase <b>noise,</b> as well as power-to-phase conversion for different types of InGaAs photodetectors. Noise measurements were performed with a novel type of dual-channel readout system using a fiber coupled beam splitter. Strong suppression of the <b>excess</b> phase <b>noise</b> was observed in both channels of the measure-ment system when the average power of the femtosecond pulse train was stabilized.
