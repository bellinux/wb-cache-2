[...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

6000|$|But what do <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that?</b> That {{ought to}} depend on what Moses meant by it. Moses meant what God meant, and unless I mean the same thing I must mean {{something}} wrong. And this is what I think it does mean: ...|$|E
60|$|I GOT your nice long gossiping letter to-day - <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> {{that there}} was more news in it than usual - and so, of course, I am pretty jolly. I am in the house, however, with such a beastly cold in the head. Our east winds begin already to be very cold.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an {{odd thing}} {{to say to a}} young lady," [...] he continued. [...] "But have you any idea what--what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that?</b> No, of course not. I don't use the word in a {{conventional}} sense. I use it as young men use it. Girls are kept very ignorant, aren't they? Perhaps it's wise--perhaps--You don't know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was waiting}} for you," [...] said she. [...] "I {{wanted to see how}} that hat fitted, and I think it does nicely. And I wanted to tell you that I have been looking out for ships, but have not seen one. <b>I</b> don't <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want you to go away almost as soon as you have come, but of course, if a {{merchant}} ship should anchor here, it would be dreadful for you not to know." ...|$|R
40|$|Power and {{especially}} the power to influence human beings, power to unite persons within an organization and society cannot be ignored because of the important role it plays. It is a capacity {{that can be used}} to make or destroy human life, society and well being. In order to understand power, it is necessary to know the agents of power, how they wield it and for what object. In our modern environment the agents of power face a changing society that is more Democratic. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> democracy <b>that</b> “at the heart of the democratic ideal lies the notion of equal freedom for all to deliberate the aims of society”...|$|R
6000|$|... 107. Next, {{examine the}} {{technical}} {{treatment of the}} pig, above. I have purposely chosen this {{as an example of}} a white object on dark ground, and the frog as a dark object on light ground, to explain to you what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> saying <b>that</b> fine engraving regards local color, but not light and shade. You see both frog and pig are absolutely without light and shade. The frog, indeed, casts a shadow; but his hind leg is as white as his throat. In the pig you don't even know which way the light falls. But you know at once that the pig is white, and the frog brown or green.|$|R
6000|$|... 157. (C) [...] "What do {{you mean}} by usury?" [...] What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> word, my Lord, is surely of no {{consequence}} to anyone but my few readers, and fewer disciples. What David and his Son meant by it I have prayed your Lordship to tell your flock, {{in the name of the}} Church which dictates daily to them the songs of the one, and professes to interpret to them the commands of the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "On my return, {{he asked}} me how she was, and I answered, half in a dream, 'Oh, bonny, she's trying to read a little,' and he raised himself on his elbow and called out to her, and for answer there came back silence--not the silence that is silence, but the silence that is as a voice. I {{do not know if}} you {{understand}} what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> If you had lived among the dead as long as I have, you would know.|$|E
6000|$|Again, says {{a man to}} himself: [...] "I have a fair {{right to}} believe that mankind {{are not the only}} persons in the universe--that there are other beings beside God whom I cannot see. I call them angels. I hardly know what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> The really {{important}} question about them to me is: Will they do me harm? Can they do me good? Are they stronger than I?--Ought I not to fear them, to try to please them, to keep them favourable to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; nothing even hinted at, Mr. Mason,--as you justly observe. <b>That</b> is what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> saying <b>that</b> Round and Crook's people didn't get {{up their}} little facts. Believe me, sir, {{there are men}} in the {{profession}} out of London who know quite as much as Round and Crook. They ought to have had those facts, seeing that the very copy of the document was turned over by their hands." [...] And Mr. Dockwrath hit the table heavily {{in the warmth of}} his indignation against his professional brethren. Earlier in the interview Mr. Mason would have been made very angry by such freedom, but he was not angry now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something characteristic," [...] eh? [...] Humph! <b>I</b> reckon you <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> [...] Something that {{happened}} in our way, [...] Here at the crossin' of Big Pine Flat. [...] Times aren't now {{as they used to}} be, [...] When gold was flush and the boys were frisky, [...] And a man would pull out his battery [...] For anything--maybe the price of whiskey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you have}} {{actually}} more strength than a bird,--a robin, for instance; you could hold {{him so that}} he could not get away; and you could lift more than he could too. But then you are a great deal larger, and you are not as much stronger than he is, as you are larger. If you are a hundred times as heavy as he, you are not a hundred times as strong. <b>That's</b> what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> saying <b>that</b> you are absolutely stronger, but not relatively. That is, you are not as many times stronger, as you are larger and heavier. You are absolutely stronger, but not relatively; that is, in proportion to your size and weight.|$|R
6000|$|... "No you don't," [...] {{snapped the}} earl. [...] "You think <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> that I think your friend isn't {{good enough to}} marry my daughter. You think that I'm an incurable snob. And I've no doubt he thinks so, too, though I took the trouble to explain my {{attitude}} to him when we last met. You're wrong. It isn't that at all. When I say 'I'm the Earl of Marshmoreton', I mean that I'm a poor spineless fool who's afraid {{to do the right}} thing because he daren't go in the teeth of the family." ...|$|E
60|$|I'd better {{explain what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> There was a girl. Now, a girl, {{as far as}} I am concerned, is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album; but I conceded the {{existence}} of the animal in order to retain Kerner's friendship. He showed me her picture in a locket--she was a blonde or a brunette--I have forgotten which. She worked in a factory for eight dollars a week. Lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication, I will add that the girl had worked for five years to reach that supreme elevation of remuneration, beginning at $1.50 per week.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Of course I shall {{get over}} it. You don't suppose I'm {{going to sit}} down and die of a broken heart, I hope, or be an old maid living on a pittance from the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers' Association. But my heart is broken, all the same. What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> is that I know that what has {{happened}} to me with Marcus will not happen to me ever again. In the world for me there is Marcus {{and a lot of other}} men of whom one is just the same as another. Well, if I can't have love, that's no reason why I should have poverty. If Mangan has nothing else, he has money.|$|E
60|$|I {{retired to}} my room and wrote to my uncle Starkweather, telling him exactly what had happened, and inclosing him a copy of my husband's letter. This done, I went out for a little while to breathe the fresh air and to think. I was soon weary, and went back again {{to my room}} to rest. My kind old Benjamin left me at perfect liberty to be alone as long as I pleased. Toward the {{afternoon}} I began to feel a little more like my old self again. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could think of Eustace without bursting out crying, and could speak to Benjamin without distressing and frightening the dear old man.|$|R
60|$|Which is {{my account}} of the Creation. And <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> it, <b>that</b> Life is not and never was {{anything}} but living creatures. That's what life is and will be just living creatures, no matter how large you make the capital L. Out of living creatures the material cosmos was made: out {{of the death of}} living creatures, when their little living bodies fell dead and fell asunder into all sorts of matter and forces and energies, sun, moons, stars and worlds. So you got the universe. Where you got the living creature from, that first one, don't ask me. He was just there. But he was a little person with a soul of his own. He wasn't Life with a capital L.|$|R
6000|$|In {{using such}} {{argument}} as that, Mrs Dale showed her weakness, and the squire was not slow {{to take advantage}} of it. [...] "Your duty is to them," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>I</b> do not <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> that your duty is to let them act in any way that may best please them for the moment. I can understand that they should be run away with by some romantic nonsense, but I cannot understand it of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You cannot {{love her}} as I love her. I {{will talk to}} you on this matter openly, as I have never yet talked to any one. Since first I saw Clara Desmond, the only wish of {{my life has been}} that I might have her for my wife. I have longed for her as a child longs--if you know what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> When I saw that she was old enough to {{understand}} what love meant, I told her what was in my heart, and she accepted my love. She swore to me that she would be mine, let mother or brother say what they would. As sure as you are standing there a living man she loved me with all truth. And that I loved her--! Herbert, I have never loved aught but her; nothing else!--neither man nor woman, nor wealth nor title. All I ask is that I may have that which was my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You guessed quite right," [...] laughed Old Mother Nature. [...] "Nevertheless, he {{has reason}} to fear being dug out. You see, out where he lives, Grizzly, the big cousin of Buster Bear, also lives, and Grizzly is very fond of a Marmot dinner when he can get one. He is so big and strong and has such great claws that he can pull the rocks apart and dig Whistler out. By the way, I {{forgot to tell you}} that Whistler is also called the Gray Marmot and the Hoary Marmot. He lives on grass and other green things and, like Johnny Chuck, gets very fat in the fall and then sleeps all winter. There are one or two other Marmots in the Far West who live farther south than does Whistler, but their habits are much the same as those of Whistler and Johnny Chuck. None of them are social. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> you never find two Marmot homes very close together. In this they differ from Johnny's smaller cousin, Yap Yap the Prairie Dog. Yap Yap wouldn't be happy if he didn't have close neighbors of his own kind. He {{has one of the most}} social natures of all my little people." ...|$|E
6000|$|Impersonal emotion! And what--I thought do <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that?</b> Surely I mean: That is not Art, which, while I, am contemplating it, inspires me {{with any}} active or {{directive}} impulse; that is Art, when, for however brief a moment, it replaces within me interest in myself by interest in itself. For, let me suppose {{myself in the}} presence of a carved marble bath. If my thoughts be [...] "What could I buy that for?" [...] Impulse of acquisition; or: [...] "From what quarry did it come?" [...] Impulse of inquiry; or: [...] "Which would be the right end for my head?" [...] Mixed impulse of inquiry and acquisition--I am at that moment insensible to it as a work of Art. But, if I stand before it vibrating at sight of its colour and forms, if ever so little and for ever so short a time, unhaunted by any definite practical thought or impulse--to that extent and for that moment it has stolen me away out of myself and put itself there instead; has linked me to the universal by making me forget the individual in me. And for that moment, and only while that moment lasts, it is to me a work of Art. The word [...] "impersonal," [...] then, is but used in this my definition to signify momentary forgetfulness of one's own personality and its active wants.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean unbending, strong, {{not to be}} {{overcome}} by outside circumstances. If Mr. Annesley had not spoken to me as he did last night,--could never have so spoken to me,--I {{should have been a}} miserable girl, but my love for him would have been just as stern. I should have remained and thought of it, and have been unhappy through my whole life. But he has spoken, and I am exultant. <b>That</b> is what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> stern. All <b>that</b> is most important, at any rate to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I am {{therefore}} {{inclined to}} assume that the real root of alchemy is to be sought less in philosophical doctrines than in the projections of individual investigators. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> this <b>that</b> while working on his chemical experiments the operator had certain psychic experiences which appeared to him as the particular behaviour of the chemical process. Since {{it was a question of}} projection, he was naturally unconscious of the fact that the experience had nothing to do with matter itself (that is, with matter as we know it today). He experienced his projection as a property of matter; but what he was in reality experiencing was his own unconscious. In this way he recapitulated the whole history of mankind's knowledge of nature.... Such projections repeat themselves whenever man tries to explore an empty darkness and involuntarily fills it with living form." [...] (Part 3, Chapter 2.1).|$|R
5000|$|Affordance {{is a term}} {{introduced}} by psychologist James J. Gibson. In his 1979 book [...] "The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception", he writes: “The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford {{is found in the}} dictionary, but the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> it something <b>that</b> refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarily of the animal and the environment” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, my dear children, is {{the reality}} of this grave {{business}} to-day, as indeed it is the real and practical end of all true religion. This is your sacrament urn, your soldier's oath. You salute and give your fealty to the coming Kingdom of God. And upon that I would have you fix your minds to the exclusion of much that, I know only too well, has been narrow and evil and sectarian in your preparation for this solemn rite. God is like a precious jewel found among much rubble; you must cast the rubble from you. The crowning triumph of the human mind is simplicity; the supreme significance of God lies in his unity and universality. The God you salute to-day is the God of the Jews and Gentiles alike, the God of Islam, the God of the Brahmo Somaj, the unknown God of many a righteous unbeliever. He is not the God of those felted theologies and inexplicable doctrines with which your teachers may have confused your minds. I would have it very clear in your minds that having drunken the draught you should not reverence unduly the cracked old vessel that has brought it to your lips. I should be falling short of my duty if I did not make that and everything <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> altogether plain to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘My picture,’ Mr. Grewgious proceeded, ‘goes on to {{represent}} (under correction from you, Mr. Edwin), the true lover as ever impatient {{to be in}} the presence or vicinity of the beloved object of his affections; as caring very little for his case in any other society; and as constantly seeking that. If I was to say seeking that, as a bird seeks its nest, I should make an ass of myself, because that would trench upon what I understand to be poetry; and I am so far from trenching upon poetry at any time, that I never, to my knowledge, got within ten thousand miles of it. And I am besides totally unacquainted with the habits of birds, except the birds of Staple Inn, who seek their nests on ledges, and in gutter-pipes and chimneypots, not constructed for them by the beneficent hand of Nature. I beg, therefore, to be understood as foregoing the bird’s-nest. But my picture does represent the true lover as having no existence separable from that of the beloved object of his affections, and as living at once a doubled life and a halved life. And if I do not clearly express what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that,</b> it is either for the reason that having no conversational powers, I cannot express what I mean, or that having no meaning, I do not mean what I fail to express. Which, {{to the best of my}} belief, is not the case.’ ...|$|E

My dear Vivian, you have now spent upwards of a year under this roof, and your conduct has been as correct as the most rigid parent might require. I have not wished to {{interfere}} with the progress of your mind, and I regret it. I have been negligent, but not wilfully so. I do regret it; because, whatever may be your powers, Vivian, I at least have the advantage of experience. I see you smile at a word which I so often use. Well, well, were I to talk to you for ever, you would not understand what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> single word. The time will come when you will deem that single word everything. Ardent youths in their closets, Vivian, too often fancy that they are peculiar beings; and I {{have no reason to believe}} that you are an exception to the general rule. In passing one whole year of your life, as you have done, you doubtless imagine that you have been spending your hours in a manner which no others have done before. Trust me, my boy, thousands have done the same; and, what is of still more importance, thousands are doing, and will do, the same. Take the advice of one who has committed as many, ay more, follies than yourself; but who would bless the hour that he had been a fool if his experience might be of benefit to his beloved son." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposition}} of {{this thesis}} is that architecture {{is capable of}} conveying a sense of animation, movement and energy. These are elusive properties. Their perception perhaps emerges from the building's form or articulation (referential to life-like forms). It may emerge from correlation with living processes (change, reactivity). At its most elusive, the perception perhaps comes from a capacity for" animo" [...] . A kind of completeness, intrinsic intent, inherent life. The work of Calder and Calatrava is examined {{in order to understand}} how such a perception might arise and to clarify what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> "animo". <b>That</b> inquiry is one part in a yet broader sequence of events exploring ways in which buildings are made and reflecting on ways of working.

40|$|In this note, I {{sketch a}} proof {{that there can}} be no time {{observable}} in any “positive energy representation. ” What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> saying <b>that</b> “there is no time observable ” is simply that its spectral measure is identically zero. (I would guess that this has been proved elsewhere, but I have not seen a rigorous proof.) A time observable should be canonically conjugate to the energy observable. Let (S ↦ → E(S), t ↦ → Ut) be a system of imprimitivity. We suppose that S ↦ → E(S) represents the spectral measure for a time observable, and t ↦ → Ut represents the time translations (generated by the energy observable). Definition. We say that (S ↦ → E(S), t ↦ → Ut) satisfies the positive energy condition just in case t ↦ → Ut is strongly continuous and the generator H is a positive operator.

60|$|It {{may seem}} incomprehensible, even ridiculous, to some persons, {{but it is}} {{nevertheless}} true, that we were none of us ever on intimate terms with him. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> this, <b>that</b> he was a father to us, but never a companion. There was something in his manner, his quiet and unchanging manner, which kept us almost unconsciously restrained. I {{never in my life}} felt less at my ease--I knew not why at the time--than when I occasionally dined alone with him. I never confided to him my schemes for amusement as a boy, or mentioned more than generally my ambitious hopes, as a young man. It was not that he would have received such confidences with ridicule or severity, he was incapable of it; but that he seemed above them, unfitted to enter into them, too far removed by his own thoughts from such thoughts as ours.
