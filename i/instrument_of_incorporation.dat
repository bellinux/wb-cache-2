40|$|Ancillary {{obligation}} can {{be defined}} as an obligation of a limited liability company's member undertaken through the <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation,</b> which can take the form of monetary or non-monetary obligation (usually it is an obligation of a non-monetary character), which has a certain financial value and can be the object of a legally valid obligation. Ancillary obligations, as a contribution to activities of the company, are not regulated in the Law on Companies. The legal nature of this obligation is different from the obligation to make a contribution in money or in kind to a company's assets, to make additional pay-ins or from the landing of funds to the company. Ancillary obligation is an optional and additional obligation of a limited liability company's member and the obligation itself and its contents is defined in the <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation.</b> When a limited liability company's member undertakes an ancillary obligation this creates a distinctive relationship between the member and the company, concerning their respective obligations and the legal status of the company, as well as certain consequences derived from those obligations...|$|E
40|$|A company's {{own equity}} {{interest}} is an equity interest acquired {{from one of}} its members. It possible for a company to acquire a whole or a part of an equity interest of its member. There are different legal situations and modes in which a company can acquire an equity interest from its members. It is possible for a company to acquire an equity interest against the compensation (through redemption of equity interest or part thereof from a company member), in an unencumbered transaction (based on the gift), through compulsory redemption of equity interest of a deceased member (if a company has this right under its <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation),</b> upon exit of a company member, upon exclusion of a company member and following a status change. The paper concentrates on acquisition of an equity interest against a compensation paid to a company member and through the compulsory redemption of equity from the heirs of a deceased member. Acquisition of an equity interest against the payment of a compensation exists {{in a case of}} an exit of a company member based on justifiable reasons. However, the acquisition in that case is a consequence of an exit of a member and not of the company's intent...|$|E

While little of substance has changed in the intervening years, a number of potentially important new forums were established to facilitate international cooperation. By drawing on and modifying theories of hegemony, this article provides a theoretical context within which to explore one of these institutions: the Group of 20 (G- 20). The key question examined is whether institutions like the G- 20 are likely to provide genuine mechanisms for cooperation and inclusion or simply become <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> "hegemonic <b>incorporation.</b> " The argument here is that despite the continuing "structural" dominance of the international system by the United States and the Group of 7 (G 7) nations, the G- 20 provides some scope for other nations to influence outcomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} towards {{the classification of}} pitched and unpitched instruments in polyphonic audio. In particular, the presented study accounts for three aspects currently lacking in literature: model scalability to polyphonic data, model generalisation in respect to the number <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> and <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> perceptual information. Therefore, our goal is a unifying recognition framework which enables the extraction of the main instruments’ information. The applied methodology consists of training classifiers with audio descriptors, using extensive datasets to model the instruments sufficiently. All data consist of real world music, including categories of 11 pitched and 3 percussive instruments. We designed our descriptors by temporal integration of the raw feature values, which are directly extracted from the polyphonic data. Moreover, to evaluate the applicability of modelling temporal aspects in polyphonic audio, we studied the performance of different encodings of the temporal information. Along with accuracies of 63 % and 78 % for the pitched and percussive classification task, results show both the importance of temporal encoding as well as strong limitations of modelling it accurately. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{much of the}} {{developing}} world, sharp curettage (SC) is {{the most commonly used}} technique for treating incomplete abortion. The procedure is usually performed in a hospital setting where physicians and operating theatres are available; it often involves light to heavy sedation for pain control and an overnight hospital stay for patient recuperation and monitoring. This study examined the hypothesis that use of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) [...] a variation of vacuum aspiration (VA) [...] would be less costly than SC and thus be advantageous to healthcare systems with limited resources. The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify and, where possible, to explain the factors that contributed to cost differences between MVA and SC for treatment of incomplete abortion. To achieve this objective, researchers observed patient management and documented resource use at hospital sites in Kenya and Mexico. The results of the study support the researchers' hypothesis that, in most cases, treatment with MVA required a shorter patient stay and fewer hospital resources than SC, as the two techniques were practiced at the various study sites. The policy decision to adopt MVA, supported by procurement <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> and <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> training in its use, is the basic prerequisite to achieving reduced levels of resource use. The study results also suggest that the full advantages of MVA can be realized only if it is introduced in conjunction with certain changes in patient management, such as offering outpatient treatment for incomplete abortion. abortion hospital costs and resource utilization patient management manual vacuum aspiration sharp curettage...|$|R

40|$|Unsafely {{performed}} {{abortion is}} one of the five leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Many women who have undergone unsafe abortions enter the healthcare system to seek help for the resulting complications, including incomplete abortion. This human and financial cost of this health problem is tremendous, especially in the developing world. This study examined the potential for reducing costs to healthcare systems by changing the standard method of treatment for incomplete abortion. Vacuum aspiration (VA) {{has been shown to be}} safer than dilation and curettage (D&C) for uterine evacuation; the World Health Organization includes VA as an essential service at the first referral level. The technique most commonly used for treating first-trimester incomplete abortion in developing countries, however, is D&C. This study examined the hypothesis that use of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) - a variation of VA - would be less costly than D&C and thus advantageous to healthcare systems with limited resources. The purpose of the study was to identify and, where possible, to explain the factors that contributed to cost differences between MVA and D&C for treatment of first-trimester incomplete abortion. To achieve this objective, researchers observed patient management and documented resource use at hospital sites in Ecuador, Kenya, and Mexico. In most cases, treatment with MVA required a shorter patient stay and fewer hospital resources than D&C, as the two techniques were practiced at the various study sites. The policy decision to adopt MVA, supported by procurement <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> and <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> training in its use, is the chief prerequisite for achieving these improvements. But the full advantages of MVA are realized only if it is introduced in conjunction with certain changes in patient-management practices, such as offering outpatient treatment of incomplete abortion. Further, decentralizing MVA services can maximize the benefits of the technique, facilitating (hospitals'and) healthcare systems'efforts to decrease the cost of delivery service and improve the quality of care.

50|$|Electric folk (aka British folk rock) is {{the name}} given to the form of folk rock pioneered in Britain during the late 1960s by the bands Sweeney's Men, Fairport Convention, and Pentangle. It uses {{traditional}} British music and self-penned compositions in a traditional style, and is played {{on a combination of}} traditional and rock <b>instruments.</b> This <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> traditional British folk music influences gives electric folk its distinctly British character and flavour. It evolved out of the psychedelia-influenced folk rock of British acts such as Donovan, the Incredible String Band, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, but was also heavily influenced by such American folk rock bands as the Byrds, Love, and Buffalo Springfield. Electric folk was at its most significant and popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, when, in addition to Fairport and Pentangle, it was also taken up by groups such as Steeleye Span and the Albion Band.|$|R
40|$|Scandinavia {{represents}} {{a particular type}} of welfare state, characterized by institutionalized social rights, universal access, generous benefits, a high degree of public involvement and comparatively high levels of redistribution. The basically tax-based system, which was designed to constitute a basic safety net for all citizens from cradle to grave, has been remarkably generous - and thereby also costly. It is thus vulnerable in relation to newcomers who cannot support themselves economically. In all of Scandinavia, the welfare state was from the beginning the self-evident <b>instrument</b> for <b>incorporation</b> <b>of</b> newcomers. Gradually, this instrument has turned more controversial, in parallel with general processes of social reform, in which the restructuring of policies has been regarded as necessary in order to avoid dependency traps and "overconsumption".
