500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And I thought, this {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} episode, Barbara {{addresses}} the Doctor as [...] "Doctor Foreman", {{as this is}} the surname the Doctor's granddaughter Susan goes by, and the junkyard in which they find him bears the sign [...] "I.M. Foreman". When addressed by Ian with this name, the Doctor responds, [...] "Eh? Doctor who? What's <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about?" [...] Later, when Ian realises that [...] "Foreman" [...] is not the Doctor's name, Ian asks Barbara, [...] "Who is he? Doctor who?" [...] In an ultimately unused idea from documents written at the programme's inception, Barbara and Ian would have subsequently referred to the Doctor as [...] "Doctor Who", given their not knowing his name.|$|E

6000|$|... "What was <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about?" [...] said Silverbridge. All his preparations, all his eloquence, all his method, {{now seemed}} to have {{departed}} from him.|$|E

60|$|Northwick {{understood}} this {{too little to}} believe it; when <b>he</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> business; even the jokes among the men {{he was used to}} meant business.|$|R

60|$|Our first reunited Christmas-day was {{the most}} {{delightful}} one we have ever passed together.

I am sick of him saying, 'This is a coon, this is a buffoon.' I am sick of him talking about black people going to see movies. This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. I am sick of him. <b>He</b> <b>talked</b> about Whoopi, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about Oprah, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about me, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about Clint Eastwood.

6000|$|Neale {{would not}} accept the wager. What was <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about, anyway? What was this drift of things? His mind did not seem clear. Perhaps he had drunk too much. The eyes of both Ruby and Beauty Stanton troubled him. What had he done to these women? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{would you}} then be letting him come here as he likes, and {{settling}} nothing, and just maning {{to marry you}} or not, as he likes, and you and he talked of over the counthry these four months back, and <b>he</b> <b>talking</b> about you, jist as his misthress, through the counthry?" ...|$|E
