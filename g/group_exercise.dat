Radiated control (RC) Group 7. "Thyradin" injected (TR) "Thyradin" (thyroid preparation) was injected 0. 2 c. c. (contains 10 γ of iodine) per 10 grams of body weight, and then the animals were exposed to X-ray on the 7 th day after irradiation. <b>Exercised</b> <b>groups</b> were made to run in the cylindrical tread-mill (80 cm in circumference, 8 rotations per minute, i. e. the animals have to run at a speed of 6. 4 m per minute). Irradiated groups received 600 r, 660 r and 840 r of X-ray at 99 r per minute. Gas analyses were done in order to evaluate the metabolic level of the exercise on one mouse in each group which was made to run in another tread-mill of the same diameter, rotating in the same speed as one described above, and located in an air-tight chamber shown in fig. 1. The air sample from this chamber was analysed with Scholander's apparatus. This results are as follows: 1) The metabolism increased by the exercise showing 33. 85 % (mean) increased of the oxygen consumption. 2) The metabolism was accelerated gradually by the "Thyradin" treatment arriving the maximum arround the 6 th day after the injection, showing 42. 99 % of the increase of oxygen consumption. 3) The survival rate in the <b>groups</b> which were <b>exercised</b> before the irradiation was higher than that in the group of radiated control and the <b>group</b> <b>exercised</b> after the irradiation.
