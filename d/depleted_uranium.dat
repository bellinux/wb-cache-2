5|$|<b>Depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. <b>Depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> plates. The use of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E

40|$|Potential {{environmental}} hazards of radionuclides are often {{studied at the}} individual level. Sufficient toxicogenomics data at the molecular/cellular level for understanding the effects and modes of toxic action (MoAs) of radionuclide is still lacking. The current article introduces transcriptomic data generated from a recent ecotoxicological study, with the aims to characterize the MoAs of a metallic radionuclide, <b>deplete</b> <b>uranium</b> (DU) in an ecologically and commercially important fish species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Salmon were exposed to three concentrations (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0  mg/L) of DU for 48  h. Short-term global transcriptional responses were studied using Agilent custom-designed high density 60, 000 -feature (60  k) salmonid oligonucleotide microarrays (oligoarray). The microarray datasets deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO ID: GSE 58824) were associated with a recently published study by Song et al. (2014) in BMC Genomics. The authors describe the experimental data herein to build a platform for better understanding the toxic mechanisms and ecological hazard of radionuclides such as DU in fish...|$|R
50|$|Thirdly, {{there are}} {{numerous}} technologies that are extremely expensive to develop and deploy, but once they are deployed by all nations, the relative value of the technology is significantly lowered. Advancements are extremely valuable when only one nation or power block possesses them, but once all nations have access to similar technologies, there is a requirement to deploy weapons that can defeat the original advance. This leaves the parties {{in much the same}} position as they were initially, while the cost of the platform will nevertheless have increased. This forms a cyclical arms race where unit prices continue to increase but the balance of power remains the same. Reactive tank armor resulted {{in a number of different}} advanced anti-tank munition (top attack, tandem charge, <b>deplete</b> <b>uranium</b> penetrators) with the end result that all new tanks are required to have both advanced armor and advanced munitions, but relative to each other are no more powerful.|$|R
50|$|While alpha {{particle}} emitters {{such as those}} in <b>depleted</b> uranium(DU) (i.e., <b>uranium</b> 238) are not a hazard at a distance, {{alpha particle}} measurements are necessary for safe handling of projectile dust, or of damaged vehicles with DU armor.|$|R
5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 {{and with a}} correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> or 'DU'. To {{be considered}} 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should {{be no more than}} 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. <b>Depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices.

5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha). Many accusations {{of human rights}} violations against the United States were connected with the First and Second Battles of Fallujah. Following the assault, the United States military admitted it had employed white phosphorus artillery rounds, the use of which is not permitted in civilian areas under the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Several Marines, all {{of them from the}} 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, were later charged (but not convicted) with executing Iraqi prisoners. Some British advisers also complained that the Marines had little regard for civilian casualties and had used munitions containing <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> that caused birth defects for years after the battle.|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to <b>deplete</b> these natural <b>uranium</b> resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced Converter Reactors (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only <b>depleted</b> natural <b>uranium</b> (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced converter reactors, their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used up in burners. Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total installed nuclear capacity increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030. The analysis shows that a combination of advanced and burner reactors, as compared to the use of burners only, could lead to cumulative, high-grade uranium savings greater than 70...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the Geochron was mainly attributed to Clair Cameron Patterson’s application of Pb-Pb dating on meteorites in 1956. The Pb ratios of three stony and two iron meteorites were measured. The dating of meteorites would then help Patterson in determining not only the age of these meteorites but also the age of Earth’s formation. By dating meteorites Patterson was directly dating the age of various planetesimals. Assuming the process of elemental differentiation is identical on Earth {{as it is on}} other planets, the core of these planetesimals would be <b>depleted</b> of <b>uranium</b> and thorium, while the crust and mantle would contain higher U/Pb ratios. As planetesimals collided, various fragments were scattered and produced meteorites. Iron meteorites were identified as pieces of the core, while stony meteorites were segments of the mantle and crustal units of these various planetesimals.|$|R

5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. <b>Depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium,</b> which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

40|$|Aquitard {{windows are}} known to occur in unconsolidated aquifer systems and {{represent}} areas of focused recharge to otherwise confined underlying aquifers. The study herein focused on a known window site affecting the Memphis aquifer located in the Sheahan wellfield in Shelby County, Tennessee. Uranium- and thorium-series radioisotopes were evaluated from production wells sampled in the wellfield and compared to other geochemical characteristics of the system. From the research, a conceptual model was realized whereby higher uranium concentrations from near-surface waters flow through a redox barrier in the aquitard window and become <b>depleted</b> in <b>uranium.</b> Further, 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio increased downgradient of the recharge source by alpha-recoil mobilization of 234 U via 234 Th, and possibly leaching of uranium bound by iron hydroxides via dissolution and subsequent precipitation by reducing waters flowing to downgradient wells. The behavior of the hydrogeochemical tracers could be best described in the conceptual model by normalizing uranium to Fe 2 C throughout the system. The use of the [U]–[Fe 2 C] pair provides {{a useful tool for}} understanding of the mixing behavior near focused recharge sites with redox barriers and may be useful for developing aquifer behavior models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the work {{carried out by}} the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) on the Kayelekera Uranium Deposit in Northern Malawi between 1983 and 1991. This {{is one of the largest}} Karoo-age sandstone hosted uranium deposits yet discovered. Approximately 200 boreholes, about 60 % of which were fully cored, were drilled into the deposit during this evaluation. An important part of the ore reserve estimation undertaken by the CEGB at Kayelekera was gaining an understanding of the uranium decay series distribution within the deposit. Being located in a near surface environment the deposit is subject to weathering effects caused by oxidising groundwater. Three ore types are recognised, reduced facies ore, oxidised facies ore and transitional facies ore containing both oxidised and reduced material in varying proportions. Being more mobile under oxidising conditions uranium tends to be leached from the oxidised parts of the deposit and re-deposited in more reducing parts however its gamma emitting daughters tend to be less mobile in an oxidising environment leading to a marked disequilibrium between uranium and its daughters with the oxidized facies ore being <b>depleted</b> in <b>uranium</b> relative to its daughters and the reduced facies ore often showing relative enrichment...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to advanced propulsion that could meet the objectives of the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) is the open cycle gas core nuclear rocket (GCR). The energy in this device is generated by a fissioning uranium plasma which heats, through radiation, a propellant that flows around the core and exits through a nozzle, thereby converting thermal energy into thrust. Although such a scheme can produce very attractive propulsion parameters in the form of high specific impulse and high thrust, it does suffer from serious physics and engineering problems that must be addressed if it is to become a viable propulsion system. Among the major problems that must be solved are the confinement of the uranium plasma, potential instabilities and control problems associated with the dynamics of the uranium core, and the question of startup and fueling of such a reactor. In this paper, the authors focus their attention on the problems of equilibria and stability of the uranium care, and examine the potential use of an externally applied magnetic field for these purposes. They find that steady state operation of the reactor is possible only for certain care profiles that may not be compatible with the radiative aspect of the system. The authors also find that the system is susceptible to hydrodynamic and acoustic instabilities that could <b>deplete</b> the <b>uranium</b> fuel in a short time if not properly suppressed...|$|R
