5000|$|Maurice [...] "Mories" [...] de Jong {{established}} Gnaw Their Tongues, originally {{conceived as}} Dimlit Hate Cellar, {{as a new}} outlet for his music in 2004. Previously, de Jong had been active musically since 1988 and composing music under several aliases since the early nineties. Gnaw Their Tongues' full-length debut, titled Spit at Me and Wreak Havoc <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Flesh,</b> was independently released in January 2006. The album comprised seven lengthy drone pieces which drew inspiration from black metal and utilized sampling. Immediately de Jong began issuing multiple albums within months of each other, establishing himself as a prolific composer and musician. In 2007 An Epiphanic Vomiting of Blood was issued by Burning World Records and was critically well received.|$|R
5000|$|Gnaw Their Tongues is an {{experimental}} musical project started by Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Maurice de Jong, {{otherwise known as}} Mories. It was founded in 2004 and produced a debut album in 2006 titled Spit at Me and Wreak Havoc <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Flesh.</b> The output of Gnaw Their Tongues is extensive, with over thirty releases being attributed to its name. The name of the project is taken from passage 16:10-11 from the Book of Revelation: [...] "The fifth angel, who poured out his vial upon {{the seat of the}} beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the very}} {{extremity}} of want, I had recourse again, and yet again, {{to the little}} packet in the case--the five letters. How splendid that month seemed whose skies had beheld the rising of these five stars! It was always at night I visited them, and not daring to ask every evening for a candle in the kitchen, I bought a wax taper and matches to light it, and at the study-hour stole up to the dormitory and <b>feasted</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> crust from the Barmecide's loaf. It did not nourish me: I pined on it, and got as thin as a shadow: otherwise I was not ill.|$|R

"I hope I {{would never}} turn <b>my</b> back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own <b>flesh</b> and blood," [...] he {{returned}} with emphasis; but, to my anxious ear, with more of temper than affection. [...] "I could never forget you were my sister's son. I regard this as a manifest duty. I {{have no choice but}} to accept the entire responsibility of the position you have made." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clinging to the woodwork, {{staggering}} {{with the}} roll of the ship, and aided by the cook, I managed to slip into a rough woollen undershirt. <b>On</b> the instant <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> was creeping and crawling from the harsh contact. He noticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing, and smirked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, my heart's comfort, I never raised hand to woman yet, and {{it would}} be a passing strange thing if I began <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own <b>flesh</b> and blood. It was a woman's hand which cast this lime into mine eyes, and though I saw her stoop, and might well have stopped her ere she threw, I deemed it unworthy of my knighthood to hinder or balk one of her sex." ...|$|R

60|$|No moments here to {{be stolen}} for my beloved books. And what had John Barleycorn to do with such strenuous, Stoic toil of a lad just turned fifteen? He had {{everything}} to do with it. Let me show you. I asked myself if this were the meaning of life--to be a work-beast? I knew of no horse in the city of Oakland that worked the hours I worked. If this were living, I was entirely unenamoured of it. I remembered my skiff, lying idle and accumulating barnacles at the boat-wharf; I remembered the wind that blew every day on the bay, the sunrises and sunsets I never saw; the bite of the salt air in my nostrils, the bite of the salt water <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> when I plunged overside; I remembered all the beauty and the wonder and the sense-delights of the world denied me. There was only one way to escape my deadening toil. I must get out and away on the water. I must earn <b>my</b> bread <b>on</b> the water. And the way of the water led inevitably to John Barleycorn. I did not know this. And when I did learn it, I was courageous enough not to retreat back to my bestial life at the machine.|$|R

I managed to worm out of {{her that she had}} run away from home before her confinement, and had gone to some strange place to be confined, where they'd ill-treated and robbed her. She hadn't long got away from the wretches who'd done it. By the time I'd found out all this, her baby was quite quiet, and ready to go to sleep. I gave it her back. She said nothing, but took and kissed my hand, her lips feeling like burning coals <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>flesh.</b> 'You're kindly welcome,' says I, a little flustered at such a queer way of thanking me. 'Just wait a bit while I speak to my husband.' Though she'd been and done wrong, I couldn't {{for the life of me}} help pitying her, for her fierce ways. She was so young, and so forlorn and ill, and had such a {{beautiful}} face (little Mary's is the image of it, 'specially about the eyes), and seemed so like a lady, that it was almost a sin, as I thought, to send her to such a place as a workhouse.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have just}} had a <b>feast</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{birthday}} at which we had three of the Ringaromas, and I wish they had been three CURACOAS - say yourself, Hoskin, and Burney the ever Great. (Consider this an invitation.) Our boys had got the thing up regardless. There were two huge sows - oh, brutes of animals that would have broken down a hansom cab - four smaller pigs, two barrels of beef, and a horror of vegetables and fowls. We sat down between forty and fifty in a big new native house behind the kitchen that you have never seen, and ate and public spoke till all was blue. Then we had about half an hour's holiday with some beer and sherry and brandy and soda to restrengthen the European heart, and then out to the old native house to see a siva. Finally, all the guests were packed off in a trackless black night and down a road that was rather fitted for the CURACOA than any human pedestrian, though to be sure I {{do not know the}} draught of the CURACOA. My ladies one and all desire to be particularly remembered to our friends on board, and all look forward, as I do myself, in the hope of your return. - Yours sincerely, ...|$|R

5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.

Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come.

60|$|When I {{opened my}} eyes again it was night, and doubtless I should have slept on through many hours more {{had it not been}} for a dreadful itch and pain that took me in every part, till at length I sprang up and cursed in my agony. At first I was at a loss to know what occasioned this torment, till I {{perceived}} that the air was alive with gnat-like insects which made a singing noise, and then settling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>flesh,</b> sucked blood and spat poison into the wound at one and the same time. These dreadful insects the Spaniards name mosquitoes. Nor were they the only flies, for hundreds of other creatures, no bigger than a pin's head, had fastened on to me like bulldogs to a baited bear, boring their heads into the flesh, where in the end they cause festers. They are named garrapatas by the Spanish, and I take them to be the young of the tic. Others there were, also, too numerous to mention, and of every shape and size, though they had this in common, all bit and all were venomous. Before the morning these plagues had driven me almost to madness, for in no way could I obtain relief from them. Towards dawn I went and lay in the water, thinking to lessen my sufferings, but before I had been there ten minutes I saw a huge crocodile rise up from the mud beside me. I sprang away to the bank horribly afraid, for never before had I beheld so monstrous and evil-looking a brute, to fall again into the clutches of the creatures, winged and crawling, that were waiting for me there by myriads.|$|R
