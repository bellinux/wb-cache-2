40|$|Multi-pass slab vertical-horizontal (V-H) {{rolling process}} with {{variable}} <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> shape have been simulated with explicit dynamic {{finite element method}} and updating geometric method. The distributions of plastic strain contour in slab during rolling process with different <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and under different rolling stage have been obtained. The results show that there exist two thin strain assembling zones in slab when the flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> is used, and there just exist one strain assembling zone in slab when the <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove is used. And compared the deformation equality between flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove, the later {{is better than the}} former, which supplies the theory prove to the slab deformation distribution during V-H rolling process and is helpful for predicting the slab texture...|$|R
40|$|The multi-pass vertical-horizontal (V-H) {{rolling process}} using plain-barreled <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and two grooved <b>edging</b> <b>rolls</b> with inward chamfer radius R= 50 mm and R= 80 mm was modeled {{by way of}} {{explicit}} dynamic FEM and updated geometries, and the slab corner metal flow under the conditions as above was analyzed. With the specified rolling schedule, {{it was found that}} the slab corner metal is curling and overturning onto the slab top surface when using the plain-barreled <b>edging</b> <b>roll,</b> and the slab corner metal is kept onto the line intersecting the top surface with side surface of the slab when using grooved <b>edging</b> <b>roll...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Rock & <b>Roll</b> <b>Machine</b> is {{the second}} studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, {{released}} in 1977. The album was released on RCA Records in the US in 1978 and again on MCA Records (MCA-1455) in 1985. The album resulted in the band's first hit single, a cover version of Joe Walsh's [...] "Rocky Mountain Way". Depending on the country of issue, the album may also be named Rock and <b>Roll</b> <b>Machine</b> or Rock 'N' <b>Roll</b> <b>Machine.</b> The MCA issue is noteworthy in that the album was re-mastered by Bob Ludwig at his Masterdisk location {{as opposed to the}} original RCA which was mastered by Jack Adelman at RCA.|$|R

25|$|Hemming and seaming are two similar {{metalworking}} {{processes in}} which a sheet metal <b>edge</b> is <b>rolled</b> over onto itself. Hemming is the {{process in which the}} <b>edge</b> is <b>rolled</b> flush to itself, while a seam joins the edges of two materials.|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} design blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> for {{arbitrary}} rim shape compact range reflectors is presented. The reflectors may be center-fed or offset-fed. The method leads to <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> with minimal surface discontinuities. It is {{shown that the}} reflectors designed using the prescribed method can be defined analytically using simple expressions. A procedure to obtain optimum <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> parameter is also presented. The procedure leads to blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> that minimize the diffracted fields emanating from the junction between the paraboloid and the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> surface while satisfying certain constraints regarding the reflector size and the minimum operating frequency of the system...|$|R

40|$|In {{a compact}} range (which employs a {{parabolic}} main reflector to convert the spherical wave originating from a point source to a reflected plane wave) the edge-generated diffractive fields degrade the uniformity of the plane wave. To reduce the energy diffracted from the edge surfaces, terminations {{can be added to}} the parabola, such that the slope of the surface is continuous at the junctions. This paper discusses the problem of designing an optimized <b>rolled</b> <b>edge.</b> Two examples of reflectors with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> are presented, one with elliptic <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> and the other with blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges,</b> both adhering to the same constraints on minimum operating frequency and size. It was found that the reflector with the cosine-squared blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> has a much larger usable target zone than the one with the elliptic <b>rolled</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
