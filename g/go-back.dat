50|$|A female elf {{with brown}} hair and brown eyes. She was young when Kahvi {{returned}} with Tyldak to the Go-Backs after the Palace was lost, and shot at them. Despite that, she is rather timid for a <b>Go-Back.</b> Appeared in Going Back.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Go-Backs,</b> {{as their}} name suggests, desire {{to return to}} the Palace. However, the Palace had long been claimed by King Guttlekraw's trolls, enemies of the elves. In response, the <b>Go-Backs</b> have become a race of brutally barbaric warriors, {{constantly}} fighting the trolls until the war had become their [...] "meat and milk". Their life was short and harsh, and they opted not to use magic because it made life deceptively soft. They value offspring, but believe in a warrior's early death. The <b>Go-Backs</b> had domesticated giant elks for use as mounts, and primarily dwell in lodges built into the mountains. Unknown to the <b>Go-Backs,</b> their chief Kahvi actually has long hidden Wolf-rider blood.|$|R
50|$|In the German edition, the <b>Go-backs</b> {{are called}} snow-elves.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Go-Backs</b> are {{the fourth}} and last Elf tribe {{encountered}} during the Original Quest. Originally a migrating tribe, the <b>Go-Backs</b> are named after a sudden desire to [...] "go back" [...] to the palace of the High Ones. The Palace has a strong pull on all elves once in range, the <b>Go-Backs</b> {{were the first to}} stumble on it since the High Ones were driven away. First appearing to save Cutter and his followers from a war party of trolls in a snow-bound tundra, the <b>Go-Backs</b> are arctic-dwelling elk-herders, bearing about the same resemblance to Sami as the Wolfriders do to Iroquois and the Sun Folk to Mesoamericans (that is to say, mainly in costume). They are highly warlike and hardened, being locked in continual strife with the trolls who bar their way to the palace. They have a prejudice against [...] "magic", but not to the extent of persecuting its users. The <b>Go-Backs,</b> so removed from magic, no longer rely on Recognition to procreate. They provided the bulk of the military strength that allowed the completion of the first quest, and lost half their numbers in doing so.|$|R
50|$|Among the Go-backs one further form {{of sexual}} {{relationship}} exists: the orgy. In <b>Go-back</b> society both sexes fight in wars. Thus {{the night before}} a battle is usually marked by frenzied dancing followed by group sexual activity. This is partly in order to celebrate life before risking it in battle, and partly to scatter seed as widely as possible so that those females who survive will replenish the tribe. In addition, the founder of this tribe favored quantity over quality in reproduction and thus Recognition's influence was significantly reduced to allow for more frequent conceptions.|$|E
50|$|In retail terms, a <b>go-back</b> is {{an item of}} {{merchandise}} which must be placed back on the store shelves. Such items usually accumulate during the store's open hours, and comprise a combination of returned items, items customers {{have decided not to}} purchase, and items store employees may have found left lying on the wrong shelf. Go-backs can often accumulate over several days because businesses, especially larger department stores, tend to have other priorities at the time and not enough employment to put the go-backs away. Go-backs are sometimes referred to as re-shop, put-backs, misplaced, shop-backs, returns, abandons, left-behinds, loose-stock, or shop-downs.|$|E
40|$|Faster, better {{networks}} algorithms {{are often}} being discovered, {{and it is}} desirable {{to be able to}} replace an old algorithm by a new {{in a manner that is}} completely transparent to the application using it. This paper investigates the technique for ensuring such transparency for protocols expressed in SDL, via bisimulation checking. We discuss the main issues involved in translating SDL into Concurrency Workbench, a tool for performing bisimulation checking, and illustrate the feasibility of the technique by comparing the SDL specification of the <b>Go-Back</b> protocol with the family of new protocols, called Asynchronous Retransmission Go-Back-(AR). The latter perform better in environ-ments characterized by high error rates and/or large propagation delays. ...|$|E
50|$|When the <b>Go-Backs</b> {{tried to}} return to the Palace, they were stopped by the Ice Trolls, who assumed that once the elves were reinstalled in the Palace they would enslave the trolls as their {{ancestors}} had. War ensued between the two groups and was underway when the <b>Go-Backs</b> rescued the Wolfriders and forged an alliance with them.|$|R
50|$|After the Palace is won, the <b>Go-Backs</b> stay near it, {{but not for}} long. When trolls {{captured}} Ekuar, Rayek {{blamed the}} <b>Go-Backs,</b> and banished them by creating a gorge which prevented them from crossing into the mountains. Kahvi became separated {{from the rest of}} her tribe, and goes to look for the palace Rayek spirited away, to take revenge. She stays with the Wolfriders for some years.|$|R
50|$|When {{she finally}} {{returns to the}} <b>Go-Backs,</b> Zey is their new chief. She {{suggests}} raiding the Sun Village with a small party to steal the Little Palace. After this is a failure, Zey carries all-out war to Sorrow's End. Kahvi realizes that war is not a way to regain honor. She kills Zey, and leads the <b>Go-Backs</b> back to the Frozen Mountains, even without the Little Palace.In the following, the <b>Go-Backs</b> return to their ways (minus the Palace-searching). Kahvi stays chief, but often leaves the tribe to her second-in-command Mardu, once to Blue Mountain {{trying to get a}} new trophy instead of the Palace for the tribe, discovering her own past, and once trying to find Cutter to bear his child.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} using Markov chains to model the error process in the data blocks delivered by the physical layer of a WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) cellular system. Starting from the results on the error statistics obtained from a suitable simulation tool, which jointly performs system and link level analysis, we first classify the users on the basis of performance level and burstiness, then we provide some guidelines for the design of Markov models in the different system and channel conditions. The performance of an ARQ (<b>Go-Back</b> N) protocol at the link layer is taken as a reference to test the reliability of the proposed models. It is shown that the perspective of using simple error models in the analysis of upper-layer protocol is feasible in many cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Collection of ground truth data provided ground cover {{percent and the}} components of ground cover makeup. Percent bare soil appears to have greatest influence on imagery density of sites studied. Forage density estimates can be made on band 5 of MSS, provided site category identification is known. Additional data are provided concerning forage density and vegetation-soil relationship by color composites of MSS imagery. Reflectance differences shown on MSS bands 6 and 7 by Sand Hills lakes are related to water quality and possibly more specifically to total dissolved ions present in the water. Winter imagery with snow cover and low sun angle shows a marked enhancement of topography are associated with differences in forage density. High altitude color infrared photography {{appears to be a}} usable tool for recognition, measurement, and evaluation of <b>go-back</b> land...|$|E
30|$|As part of reestablishing {{the land}} use of {{wildlife}} habitat, full shrubs such as Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis) {{had to be}} reestablished. Such reestablishment was difficult in the northeastern {{corner of the state}} which is transitional to the high plains and prairie ecosystems to the east and north. In the early years following the implementation of SMCRA, shrubs were assumed to invade, as was evident on many <b>go-back</b> agricultural hayland systems in Northeastern Wyoming. Early seeding used fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) as a substitute for big sagebrush. As mentioned earlier, southern sources of this seed did not allow for long-term establishment. Fall and spring seeding of shrub seed was conducted and often in the same drill rows as other plant lifeforms which often buried small seed and provided competition from perennial grasses. Winter broadcast seeding of big sagebrush and other shrub seeds is now considered a desirable method of shrub establishment.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{thousand}} years completely unmapped, {{but the most}} recent bits revealed seem like Kahvi one day just did not come back {{from one of her}} expeditions, and the <b>Go-Backs</b> split, some staying in the Frozen Mountains, others settling the New Land - Teir's people. The <b>Go-Backs</b> who stayed in the Frozen Mountains joined the other elves in the Palace after its second restoration; many of them joined Venka in her search for Kahvi.|$|R
50|$|Zey {{became chief}} of the <b>Go-Backs</b> after they lost the Palace to Rayek. After Kahvi said she could bring back {{a piece of the}} Palace, he was afraid she would take over the tribe again, and more or less told his friend Chot to make sure she would not come back. After Chot reports Kahvi's death, he leads the <b>Go-Backs</b> to a brutal raid of Sorrow's end. Kahvi killed him, ending the fight for the Little Palace.|$|R
40|$|Accompanied by the {{development}} of microfabrication techniques, such as MEMS and micro-TAS, there has been increasing interests on the methodology to generate a desired motion on a micro object in a solution environment. It is well know that the principle to create an electric motor in a macroscopic scale is not applicable to a micro system because of the enhancement of sticky interaction and higher viscosity in micrometer sized system. On the other hand, living organisms generate various motions under isothermal condition in a well-regulated manner. Despite the past intensive studies, the underlying mechanism of the biological molecular motors has not been unveiled yet. Under such development stage of science and technology at the present, we are performing the study toward real-world modeling on the emergence of regular motion in micro system. In this paper, we report a novel experimental system on the generation of regular movement, such as periodic <b>go-back</b> motion and circular motion, for a micro object under DC electric field...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} using Markov chains to model the error process in the data blocks delivered by the physical layer of wideband code division multiple access a (WCDMA) cellular system. Suitable Markov models (MM) are designed to fulfil the two following objectives: First, an upper layer protocol supplied by the output obtained from the MM should behave as if it were running on the actual physical layer; second, MM parameters should be linked via simple relationships to the main physical layer parameters. Starting from the results on the error statistics obtained from a suitable simulation tool which jointly performs system and link level analysis, we first classify the users on the basis of performance level and burstiness, and then, we provide some guidelines for the design of Markov models in the different system and channel conditions. The performance of an automatic repeat request (ARQ) (<b>Go-Back</b> N) protocol at the link layer is taken as an example to test the accuracy of the proposed models. It is shown that the perspective of using simple error models in the analysis of upper layer protocols is feasible in many cases...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the series}} Kahvi it is {{revealed}} that the <b>Go-Backs</b> were originally a splinter group of the Wolfriders, who had lost their wolf blood [...] "because of Willowgreen's trickery." [...] What exactly that looked like, or how exactly the <b>Go-Backs</b> became stag-riders and searchers for the palace, are yet untold stories. (A prose story about the healer Willowgreen and her [...] "trickery" [...] was {{to appear in the}} book [...] "Hunter's Dawn" [...] in the mid-1990s, but that volume was repeatedly delayed, then canceled.) ...|$|R

5000|$|While the Original High Ones {{are only}} a headlength shorter than humans and much slenderer, the Wolfriders and the <b>Go-Backs</b> tribes are between one half and one third of a human. The elves of Elfquest are broadly human in appearance, but are {{distinguished}} from humans by the following characteristics: ...|$|R
50|$|The soulname {{is known}} from {{conception}} to the child's parents, {{and it is}} forgotten by all involved at birth, later revealed only to the child in a spirit quest. It is often only revealed in Recognition to the Recognized lifemate, unless the elf decides to divulge the name willingly to another. However, this is rarely done; two notable occurrences are Dewshine, Tyleet and Scouter, and Nightfall and Redlance, before the fight for the palace with the <b>Go-Backs.</b> Generally, only Wolfriders had soulnames: According to Leetah {{in the very first}} album, the Sun Folk have either forgotten how to send or do so rarely, which eliminates the need to protect the inner self with a secret name. Gliders, on the other hand, are capable senders and have no soulnames either, and <b>Go-Backs</b> have no soulnames as well, with Kahvi being a possible exception.|$|R
50|$|Sending - {{the ability}} to {{exchange}} thoughts and feelings by telepathy. All elves appear to have the capacity for sending, but some tribes use it more often than others; the Wolfriders send frequently, whereas the <b>Go-Backs</b> send very rarely and the Sun Folk hardly at all. Wolfriders can send to their wolves, but the wolves communicate in images more than words.|$|R
50|$|Skin color - elves {{generally}} {{exhibit the}} same range of variation as humans. The Sun Folk, adapted to desert conditions, have medium to dark brown skin. Wolfriders {{have adapted to}} cold temperate climates; they are pale pink or ruddy, but tan in hotter climates. <b>Go-backs</b> have a lighter complexion from living in Abode's northern mountains. Gliders—-who mostly lived inside a mountain-—are fair to palid.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} extreme longevity, elves {{have a very}} low birth rate. Stable and {{peaceful}} elf societies such as the Sun Folk and the Gliders have no deaths for long periods and therefore no births, while the Wolfriders and <b>Go-Backs,</b> plagued by centuries of war against humans and trolls respectively, have a higher birth rate in order to stabilize their populations, although still very low by human standards.|$|R
50|$|She became Kahvi's second-in-command {{after the}} war in Sorrow's End. It seems like {{she was the one}} {{actually}} taking care of the tribe, while their chief went to more or less crazy expeditions. She was at first the only one Kahvi trusted with the secret that the <b>Go-Backs</b> used to be Wolfriders.In Going Back she is depicted with light brown hair and brown eyes, but on a center-spread, she has red hair.Appears in Going Back and Kahvi.|$|R
50|$|The {{deceased}} Gliders, {{including the}} seven deceased {{members of the}} Chosen Eight, find a temporary home within Rayek, the powerful Sun Folk magic user, who bonds with them telepathically. Their souls are drawn into him, vastly increasing his own powers. (Siege at Blue Mountain, Secret of Two-Edge) The presence of {{the souls of the}} Gliders within his psyche drives Rayek mad with power, and in a rage, he destroys the home of another tribe of elves, the <b>Go-Backs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Go-Backs</b> are a {{tribe of}} elves in the comic series Elfquest. They named {{themselves}} from their goal {{to return to the}} Palace of the High Ones.They are hunters (probably gatherers, too) and, above all, warriors. Most of them care neither for the past nor for the future. They are the only known tribe that scorns magic - especially healing magic, since knowing that a healer is around makes warriors 'soft'.Their most notable tradition is dancing for their death.|$|R
50|$|When she awoke, {{she had no}} {{memories}} of her life prior, and so was trained by Sharf, {{the leader of the}} <b>Go-Backs,</b> to be the next chief. After inheriting the chief's braids upon Sharf's death, she led the <b>Go-Backs</b> for many years, though most of the time she would travel alone and allow others to lead. She gave birth to and raised two daughters, Vaya (who was killed during the Troll/Elf war for the palace) and Venka (fathered by her one-time lovemate, Rayek). During the Wolfriders' long sleep, she traveled with her lovemate Tyldak and was later joined by Tyldak's son, Windkin. During an attack by humans, Tyldak was mortally wounded and bled to death in Khavi's arms. Afterwards, she persuaded Windkin to sire a child on her, to have a small, living part of Tyldak. However, when she gave birth to her son, Teir, she immediately abandoned him to tribemates to raise, as she had really wanted a daughter. Years later, tired of her long life, she allowed herself to be hunted, and killed by, the human Lehrigen, allowing him to take her braids as a trophy he carried with him the rest of his life. She had long brown hair with double braids on each side (chief's braids) and green eyes.|$|R
50|$|Healing - {{the ability}} to heal injury or disease. Unscrupulous healers can invert the power by violently {{stimulating}} pain nerves to make the target experience agonizing pain. Conversely, the pleasure nerves can also be stimulated with equal strength, producing intensely pleasurable sensations that can dramatically enhance sexual experiences. Healers can also induce Recognition, {{with varying degrees of}} success. <b>Go-backs</b> stigmatize healers, believing they make warriors soft and careless. It is possible for an elf to heal a non-elf (such as a human) but this is significantly more difficult as their bodies are much less malleable.|$|R
