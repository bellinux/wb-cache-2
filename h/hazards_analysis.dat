40|$|A <b>hazards</b> <b>analysis</b> {{identifies}} the operation hazards and the positive measures that {{aid in the}} mitigation or prevention of the hazard. If the tasks are human intensive, the hazard analysis often credits the personnel training as contributing to the mitigation of the accident`s consequence or prevention of an accident sequence. To be able to credit worker training, {{it is important to}} understand the role of the training in the hazard analysis. Systematic training, known as systematic training design (STD), performance-based training (PBT), or instructional system design (ISD), uses a five-phase (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) model for the development and implementation of the training. Both a <b>hazards</b> <b>analysis</b> and a training program begin with a task analysis that documents the roles and actions of the workers. Though the tasks analyses are different in nature, there is common ground and both the hazard analysis and the training program can benefit from a cooperative effort. However, the cooperation should not end with the task analysis phase of either program. The information gained from the <b>hazards</b> <b>analysis</b> should be used in all five phases of the training development.

40|$|The {{physical}} and combustion properties of hydrogen {{give rise to}} hazards that must be considered when designing and operating a hydrogen system. One of the major concerns {{in the use of}} hydrogen is that of fire or detonation because of hydrogen's wide flammability range, low ignition energy, and flame speed. Other concerns include the contact and interaction of hydrogen with materials, such as the hydrogen embrittlement of materials and the formation of hydrogen hydrides. The low temperature of liquid and slush hydrogen bring other concerns related to material compatibility and pressure control; this is especially important when dissimilar, adjoining materials are involved. The potential hazards arising from these properties and design features necessitate a proper hydrogen <b>hazards</b> <b>analysis</b> before introducing a material, component, or system into hydrogen service.

40|$|For any safety-critical system, {{thorough}} and complete <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> must be performed {{if the system}} is to be acceptably safe to operate. For the emerging class of systems known as Systems of Systems (SoS), however, performing <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> is extremely difficult because {{of the complexity of}} SoS and the environments they inhabit.

A systematic process is defined for developing multi-agent models of SoS, starting from existing models in the MODAF architecture framework and proceeding to implemented simulation models.

40|$|In system development, epistemic {{uncertainty}} is an ever-present possibility when reasoning about the causal factors during <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis.</b> Such {{uncertainty is}} common when complicated systems interact with one another, {{and it is}} dangerous because it impairs <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> and thus increases the chance of overlooking unsafe situations. Uncertainty around causation thus needs to be managed well. Unfortunately, existing <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques tend to ignore unknown uncertainties, and system stakeholders rarely track known uncertainties well through the system lifecycle. In this paper, we outline an approach to managing epistemic uncertainty in existing <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques by focusing on known and unknown uncertainty. We have created a reference populated {{with a wide range}} of safety-critical causal relationships to recognise unknown uncertainty, and we have developed a model to systematically capture and track known uncertainty around such factors. We have also defined a process for using the reference and model to assess possible causal factors that are suspected during <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis.</b> To assess the applicability of our approach, we have analysed the widely-used MoDAF architectural model and determined that there is potential for our approach to identify additional causal factors that are not apparent from individual MoDAF views. We have also reviewed an existing safety assessment example (the ARP 4761 Aircraft System analysis) and determined that our approach could indeed be incorporated into that process. We have also integrated our approach into the STPA <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> technique to demonstrate its feasibility to incorporate into existing techniques. It is therefore plausible that our approach can increase safety assurance provided by <b>hazard</b> <b>analysis</b> in the face of epistemic uncertainty.
