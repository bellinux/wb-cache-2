Thomas' lawyers alleged that Page had essentially accused him of official misconduct, a felony. Page wrote in his column that Thomas had traded his vote on a disciplinary case in exchange for political support for his favored candidate in a local judicial race. The case was significant because it prompted an Illinois appellate court to establish a <b>judicial</b> <b>privilege</b> in Illinois, allowing judicial deliberations to be kept private, much like doctor-patient discussions.|$|E

40|$|Nikos Oikonomides  The <b>Judicial</b> <b>Privilege</b> of Nea Moni on Chios Emperor Constantine  IX Monomachos granted (1045) to {{the monastery}} of Nea Moni on Chios a {{judicial}} privilege: any {{action against the}} monastery should be brought to court {{in front of the}} imperial tribunal only (JGR I, 629 - 631). In the present article it is argued that this privilege {{has nothing to do with}} the western immunitas, because the privilege does not give the monastery any right to judge other people. The privilege is compared to the similar ones granted to the monasteries of Lavra (963 - 964) and Iviron (1079). And it is interpreted as an effort to protect the founders of Nea Moni, who were seemingly spiritual mysticists, from the monastic establishment of Constantinople, especially the cenobitic Stoudiou movement. In fact, as we learn from Psellos, the founders of Nea Moni were eventually accused and condemned of heresy by the imperial tribunal under empress Theodora (1055 - 56), but were later re-instated thanks to the support of Patriarch Michael Keroularios.  </p...|$|E

The fact, however, that it superseded these preexisting councils for this express purpose, and that the new tribunal (as it turned out to be) ignored the <b>judicial</b> <b>privileges</b> enshrined in such constitutional documents as the Joyeuses entrées of the ancient Duchy of Brabant (which Philip had affirmed on his accession to the ducal throne in 1556), shocked the constitutional conscience of the Regent, and the Dutch politicians.|$|R

50|$|Like {{many other}} small {{municipalities}} in Zeeland at the time, Vrijberge owed its municipal status {{to the existence}} of an estate with <b>judicial</b> <b>privileges.</b> After the introduction of the municipal system by the French, almost all of these estates became separate municipalities. However, if no one was willing {{to keep up with the}} legal costs of a municipality (taxes etc.), it was merged with a neighbouring town.Vrijberge came into existence in the 18th century after some previously flooded areas were again turned into habitable land, through the erection of dykes. It was through the management of these polders that Vrijberge gained its own small administration.The area, like most of Tholen, was flooded during the 1953 North Sea storm flood. Vrijberge, with less than 50 inhabitants, had by then already ceased to be of any importance. Since 1970 the whole island of Tholen is administered as a single municipality.|$|R
5000|$|From the 10th to the 11th centuries, {{the urban}} {{development}} of the country expanded (particularly on the northern coasts): new ports appeared and dukes and counts encouraged and created new towns.

In the late 11th century, [...] "communes", governing assemblies, began to develop in towns. [...] Starting sporadically in the late 10th, and increasingly in the 12th century, many towns and villages were able to gain economic, social or <b>judicial</b> <b>privileges</b> and franchises from their lords (exemptions from tolls and dues, rights to clear land or hold fairs, some judicial or administrative independence, etc.). [...] The seigneurial reaction to expanding urbanism and enfranchisement was mixed; some lords fought against the changes, but some lords gained financial and political advantages from the communal movement and growing trade.|$|R

5000|$|In 1141-42 the viguier Aimon, at {{the head}} of the bourgeoisie, led a revolt against William and {{expelled}} him from the town. Alfonso Jordan, the Count of Toulouse, [...] "attempted to fish in troubled waters", receiving a strong rebuke from Pope Anacletus II, with whom William VI had a close relationship bordering on an outright alliance. Despite Papal support for William, the bishop refused to intervene against the viguier, but with Genoese and Aragonese backing he succeeded in taking back the town after a lengthy siege in 1143, to which Genoa contributed four galleys. The Chronique Romane highlights the role of Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona and the siege-induced famine in the surrender of the town:In the year one thousand, one hundred and forty-one, the men of Montpellier ejected lord William of Montpellier from the city, and the lord went to Lattes, and the battle endured two years. The count of Barcelona returned to him William the city through a siege. And at that time ten beans were woth one denarius. (En lan de M et C et XLI, giteron los homes de Montpellier en Guillem de Montpellier de la vila, et anet sen a Latas, e duret la batalla II ans: el coms de Barsalona rendet li la villa per assetge: et adones valian X favas 1 d.)Immediately William set about to destroy the power of the viguier. He razed their castle within the town walls and revoked their <b>judicial</b> <b>privileges</b> and their separate court. With Aragonese assistance he initiated new construction on his family's castle in the north of the town. This phase of improvement was not ended until 1152. These moves, and probable the conciliation of the disaffected bourgeoisie, were successful in removing the hereditary viguiers, the Aimons, from a place of influence.|$|R

6000|$|This mode strikes, as we apprehend, at {{the vital}} {{privileges}} of the House. For, {{with the single}} exception of the first question put to the Judges in 1788, the case being stated, the questions are raised directly, specifically, and by name, on those privileges: that is, What evidence is it competent for the Managers of the House of Commons to produce? We conceive {{that it was not}} proper, nor justified by a single precedent, to refer to the Judges of the inferior courts any question, and still less for them to decide in their answer, of what is or is not competent for the House of Commons, or for any committee acting under their authority, to do or not to do, in any instance or respect whatsoever. This new and unheard-of course can have no other effect than to subject to the discretion of the Judges the Law of Parliament and the privileges of the House of Commons, and in a great measure the <b>judicial</b> <b>privileges</b> of the Peers themselves: any intermeddling in which on their part we conceive to be a dangerous and unwarrantable assumption of power. It is contrary to what has been declared by Lord Coke himself, in a passage before quoted, to be the duty of the Judges,--and to what the Judges of former times have confessed to be their duty, on occasions to which he refers in the time of Henry VI. And we are of opinion that the conduct of those sages of the law, and others their successors, who have been thus diffident and cautious in giving their opinions upon matters concerning Parliament, and particularly on the privileges of the House of Commons, was laudable in the example, and ought to be followed: particularly the principles upon which the Judges declined to give their opinions in the year 1614. It appears by the Journals of the Lords, that a question concerning the law relative to impositions having been put to the Judges, the proceeding was as follows. [...] "Whether the Lords the Judges shall be heard deliver their opinion touching the point of impositions, before further consideration be had of answer to be returned to the lower House concerning the message from them lately received. Whereupon the number of the Lords requiring to hear the Judges' opinions by saying 'Content' exceeding the others which said 'Non Content,' the Lords the Judges, so desiring, were permitted to withdraw themselves into the Lord Chancellor's private rooms, where having remained awhile and advised together, they returned into the House, and, having taken their places, and standing discovered, did, by the mouth of the Lord Chief-Justice of the King's Bench, humbly desire to be forborne at this time, in this place, to deliver any opinion in this case, for many weighty and important reasons, which his Lordship delivered with great gravity and eloquence; concluding that himself and his brethren are upon particulars in judicial course to speak and judge between the King's Majesty and his people, and likewise between his Highness's subjects, and in no case to be disputants on any side." ...|$|R
60|$|This last {{cause of}} the number of sitting days your Committee {{considers}} as far more important than all the rest. The questions upon the admissibility of evidence, the manner in which these questions were stated and were decided, the modes of proceeding, the great uncertainty of the principle upon which evidence in that court is to be admitted or rejected,--all these appear to your Committee materially to affect the constitution of the House of Peers as a court of judicature, as well as its powers, and the purposes it was intended to answer in the state. The Peers have a valuable interest in the conservation of their own lawful privileges. But this interest is not confined to the Lords. The Commons ought to partake in the advantage of the <b>judicial</b> rights and <b>privileges</b> of that high court. Courts are made for the suitors, and not the suitors for the court. The conservation of all other parts of the law, the whole indeed of the rights and liberties of the subject, ultimately depends upon the preservation of the Law of Parliament in its original force and authority.|$|R
5000|$|The Captains were agents {{named by}} the Dontário, and after 1495, by the Crown, to a {{lifetime}} title that was passed down by the [...] "legitimate male heirs". As administrators, the Captains enjoyed various <b>judicial</b> and economic <b>privileges</b> that provided an incentive to settle and develop their captaincies. They {{had the authority to}} administer sentences, with the exception of those involving penalties of death or mutilation. Economically, they had the exclusive authority to mill, bake bread and sell salt, in addition to their entitlement to receive rent paid to the King for lands, fees and taxes due. In addition, they could receive a tithe (the tenth portion) paid to the captaincy directly. In addition to the regalia of office, the captains-major would hold title to the best parcels of lands and be able to contract renters to the donatárias (lands of the Donatários), {{in the name of the}} crown. Many of the donatários were hereditary, with a few exceptions, referred in the Salic Laws (Leis Sálicas) of the time; these laws regulated all aspects of life, including crime, taxation, indemnity, and female inheritance.

40|$|Using as data some appellate courts’reviews of {{projects}} to maintain moral order in the city, this article shows that an analysis of legal knowledge production that is (a) dynamic and that (b) refuses to treat people and texts as totally different entities, one studied by social scientists and the other studied by lawyers, can tell us much about such familiar but seldom theorized legal manouvres as judicial review and constitutional challenges. Standing back somewhat from {{the content of the}} various claims (about urban vices, in our case studies), I focus instead on the dynamics of knowledge – the ways in which knowledge claims circulate and get transformed as they proceed through various legal, and para-legal, stages. Choosing to analyze the dynamics rather than the content of knowledge is inspired by Actor Network Theory, and Bruno Latour’s work in particular: but it also reflects the fact that <b>judicial</b> review also <b>privileges</b> process and form and tends to avoid making judgements about the content of impugned laws or ordinance. In addition, Actor Network Theory also insists that all components of a knowledge network, including things and texts, be treated as ‘actors’: this can help to take sociolegal work beyond the dichotomy of studying law in the books (texts) vs. law in action (humans) ...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{tradeoff}} {{analysis is}} in the process of transforming the practice of regulation. Its core idea is simple and intuitively appealing: Regulations undertaken to minimize or eliminate certain health risks often have the perverse effect of promoting other risks. A serious analysis of the impact of a regulation should pay attention not only to its primary effects in reducing the so-called target risk, but also to the secondary effects of the regulation in bringing about 2 ̆ 2 ancillary risks. 2 ̆ 2 In this way, risk tradeoff analysis promises a more rational technique for the evaluation of regulation. Risk tradeoff analysis, however, focuses exclusively on the negative secondary effects of risk regulation, but systematically ignores the phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 ancillary benefits, 2 ̆ 2 the reductions in risk that take place in addition to [...] and as a direct or indirect result of [...] reductions in the target risk. The resulting conclusions are therefore consistently biased against regulation. This methodological bias is, in turn, reinforced by an institutional bias that emerges when risk tradeoff analysis is applied in the administrative state. Agency inattention to ancillary effects gives rise to iterative processes of administrative oversight and <b>judicial</b> review that <b>privilege</b> the opponents of regulation. This Article sheds light on these biases and proposes a solution: ancillary benefit analysis. This technique would direct the attention of administrative decisionmakers to the positive byproducts of regulation designed to promote health, safety, and the environment. At a time when risk tradeoff analysis enjoys ever-growing support in the courts and the academy, this Article proposes an approach through which to counteract its one-sidedness...|$|R
40|$|As one {{surveys the}} vast and ever-changing {{landscape}} {{of law and}} litigation, few things stand out as so unanimously exalted and carefully guarded as the privilege protecting attorney-client communications. Yet there is today a surprising lack of uniformity and predictability in the reasoning by which New York courts determine whether a communication made by in-house counsel to its corporate client will – or will not – enjoy the protection of that privilege. Rather than follow a single and predictable analysis to resolve the question, New York courts have oscillated between one line of decisions focusing primarily on {{the purpose of the}} communication, and another in which the primary focus is on content. This variability has created a <b>judicial</b> landscape where <b>privilege</b> disputes virtually identical on the facts have entirely different outcomes. Exacerbating this problem is the large number of non-legal functions that today’s in-house counsel perform for their corporate clients. In the execution of these non-legal duties, in-house counsel often send communications that are a mix of legal and business advice and thus fall into a gray area of the law in regards to privilege. Without any statutory guidance to suggest otherwise, judges must then meticulously parse through the communications at issue and make a case-by-case determination as to whether the communication is mostly legal in nature, and thus business matters, and therefore freely discoverable by opposing counsel. Two simple solutions exist that can help restore order and predictability on this issue in New York. By adopting a unified method of analysis that includes consideration of both purpose and content, and by creating a signal that explicitly denotes privileged communication between in-house counsel and client, New York State courts can more accurately and efficiently adjudicate this issue, and bring some much needed uniformity and predictability to this area of the law...|$|R
