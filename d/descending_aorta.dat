40|$|AbstractMobile luminal {{thrombus}} of the <b>descending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> is {{an unusual}} finding in patients with peripheral embolization. The diagnosis is best made with transesophageal echography (TEE). Traditionally, systemic anticoagulation and selective surgical thrombectomy are standard treatment. We present a case report of recurrent mobile thrombus despite surgical thrombectomy and systemic anticoagulation. We treated it with endovascular exclusion of a <b>descending</b> thoracic <b>aorta</b> emboligenic lesion with an endoluminal stent graft, using simultaneous TEE and fluoroscopic intraoperative guidance. The patient remains symptom-free 9 months after stent-graft implantation.

25|$|In {{the pelvis}} area, {{at the level}} of the last lumbar vertebra, the {{abdominal}} aorta, a continuation the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> splits into a pair of common iliac arteries.

25|$|Access is {{gained through}} a left lateral {{thoracotomy}} incision below the sixth rib. The inferior mediastinum {{is exposed to}} the level of the anterior aspect of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta.</b> All of the shunting veins that direct blood to the collateral veins from the esophagus are ligated, taking special consideration to preserving the extraesophageal systemic venous collaterals (azygous veins). Usually between 30-50 shunting veins are present. Once devascularization is complete, the esophagus is clamped in two areas with esophageal clamps, and esophageal transection is done at the level of the diaphragm. The anterior muscular and mucosal layers are divided, but the posterior layer is left intact. Sutures are then placed and the divided varices are occluded. The muscle layer is then reattached. A nasogastric tube is left in situ, and the mediastinum is closed.|$|E

2500|$|Between 5% and 10% {{of those}} born with Turner {{syndrome}} have coarctation of the aorta, a congenital narrowing of the <b>descending</b> <b>aorta,</b> usually just distal to {{the origin of}} the left subclavian artery (the artery that branches off the arch of the aorta to the left arm) and opposite to the duct (and so termed [...] "juxtaductal"). Estimates of the prevalence of this malformation in patients with Turner syndrome range from 6.9 to 12.5%. A coarctation of the aorta in a female is suggestive of Turner syndrome and suggests the need for further tests, such as a karyotype.|$|E
