5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E

25|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>by</b> {{low-energy}} cosmic rays: The first mechanism {{proposed for}} heating the ISM was <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> low-energy cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are an efficient heating source able to penetrate {{in the depths}} of molecular clouds. Cosmic rays transfer energy to gas through both ionization and excitation and to free electrons through Coulomb interactions. Low-energy cosmic rays (a few MeV) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy cosmic rays.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} power {{required}} to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated as the difference between coronal radiative losses and <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> thermal conduction toward the chromosphere through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's chromosphere, or 1/40000 {{of the amount of}} light energy that escapes the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of home <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> multiplying the local cost per kilowatt hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour 1.5×12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel it may be useful to convert kilowatt hours to BTUs: 1.5kWh × 3412.142=5118 BTU.|$|E

In 1970, only 31% of homes had central <b>heating.</b> <b>By</b> 2003 it had been installed in 92% of British homes, leading in turn to {{a rise in the}} average temperature within them (from 12.1°C to 18.20°C). Even in homes with central heating, average temperatures rose 4.55°C during this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{assumption}} was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers. In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the steam drum to the water drum. These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{generated}} {{has other}} uses besides power generation. In nuclear ships and submarines, the steam is fed through a steam turbine {{connected to a}} set of speed reduction gears to a shaft used for propulsion. Direct mechanical action by expansion of the steam can be used for a steam-powered aircraft catapult or similar applications. District <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> the steam is used in some countries and direct heating is applied to internal plant applications.|$|E
25|$|Because Tethys lacks {{substantial}} rock content, the <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> {{decay of}} radioactive elements {{is unlikely to}} have {{played a significant role}} in its further evolution. This also means that Tethys may have never experienced any significant melting unless its interior was heated by tides. They may have occurred, for instance, during the passage of Tethys through an orbital resonance with Dione or some other moon. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Tethys is very limited.|$|E

5000|$|Diathermancy (from [...] "dia" [...] {{through and}} [...] "thermē" [...] heat) is the {{property}} of some fluids that allows rays of light through them without itself being heated. A diathermanous fluid is thus [...] "permeable" [...] <b>by</b> <b>heat.).</b> Diathermancy was first described by German physicist and chemist Heinrich Magnus in the 1800s. Atmospheric air is diathermanous; therefore, air is not <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> sunshine, but <b>by</b> long wave <b>heat</b> reflected <b>by</b> soil, and especially, water on the Earth surface. Water, on the contrary, is not diathermanous, and it is <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> sunshine directly.|$|R

25|$|Temperature {{must also}} be {{accounted}} for because the air pump will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the test piece plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the air pump after the metering element so that <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> the air pump is not as large a concern.|$|E
25|$|It {{was already}} {{recognised}} that a water-tube boiler {{relied on a}} continuous flow through the water-tubes, and that this must be by a thermosyphon effect rather than requiring an impractical pump. Forced-circulation boilers with pumps, such as the Velox, would not appear for another thirty years and even then they would be initially unreliable. The assumption was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers.|$|E
25|$|This natural {{ventilation}} {{process can be}} augmented by a solar chimney. The chimney has {{to be higher than}} the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a glazed surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface {{is more important than the}} diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the prevailing wind.|$|E
