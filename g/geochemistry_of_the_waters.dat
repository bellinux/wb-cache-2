40|$|ABSTRACT: Geochemical {{sampling}} of groundwater {{may be an}} effective tool in exploring for Au deposits in areas of transported overburden. However, to use hydrogeochemistry effectively, {{we need to understand}} which elements are useful pathfinders and how their distribution patterns are affected by groundwater flow and geochemistry, especially in areas that have hypersaline groundwater. A hydrogeo-chemical survey was completed over the strongly Au-endowed St. Ives area of the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Extensive geochemical and hydrogeological data were measured from 80 holes drilled on a kilometre-spaced grid. A numerical model was developed to quantify the groundwater flow regime in the study area. Also, hydrogeological data in combination with the <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> were used to identify a complex flow regime adjacent to Lake Lefroy, a playa lake in the area. Regional brine flows towards the salt lake, evaporation occurs and hypersaline (playa) brines are formed that sink and flow away from Lake Lefroy and beneath the regional brines. Density-driven, convective mixing of these two brines is responsible for forming a zone of brines with transitional compositions located near the edge o...|$|E

B concentrations cover a wide range from 329 to 3920 µM (0. 8 - 9. 3 * seawater) and vary isotopically from + 20 to + 46 per mil (relative to SRM 951). In general, B concentrations increase more or less steadily with depth. At both sites, the B enrichment and isotopic changes seem {{to be related to}} a deep fluid influence, possibly coupled with alteration of volcanic products. Silica diagenesis does not affect the B <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> as is evident from intact diatom tests and high opal-A contents throughout the holes. The B enrichment is more pronounced at Site 1150 in the seismic portion of the forearc. Here, a large positive anomaly in d 11 B values is observed, which corresponds with abundant fracturing and two prominent shear zones. At about the same depth range at Site 1151, the d 11 B values show a negative shift, attesting to an enrichment in 10 B in the fluid as a result of B desorption from clay due to burial and tectonic stress. We conclude that B release from clay minerals is the major contributor to pore fluid anomalies, and that fluid flow through permeable out-of-sequence thrust (like the shear zones at Site 1150) may be an efficient mechanism for B backflux from the forearc into the hydrosphere...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} three years, {{one of the longest}} quartz-sandstone caves, Imawarì Yeuta, has been {{explored}} in the Precambrian rocks of the Auyan Tepui massif in Venezuela. The uniqueness of this quartz-sandstone cave resides in its great age (estimated over 30 Ma) and its complete isolation from anthropogenic activities. Therefore, subsurface ecosystems might have been preserved from contamination and possible subsequent alteration. The cave contains a high level of microbial activity as demonstrated by the presence of silica stromatolite-like speleothems, biologically mediated sulphate-phosphate deposits and lakes covered by patinas of violaceous or other colourful biofilms. The high diversity of the environments, in terms of mineralogical substrate and <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> suggests that niche-differentiation of the microbial communities could be mainly controlled by the specific chemical characteristics of each site rather than by light attenuation, i. e., the distance from the entrances of the cave toward the dark zones. To investigate this possibility, we characterised the microbial community composition in 17 samples collected during the expeditions of 2014 and 2016 to the cave system. In particular, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach was performed by using Illumina MiSeq technology targeting the 16 S rRNA gene. The acquired data have then been correlated with geochemical (water pH, EC, major and minor elements) and mineralogical (predominant and secondary minerals) information from each sampling site.

The major dissolved ion concentrations, alkalinity (TAlk), SiO 2, trace element concentrations, and Sr isotope contents in the water were determined between April 2009 and January 2010. In addition, the isotopic values of oxygen and hydrogen were determined between 2011 and 2013.

40|$|Rare earth element and yttrium (REE+Y) {{concentrations}} were determined in 49 Late Devonian reefal carbonates from the Lennard Shelf, Canning Basin, Western Australia. Shale-normalized (SN) REE+Y {{patterns of the}} Late Devonian samples display features consistent with the geochemistry of well-oxygenated, shallow seawater. A variety of different ancient limestone components, including microbialites, some skeletal carbonates (stromatoporoids), and cements, record seawater-like REE+Y signatures. Contamination associated with phosphate, Fe-oxides and shale was tested quantitatively, and can be discounted {{as the source of}} the REE+Y patterns. Co-occurring carbonate components that presumably precipitated from the same seawater have different relative REE concentrations, but consistent REE+Y patterns. Clean Devonian early marine cements (n = 3) display REE+Y signatures most like that of modern open ocean seawater and the highest Y/Ho ratios (e. g., 59) and greatest light REE (LREE) depletion (average Nd-SN/Yb-SN = 0. 413, SD = 0. 076). However, synsedimentary cements have the lowest REE concentrations (e. g., 405 ppb). Non-contaminated Devonian microbialite samples containing a mixture of the calcimicrobe Renalcis and micritic thrombolite aggregates in early marine cement (n = 11) have the highest relative REE concentrations of tested carbonates (average total REE = 11. 3 ppm). Stromatoporoid skeletons, unlike modern corals, algae and molluscs, also contain well-developed, seawater-like REE patterns. Samples from an estuarine fringing reef have very different REE+Y patterns with LREE enrichment (Nd-SN/Yb-SN > 1), possibly reflecting inclusion of estuarine colloidal material that contained preferentially scavenged LREE from a nearby riverine input source. Hence, Devonian limestones provide a proxy for marine REE geochemistry and allow the differentiation of co-occurring water masses on the ancient Lennard Shelf. Although appropriate partition coefficients for quantification of Devonian seawater REE concentrations from out data are unknown, hypothetical Devonian Canning Basin seawater REE patterns were obtained with coefficients derived from modern natural proxies and experimental values. Resulting Devonian seawater patterns are slightly enriched in LREE compared to most modem seawaters and suggest higher overall REE concentrations, but are very similar to seawaters from regions with high terrigenous inputs. Our results suggest that most limestones should record important aspects of the REE <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> in which they precipitated, provided they are relatively free of terrigenous contamination and major diagenetic alteration from fluids with high, non-seawater-like REE contents. Hence, we expect that many other ancient limestones will serve as seawater REE proxies, and thereby provide information on paleoceanography, paleogeography and geochemical evolution of the oceans.

The seams dip basinward, and are gently folded along strike into a syncline and anticline, which is separated by a large normal fault that marks a boundary between production domains. For one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target seams, a master seam split occurs, resulting in elevated mineral matter content and separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seam reservoir. A number of smaller normal faults also occur across the anticline. The high production domain occurs north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault where gas reservoir size is greater due to higher gas contents in the syncline combined with greater net coal for both seams; the moderate gas production domain occurs south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault where gas contents are slightly lower across <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticline. Little communication occurs between these two distinct areas, and this compartmentalization was established by examining <b>the</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and gas. Stable isotope analysis and water quality tests, including anions, cations and trace elements, were conducted on <b>water</b> samples from <b>the</b> two producing coal seams across the study field to assess zones of recharge, water mixing and pathways. The stable isotope analysis showed that production waters with higher δD and δ 18 O compositions were associated with areas of higher water production and shallower depths. Lower δD and δ 18 O compositions, and in particular those that lie above the GWL on the δD vs δ 18 O graph are generally associated with low water production and high gas production. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> quality analysis showed that waters with lower sodicity and bicarbonate concentrations were associated with high water production and waters with higher sodicity and bicarbonate concentrations were associated with high gas production. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> higher bicarbonate concentrations and lower δD and δ 18 O compositions in the high gas production domain suggests that biogenic gas could have been generated in this area, and is confirmed by <b>the</b> isotopic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methane. Stable isotope and composition analyses were undertaken on gas samples collected from selected wells in the study field. Gas compositions were consistent across the field with all CH 4 composition measurements over 95 % and CO 2 compositions 1. 6 % or less. The results from the stable isotope analysis showed that biogenic gas was produced at shallow depths, and <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> thermogenic to biogenic CH 4 increased with depth. Wells with the highest gas production have a well depth of between 200 m and 300 m, produce gas that {{is a mixture of}} biogenic and thermogenic gas and have larger CO 2 -CH 4 carbon isotopic fractionations from 60. 8 ‰ to 62. 9 ‰.

Some {{of them are}} so enormous that they are rare worldwide, but their activities were previously poorly known. We collected three gravity-piston cores from this pockmark field, one (C 9) from outside, but in close proximity to, a giant pockmark {{and the other two}} (C 14 and C 19) from inside two giant pockmarks. <b>The</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pore <b>waters,</b> including SO 42 -, K+, Ca- 2 +, Mg 2 +, Sr 2 +, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), delta C- 13 (DIC) values, and delta S- 34 values of sulfate, was analyzed to elucidate the biogeochemical processes associated with sulfate consumption and to evaluate the current pockmark activity. The sulfate concentration depth profiles of C 9 and C 19 are predominantly in response to organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR), whereas <b>the</b> sulfate concentrations <b>of</b> C 14 exhibit three zones of different concentration gradients resulting from varying proportions of contributions from OSR and anaerobic oxidation <b>of</b> methane (AOM). <b>The</b> estimated lower sulfur isotope fractionation factor suggests a higher microbial sulfate reduction rate in C 14 than in C 9 as a possible consequence of AOM. Based on the sulfate concentration gradient of C 14 below 3. 7 mbsf, <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulfate methane interface (SMI) and the methane diffusive flux in C 14 are calculated to be similar to 14. 3 mbsf and similar to 0. 0144 mol m(- 2) yr(- 1), respectively. The pore-water Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca weight ratios suggest that high Mg-calcite is in equilibrium with respect to pore water or has recently precipitated from pore water in C 14. The delta C- 13 (DIC) values of C 9 and C 19 are derived from a binary mixture of delta C- 13 from organic matter and of delta C- 13 (DIC) from bottom water, while DIC from bottom water, OSR, and AOM, concomitant with C- 13 -enriched DIC from below the SMI possibly all contribute to the DIC pool below 0. 66 mbsf in C 14. <b>The</b> integrated analysis <b>of</b> pore water <b>geochemistry</b> implies that the pockmark from which C 19 was collected may be inactive while the pockmark from which C 14 was obtained may currently be sluggish in activity with methane-bearing fluid weakly seeping from subsurface sediments.

40|$|Serpentinite seamounts in the Mariana forearc {{have been}} {{explained}} as diapirs {{rising from the}} Benioff zone. This hypothesis predicts that the serpentinites should have low strengths as well as low densities relative to the surrounding rocks. Drilling during Leg 125 showed that the materials forming Conical Seamount in the Mariana forearc and Torishima Forearc Seamount in the Izu-Bonin forearc are water-charged serpentinite muds of density < 2 g/cm** 3. Wykeham-Farrance torsion-vane tests showed that they are plastic solids with a rheology that bears many similarities to the idealized Cam clay soil model and is well described by critical-state soil mechanics. The serpentinite muds have ultimate strengths of 1. 3 to 273. 7 kPa and yield strengths of approximately 1. 0 to 50 kPa. These muds thus are orders of magnitude weaker than salt and are, in fact, comparable in density and strength to common deep-sea clay muds. Such weak and low-density materials easily become diapiric. Serpentinite muds from <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> Conical Seamount are weaker and more ductile than those on its flanks or on Torishima Forearc Seamount. Moreover, the summit muds do not contain the pronounced pure- and simple-shear fabrics that characterize those on the seamount flanks. The seamounts are morphologically similar to shield volcanoes, and anastomosing serpentinite debris flows descending from their summits are similar in map view to pahoehoe flows. These morphologic features, together with <b>the</b> physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muds and their similarities to other oceanic muds and <b>the</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrained <b>waters,</b> suggest that many forearc serpentinite seamounts are gigantic (10 - 20 km wide, 1. 5 - 2. 0 km high) mud volcanoes that formed by <b>the</b> eruption <b>of</b> highly liquid serpentinite muds. Torishima Forearc Seamount, which is blanketed by more ìnormalî pelagic/volcaniclastic sediment, has probably been inactive since the Miocene. Conical Seamount, which seems to consist entirely of serpentinite mud and is venting fresh water of unusual chemistry from its summit, is presently active. Muds from <b>the</b> flanks <b>of</b> Conical Seamount are stronger and more brittle than those from the summit site, and muds from Torishima Forearc Seamount are stronger yet; {{this suggests that the}} serpentinite debris flows are compacted and dewatered as they mature. The shear fabrics probably result from downslope creep and flow, but may also be inherited...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal {{activity}} {{occurs in}} all ocean basins, releasing {{high concentrations of}} key trace elements and isotopes (TEI) into the oceans. Importantly, <b>the</b> calculated rate <b>of</b> entrainment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire ocean volume through turbulently mixing buoyant hydrothermal plumes is so vigorous as to be {{comparable to that of}} deep-ocean thermohaline circulation. Consequently, biogeochemical processes active within deep ocean hydrothermal plumes have long been known to have the potential to impact global scale biogeochemical cycles. More recently, new results from GEOTRACES have revealed that plumes rich in dissolved Fe, an important micronutrient that is limiting to productivity in some areas, are widespread above mid-ocean ridges and extend out into the deep ocean interior. While Fe is only one element among <b>the</b> full suite <b>of</b> TEIs of interest to GEOTRACES, these preliminary results are important because they illustrate how inputs from seafloor venting might impact the global biogeochemical budgets of many other TEIs. To determine <b>the</b> global impact <b>of</b> seafloor venting, however, requires two key questions to be addressed: (a) What processes are active close to vent-sites that regulate the initial high temperature hydrothermal fluxes for <b>the</b> full suite <b>of</b> TEIs that are dispersed through non-buoyant hydrothermal plumes? (b) How do those processes vary, globally, in response to changing geologic settings at the seafloor and/or <b>the</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying ocean <b>water?</b> In this paper, we review key findings from recent work in this realm, highlight a series of key hypotheses arising from that research and propose a series of new GEOTRACES modelling, section and process studies that could be implemented, nationally and internationally, to address these issues...|$|R

40|$|A avaliação geoquímica da bacia de drenagem do Rio Mampituba foi realizada através da aplicação de geoindicadores aliada ao uso dos isótopos de Sr e Pb como traçadores de fontes e processos. O presente estudo realizou uma investigação preliminar da distribuição espacial e sazonal de geoindicadores como a geoquímica das águas superficiais, dos solos e dos sedimentos de fundo para determinar as características naturais da bacia de drenagem. A utilização de ferramentas isotópicas permitiu traçar as principais fontes de proveniência do {{material}} presente nas águas. A geoquímica das águas superficiais revelou que o Rio Mampituba apresenta águas bicarbonatadas sódicas. Porém, na região do curso inferior, sob forte influência marinha devido à variação das marés, as águas assumem características cloretadas sódicas, temporariamente. A geoquímica dos solos e sedimentos de fundo revelaram que estes materiais sofreram já um processo de intemperismo químico de moderado a intenso, e são emriquecidos principalmente em Ti, Fe, Zn e Cu. A aplicação de isótopos de Sr através da razão 87 Sr/ 86 Sr nas águas, cujos valores variaram entre 0, 7091 a 0, 7131, revelaram que o material em suspensão apresenta a mesma fonte geoquímica, dependendo principalmente do intemperismo das rochas e escoamento dos solos, porém sofrendo uma forte influência das águas marinhas na regiao do curso inferior devido a variação das marés. Esta última é responsável pelos processos de homogeneização da razão isotópica de Sr para as águas do curso inferior da bacia. A aplicação dos isótopos de Sr nos solos e sedimentos de fundo, cujos valores estão dentro do intervalo de 0, 7142 a 0, 721, comprovam a natureza geoquímica oriunda dos basaltos e riolitos ocorrentes nas cabeceiras da bacia, além de providenciar razões isotópicas para ajudar a compôr o background natural da região. A aplicação de isótopos de Pb foram concordantes com os resultados obtidos para Sr. O cruzamento de ambos sistemas isotópicos, Sr x Pb, permitiu refinar os processos de erosão dentro da bacia, revelando que além das fontes geoquímicas naturais, uma terceira fonte poderia estar inlfuenciando a geoquímica dos solos e sedimentos de fundo da bacia. <b>The</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{drainage basin}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mampituba River, in south Brazil, was evaluated by a coupled study <b>of</b> geoindicators and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Sr and Pb isotopes as tracers for sources and processes. This study performed a preliminary investigation of spatial and seasonal distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>waters,</b> soils and bed sediments {{in order to}} determine <b>the</b> natural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drainage basin. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> isotopic tools allowed us to trace <b>the</b> major sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspended material in <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>geochemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>waters</b> revealed that <b>the</b> Mampituba River has sodic bicarbonated waters, although sea level variations caused by tides and atmospheric conditions can also play significant roles in the lower course and render <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> temporarily salty and sodic chlorinated. The CIA (chemical index of alteration) value of soil and bed sediments confirms that the Mampituba basin has undergone moderate to intense silicate weathering. <b>The</b> geochemical assessment <b>of</b> soils and bed sediments was carried out using enrichment factor, which showed that Ti, Fe, Zn and Cu are enriched. The Sr isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in surface waters range from 0. 709 to 0. 7131. This difference can be attributed to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> volcanic rocks, which have a higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> marine <b>waters</b> in <b>the</b> study area. The first factor controlling <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> Sr isotope ratios is the bedrock distributed around the overall basin. Regional variation in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value shows that it is higher in the western basin, where volcanic rocks are distributed, and lower in the river mouth, under strong tidal influence.
