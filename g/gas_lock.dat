A new high-velocity anti-tank rifle grenade called the Mecar ENERGA (dubbed the M28 in US Army service) was soon issued. However, its grenade launcher (dubbed the T119) had the same problems as the original M7 launcher and the M28 was inaccurate when launched from the M7A2. The M7A2 launcher was simply redesigned with a longer tube to fire the improved grenades and could be used with either the [...] "flat edge" [...] or [...] "high hump" [...] lock. After the war (from early 1956 to late 1959) it could be fitted with a leaf-sight that was calibrated for use with the M28.

If {{the ground in}} which the pipe is laid has high points - such as Hi1, 2 etc. and low points between them such as Lo1, 2 etc., then if the pipe is filled from the top, and was empty, the pipe fills OK as far as Hi1. If the water flow velocity is below the rising velocity of air bubbles ref, then water trickles down to the low point Lo2 and traps the remaining air between Hi1 and Lo2. As more water flows down, the upward leg Lo2 to Hi2 fills up. This exerts a pressure on the trapped air of either H2 m of water (WG = water gauge) or H1, whichever is less. If H2 is greater than H1, {{then you have a}} full air lock, and the water level in the up leg Lo2 to Hi2 stops at H1 and no further water can flow. If H1 is greater than H2, then some water can flow, but the full pipe hydraulic head H3 will not be reached and so flow is much less than expected. If there are further undulations, then the back pressure effects add together. Obviously long pipelines over fairly level, but undulating land, are bound to have many such high and low points.

40|$|Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) {{are widely}} {{being used in}} {{upstream}} oil production. To better understand the ESP pump?s behavior, two different ESPs, MVP-G 470 and ESP-WJE 1000, manufactured by Baker Hughes company have been studied experimentally and numerically to determine the pump and flow behavior in different operating conditions and for different working fluids. The MVP-G 470 is a multi-vane electrical submersible pump which {{has been designed to}} increase the gas handling capacity of typical multiphase ESPs up to 70 % gas volume fraction. Homogenized flow and finer bubbles produced by MVP pumps help the ESPs to delay the surging and <b>gas</b> <b>lock</b> condition to higher gas volume fractions and operate effectively. In this work, an experimental study on the performance of a 3 -stage MVP along with detail study on the performance of two stages of the pump are performed. Overall pump performance for different operating conditions such as different inlet pressure, inlet gas volume fraction, water flow rate and speeds are performed for a mixture of water and air. Detail study of a stage performance is done on the first and second stage of the pump using conductivity and pressure measurements accompanied by high speed visualization. The data obtained from these measurements is employed to relate stage head degradation to effective parameters on the pump performance. The ESP-WJE 1000 is a typical mixed flow ESP pump with a single vane rather than split-vane design used in MVPs. Numerical study on the erosion phenomena in this pump has been performed. The influence of key parameters on erosion in ESPs has been identified and a new model to predict the erosion rate at different pump locations has been introduced...|$|E
50|$|Often, gas is {{produced}} {{through the same}} perforations as the oil.

To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the standing valve inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.|$|R

When these cores were brought on board the ship, irregular degassing characteristics were observed, with the cores emitting very large quantities of gas, estimated to be ten times the volume of the core, that required special measures (i.e. drilling of vent holes in the core liner) to prevent complete disruption of core sediments. [...] Degassing the cores also took an abnormally long time of over two hours.

40|$|Spectroscopic {{analyses}} of gravity-sensitive line strengths give growing evidence towards {{an excess of}} low-mass stars in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). Such a scenario requires a bottom-heavy initial mass function (IMF). However, strong constraints can be imposed if we take into account galactic chemical enrichment. We extend the analysis of Weidner et al. and consider the functional form of bottom-heavy IMFs used in recent works, where the high-mass end slope is kept fixed to the Salpeter value, and a free parameter is introduced to describe the slope at stellar masses below some pivot mass scale (M<MP= 0. 5 Msun). We find that no such time-independent parameterisation is capable to reproduce the full set of constraints in the stellar populations of massive ETGs - resting {{on the assumption that}} the analysis of gravity-sensitive line strengths leads to a mass fraction at birth in stars with mass M< 0. 5 Msun above 60 %. Most notably, the large amount of metal-poor <b>gas</b> <b>locked</b> in low-mass stars during the early, strong phases of star formation results in average stellar metallicities [M/H]<- 0. 6, well below the solar value.

40|$|The {{presence}} of gas hydrates offshore New Zealand has been inferred from bottom simulating reflections (BSRs) {{for over two}} decades (Katz, 1981). BSRs are widespread on the Hikurangi margin east of the North Island and on the Fiordland margin southwest of the South Island. New Zealand’s largest conventional gas field may be depleted {{in a few years}} and hence, there is increasing interest in the resource potential of gas hydrates. Most of our studies are currently focusing on the Hikurangi margin, mainly because of its proximity to major population centers, making it attractive for possible future gas production. For this margin, we have performed first estimates of the resource potential in gas hydrates (Pecher and Henrys, 2003). Because of a paucity of adequate seismic data and lack of drilling and coring of gas hydrates, our estimates are highly uncertain. However, based on the distribution of BSRs, we were able to constrain the gas hydrate province to an area of about 50, 000 km 2 (Fig. 1).
