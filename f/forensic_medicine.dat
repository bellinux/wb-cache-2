5|$|Although {{interests}} in human anatomy {{had a long}} tradition in the Western world, a forensic book such as Song Ci's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro's book in the 17th century. There have been several modern books published about Song Ci's writing and translations of it into English. This includes W.A. Harland's Records of Washing away of Injuries (1855), Herbert Giles' The Hsi Yuan Lu, or Instructions to Coroners (1924), and Dr. Brian E. McKnight's The Washing Away of Wrongs: <b>Forensic</b> <b>Medicine</b> in Thirteenth-Century China (1981).|$|E
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} taken to the nearby town of Slatina for {{forensic}} examination on 17 December. Mackley contacted Croatian authorities and obtained permission to document the autopsies of the victims, but was denied access by authorities in Slatina. Mackley telephoned Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak asking him to intervene on his behalf, but the local police allegedly disobeyed Šušak. The special police was deployed to Slatina to enforce Šušak's order to cooperate, almost causing an armed clash over the issue. To settle matters, a team was sent to Slatina by Zagreb University's Institute for <b>Forensic</b> <b>Medicine</b> to perform autopsies, retrieve bodies and perform the rest of the procedures in Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, {{the twin}} villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, {{killing at least}} seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a {{statement}} in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of <b>Forensic</b> <b>Medicine</b> at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chlorine or cyanogen bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.|$|E
