5000|$|Dock {{plates and}} dock boards are simply metal ramps, {{bridging}} {{the gaps between}} dock and truck. [...] Dock plates are generally made out of aluminium whilst dock boards are generally made out of steel. Aluminium dock plates are thus more suitable for lighter loads, such as handcarts and dollies, whereas steel dock boards {{are more suitable for}} heavier motorized equipment such as fork lift trucks and electric pallet trucks. Another difference between dock plates and dock boards, in addition to their load-bearing capabilities, is their construction. Dock plates are simple flat plates, whereas dock boards have curbs, bolted or welded {{to the edge of the}} board. Run-off is prevented by a simple painted yellow strip along the edge of a <b>dock</b> <b>plate,</b> whereas it is the curbs (also generally painted yellow) that prevent run-off on dock boards; these curbs are also where the higher weight capacities of dock boards come from. Run-off is thus a significant risk on dock plates, since the yellow strip is not a particularly effective mechanism for preventing it.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} window blinds and {{curtains}} use a cord pull to open, close, raise, and lower them. Some types of ladders like the extension ladder and attic ladder {{can have a}} pullstring that pulls it down from the ceiling. A <b>dock</b> <b>plate</b> can use a pullchain to move it. Some gates have a pullstring on its latch. A pull switch uses a chain or string to actuate a switch, commonly used in lighting and ceiling fans. Modern flush toilets use a pullchain attached to a lever that lifts the plunger to release water into the toilet bowl. The photoplayer uses pullchains to generate sound effects for silent films. Pre-1990s North American diesel locomotive train horns used a lever or pull cord to actuate an air valve. Older steam whistles were almost always actuated with a pull cord. A train's emergency brake can be a cord or chain that will stop the train when pulled. Older transit buses and trams/trolleys have a pullcord that a passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop. The Jaguar XK120 sports car's doors have no external handles so it uses an interior pullcord instead. Some grandfather clocks have a pullchain to raise the weights in order to wind the clock's gears. A lifejacket has a pullcord used to inflate it.|$|E
5000|$|Dock {{levelers}} {{are more}} expensive devices than the comparatively light-weight <b>dock</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>dock</b> boards. The {{most common form of}} dock leveler is the recessed, or pit, dock leveler. As the name suggests, this type of leveler is contained in a recess, or pit, beneath the dock door and floor surface. Dock levelers are stronger than <b>dock</b> <b>plates</b> and have similar ranges to dock boards, making them suitable not only for motorized fork lift trucks but also for master conveyors (for which neither <b>dock</b> <b>plates</b> or <b>dock</b> boards are suitable). Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of dock levelers and for safety components on dock levelers. NOTE: edge of dock levelers have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard dock heights.|$|R
50|$|Dock {{levelers}} {{and lifts}} are generally permanent fixtures at each {{door of a}} <b>dock.</b> <b>Dock</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>dock</b> boards are generally, by contrast, portable, and not fixed either to dock or truck.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>dock</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>dock</b> boards have {{a diamond}} pattern {{embossed}} onto their upper surfaces, to prevent wheel slip as carts and vehicles travel {{up and down}} the incline. Similarly, they both have locking T-bar legs that extend down into the gap between truck and dock, to secure them. They are both portable. But dock boards are heavier than <b>dock</b> <b>plates.</b> The latter may be carried by hand, and are generally fitted with handles for doing so. The former usually require a fork lift in order to place and remove them, and are generally fitted with either loops or chains, used for attaching the dock board to the forks of the fork lift.|$|R
50|$|Dock {{levelers}} (and indeed <b>dock</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>dock</b> boards) {{are used}} where a building has a truck-level door, i.e. a {{door with a}} floor level roughly {{at the same height}} as the floor of the truck's trailer. Some buildings only have drive-in doors, i.e. doors at the same level as the ground outside of the building, suitable for driving directly into the building.|$|R
50|$|In a loading dock, {{one problem}} to {{overcome}} {{is the problem}} of bridging the gap between a truck and the dock or warehouse floor. Not all trucks are the same height, and the height of the trailer floor within a truck can vary according to how heavily the truck is laden. Thus there is not only a gap to bridge but a height difference to overcome. Various devices are employed in order to achieve this: <b>dock</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>dock</b> levelers, dock boards, and various forms of lift. These devices vary in construction, suitability to dock conditions, cost of installation, and loading capacity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Six DOF offset sensing {{between two}} plates is {{important}} for automatic docking mechanisms. This paper presents an easy and inexpensive implementation of such a system using four commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) infrared (IR) light emitting diode (LED) emitters and two COTS IR receivers on each of two <b>docking</b> <b>plates.</b> The angular intensity distribution of an emitter and the sensitivity distribution of a receiver allow for estimation of the angle and distance between them. Simple experiments have been conducted indicating that such a setup is able to give positional offset in any of 6 degrees of error (x, y, z, pitch, roll, and yaw) within a range. A theoretical framework is also established using least squares minimization. The theoretical framework is general and applies to other configurations of emitter and receiver parts and positioning. 1...|$|R
40|$|Combining DNA origami with {{solid-state}} nanopores {{has been}} gaining an increasing amount of attention due to its potential for biosensing applications. Accordingly, origami plate dockings onto conventional solid-state silicon nitride pores with membranes of ? 20 nm thick were previously studied. Here, we examine whether graphene, with its single layer of carbon atoms, poses advantages over silicon-nitride pores. The conductance blockades due to origami plate dockings were characterized {{as a function of}} salt concentration and applied bias voltage and compared to the silicon-nitride data. As expected, it was found that conductance blockades increase with salt concentration and voltage. The relative conductance drop in graphene was however found to be similar to that for silicon nitride pores, whereas theory predicts that the blockade signal is larger in graphene pores. We have further compared the root-mean-squared noise levels of the ionic current through hybrid graphene-origami pores and bare pores, and found that the noise in the hybrid pores was slightly higher than in the bare pore current. Finally, it was tested whether the plates stick to the graphene pore in presence of EDTA. This was done by <b>docking</b> the <b>plates</b> and subjecting them to a negative ramping voltage. Without EDTA, no evidence of sticking was found, whereas with EDTA, 88. 2 % of <b>docked</b> <b>plates</b> appeared to be sticking. Technische NatuurkundeBionanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sensors play {{important}} roles in automatic systems; smart systems have to be equipped with smart sensors. PolyBot, a modular self-reconfigurable robot developed at the Palo Alto Research Center, is designed with a rich set of sensors in each of its 5 cm-cubed modules. These include infrared (IR), accelerometers, potentiometers, force, and touch sensors. These sensors are used: to determine {{the current state of}} the system and its environment; to obtain the six degree-of-freedom offset between two <b>docking</b> <b>plates</b> for automatic reconfiguration; to select the right gait for locomotion; and to trigger different behavior modes in response to different terrain conditions. Sensor computations are computational methods that, given raw sensor data, extract or deduce the state information about the system. In general, there are two types of sensor computation, forward computation and inverse computation. Analogous to forward and inverse kinematics, forward sensor computation obtains state information directly from sensor data; inverse sensor computation obtains state information by solving a constraint or optimization problem using either closed-form or numerical methods. This paper focuses on two interesting sensor computations in PolyBot: IR 6 DOF ranging and accelerometer 2 DOF orientation. 1...|$|R
50|$|Kingston was {{attacked}} by German aircraft on 5 April and was further damaged by a near miss. On 8 April she {{was hit by a}} bomb, forward. This penetrated the decks and passed out of the ships bottom without exploding. But now the destroyer needed to go into dock for underwater repairs. On 9 April she was placed in No. 4 dock, but remained afloat. By 11 April she was still afloat in the <b>dock.</b> - perhaps <b>plates</b> bent outwards by the passage of the bomb through the bottom made it impossible to dock-down and these plates were being burnt away by divers. At about 17.30 on 11 April 1942 she was hit on the port side amidships {{in the area of the}} bulkhead between the engine-room and the gearing-room. She rolled over on her port side and sank in the dock. The ship was declared a constructive total loss. On 21 January 1943 the No. 4 dock was dried-out. The damaged midships part of the destroyer was scrapped, thus separating the destroyer in two sections. Dummy bulkheads were fitted to make the two sections float-able while an amount of the superstructure was burnt away. The two sections of Kingston were floated out of the dock on 5 April 1943 and in June were scuttled as a blockship between the Selmun headland and Selmunett Island (St Paul's Island) in northern Malta in the preparations for making a safe anchorage before the invasion of Sicily. In the early 1950s the two sections of the Kingston were scrapped, where sunk, by Italian shipbreakers.|$|R
