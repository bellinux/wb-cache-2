2500|$|In November 2002, {{after the}} {{completion}} of the mission's only encounter with Jupiter's moon Amalthea, problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued Galileo. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, Galileo stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode, apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, {{it was found that the}} recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play back data. After weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor <b>encoder</b> <b>wheel.</b> The GaAs LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced atomic lattice displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor <b>encoder</b> <b>wheel</b> was incorrectly positioned. Galileo flight team then began a series of [...] "annealing" [...] sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{accurately}} model the motion of an existing two wheeled robot for the future development and testing of new motion algorithms. The model includes some of the physical structure of the robot. As part of the structure, sensor readings from <b>encoder</b> <b>wheels</b> are modeled to determine {{the rotation of the}} wheels.

The physical model of the robot covers the electro-mechanical system from the voltage applied to the motors to the wheel-rotation generated.

Each roller is on the same shaft as an <b>encoder</b> <b>wheel</b> that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement.

30|$|In {{autonomous}} robotics, {{there is}} a need to accurately estimate the movements of a vehicle. A simple movement sensor like a <b>wheel</b> <b>encoder</b> on a ground robot or a pit log on a vessel will under ideal circumstances provide quite accurate movement measurements. Unfortunately, they are sensitive to disturbances. For example, wheel slip due to a wet surface will be interpreted incorrectly by a <b>wheel</b> <b>encoder,</b> and strong currents will not be correctly registered by the pit log why a position estimate based solely on these sensors will drift off. In applications like autonomous robotics, the movement accuracy needs to be high why other redundant movement measurement methods are required.|$|R
40|$|Planetary Gears (PG) {{are widely}} used in many {{important}} transmission systems such as helicopters and wind turbines due to its advantages of high power-weight ratio, self-centering and high transmission ratio. Vibration based condition monitoring of PG has received extensive researches for ensuring safe operations of these critical systems. However, due to the moving mesh gears and noise influences, the diagnostics of planet gear faults by conventional vibration measurements needs intensive signal processing but provides less satisfactory performance. This study investigates Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) based diagnostics which associates more directly with gear dynamics and is not influenced by the moving mesh gears. A pure torsional dynamic model of a PG is developed to gain the characteristics of IAS under different fault cases. Then experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} this IAS based diagnostics. Particularly, IAS signatures obtained by demodulating the frequency modulated pulse trains produced by two in-house made <b>encoder</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted at both the input and output of the PG. In addition, order spectrum analysis is applied to IAS signals to highlight fault components. IAS order spectra exhibit clear changes in the spectral amplitudes associating with different fault frequencies, showing consistent and efficient diagnostics.

40|$|The motion {{counter and}} trigger module is a module {{which must be}} able to {{determine}} coordinates of a mobile unit according to moving sensors, and to send a serial stream when the mobile unit has reached a determined distance. More precisely, a trigger is generated when the distance has been reached, and consequently a stream is built up and sent through a serial line. Basically, the stream contains calculated coordinates values. This module must be implemented on a hardware-platform composed basically of a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and a processor. The processor is responsible for fetching the correct instruction for the FPGA processes execution. The moving sensors are incremental <b>encoder</b> <b>wheels,</b> which signals have to be analysed by the FPGA. However, sensors lines mustn 't be directly connected to the hardware-platform connector which is directly linked to the FPGA pins, because there is no voltage security and the FPGA can be destroyed. Therefore a voltage interface has to be developped in order to protect inputs and outputs of the FPGA pins with external elements. Then a VHDL program has to be implemented into the FPGA in order to carry out the motion counter and trigger module. A motion counter module generates the coordinates values, and it has two operation modes: The first one is to calculate coordinates according to moving sensors information, and the second one is to generate emulated coordinates. A trigger module generates a trigger each time a determined distance has been reached, and then a stream can be built up and sent through a serial line. Moreover, a receiver module gets back the serial stream, and stores the deserialized stream data into SRAM. (In this way, a control of sent stream data can be done). A practical case where this motion counter and trigger module is required is a moving unit which need to perform a measurement every ten centimeters. A trigger is generated each time the moving unit has reached ten centimeters, then a stream is sent, and the reception of this stream by an other module initiates a new trigger where measurements can be performed, and data of this measurement could be stored with the corresponding coordinates...|$|E

To conduct an evaluation and comparison of the different sensors, an optical <b>encoder</b> <b>wheel</b> was used for vehicle odometry and provided a measurement of the linear displacement of the prototype vehicle along a row of tree seedlings as a reference for each recorded sensor measurement. The field trials were conducted in a juvenile tree nursery with one-year-old grafted almond trees at Sierra Gold Nurseries, Yuba City, CA, United States. Through these tests and subsequent data processing, each sensor was individually evaluated to characterize their reliability, {{as well as their}} advantages and disadvantages for the proposed task. Test results indicated that 95. 7 % and 99. 48 % of the trees were successfully detected with the LIDAR and light curtain sensors, respectively. LIDAR correctly classified, between alive or dead tree states at a 93. 75 % success rate compared to 94. 16 % for the light curtain sensor.

For the general algorithm, we need a method to map the whole maze, which is required if the maze is complex. The proposed maze mapping system is based on coordinate system and after mapping the whole maze as a graph in standard 'Adjacency-list representation' method, shortest path and shortest time path was extracted using Dijkstra's algorithm. In order to find the coordinates of the turning points and junctions, linear distance between the points are needed, for which <b>wheel</b> <b>encoder</b> was used.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the tire and the road is crucial for determining the dynamic behavior of a road vehicle, and the road–tire contact forces are key variables {{in the design of}} traction, braking, and stability control systems. Traditionally, road–tire contact forces are indirectly estimated from vehicle-dynamics measurements (chassis accelerations, yaw-roll rates, suspension deflections, etc.). The emerging of the “smart-tire” concept (tire with embedded sensors and digital-computing capability) has made possible, in principle, a more direct estimation of contact forces. In this field—still in its infancy—the main open problems are the choice of the sensor(s) and the choice of the regressor(s) to be used for force estimation. The objective of this work is to present a new sensor–regressor choice, and to provide some preliminary experimental results, which confirm the validity of this choice. The idea is to use a <b>wheel</b> <b>encoder</b> and an accelerometer mounted directly in the tire. The measurement of the in-tire acceleration is transmitted through a wireless channel. The key innovative concept is to use the phase shift between the <b>wheel</b> <b>encoder</b> and the pulse-like signals provided by the accelerometer as the main regressor for force estimation...|$|R
