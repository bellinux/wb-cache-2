5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liaquat Ali Khan, {{appointed}} {{as the first}} prime minister by the Governor-General in 1947, was assassinated in 1951. Six further prime ministers served between 1951 and 1958, when the office was dissolved by Iskander Mirza, the President of Pakistan. A later president, Yahya Khan, appointed Nurul Amin as prime minister in 1971, although Amin held the post for only thirteen days. Under the 1973 constitution of Pakistan, the post was recreated and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became prime minister. Bhutto was overthrown by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during Operation Fair Play in 1977, the position was abolished and Zia became Chief Martial Law Administrator. Muhammad Khan Junejo was {{appointed as}} prime minister by Zia in 1985, and subsequently dismissed under the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the Constitution of Pakistan in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the excessive bail provision of the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the party}} is divided on {{repealing}} the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Kenny had pledged that his party's Oireachtas members {{will be given a}} free vote on the issue.Current leader Leo Varadkar is in favour of holding a referendum on repealing the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> and several Fine Gael TDs, notably Kate O'Connell, are prominent supporters of the pro-choice side.|$|E
25|$|By invoking 42 U.S.C. 1983, Hill {{argues that}} the {{procedures}} for carrying out lethal injection as prescribed by the Florida Department of Corrections are intended to violate his <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right against cruel and unusual punishment. The Eleventh Circuit’s dismissal of his petition, Hill argues, fails to adjudicate his <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> claim, and, accordingly, requests the Eleventh Circuit's ruling be reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Focusing on {{cases that}} relate to the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendments</b> of the U.S. Constitution, the subject matter comes alive through a unique blend of content, including: ...|$|R
5000|$|The ruling's {{reference}} to [...] "evolving standards of decency" [...] is frequently cited precedent in the court's {{interpretation of the}} <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> prohibition on [...] "cruel and unusual punishment." ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to Thompson's rapidly {{approaching}} execution, {{his attorneys}} subsequently filed his {{case with the}} Supreme Court, saying that the execution of a juvenile was unconstitutional under the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> [...] "Cruel and Unusual Punishment" [...] clause.|$|R

25|$|In a concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. {{joined the}} {{majority}} opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. However, he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia’s law with the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, {{the question of the}} statute's constitutionality under the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> did not come up in the case.|$|E
5000|$|Interestingly, the Court later {{seemed to}} back away from this holding. Justice Stevens' Opinion for the Court {{directly}} stated: [...] "...the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause imposes substantive limits on the States' discretion, making the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States." [...] Nine years later, however, in a footnote to his Opinion for the Court in McDonald v. City of Chicago , Justice Alito wrote: [...] "We never have decided whether the Third <b>Amendment</b> or the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States through the Due Process Clause." [...] The discrepancy between these two views has not yet been resolved.|$|R
50|$|Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, 492 U.S. 257 (1989), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{prohibition}} of unreasonable fines does not apply to punitive-damage awards in civil cases when the United States is not a party.|$|R
50|$|Penry was {{overruled}} in 2002 by Atkins v. Virginia, {{which held}} that the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> ban on {{cruel and unusual punishment}} precluded the execution of the mentally handicapped, but the Supreme Court left the definition of mentally handicapped as something to be determined by the states.|$|R

5000|$|While Simmons had {{the right}} to appellate review, it did not violate the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{prohibition}} on [...] "cruel and unusual punishment" [...] for Simmons to not be forced to request appellate review, and thus Whitmore had not cause for action as an interested member of the public.|$|R
25|$|Kennedy v. Louisiana, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} Supreme Court of the United States that held that the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits imposing {{the death penalty for}} the rape of a child in cases where the victim did not die and death was not intended.|$|R
25|$|This {{case was}} argued on October 13, 2004. The appeal {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} capital punishment for persons who were juveniles when their crimes were committed, citing the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> protection against cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
25|$|Sharif had {{attempted}} to reduce the president's powers. With growing tensions between him and President Khan, in April 1993 the latter used the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to dismiss Sharif as Prime Minister, citing corruption and misadministration.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{ruled in}} Kansas v. Marsh that the Kansas Death Penalty was unconstitutional because the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> prohibits {{imposing}} death when mitigating and aggravating sentencing factors were equally balanced.

25|$|Herrera v.

5000|$|While the Court was {{referring}} in Trop {{only to the}} <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the underlying conception - namely, that the Constitution is written in broad terms, and that the Court's interpretation of those terms should reflect current societal conditions - {{is the heart of}} the [...] "living Constitution" [...] doctrine.|$|R
25|$|The Court {{stated that}} Riggins' <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{argument}} that the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication denied him the chance to show the jury his true mental state at the sentencing hearing was not raised in the petition for certiorari and therefore was not addressed by the court.|$|E
25|$|The United States Supreme Court {{has ruled}} {{in the case}} of Roper v. Simmons that persons may not be {{executed}} for crimes committed when below the age of eighteen. It ruled that such executions are cruel and unusual punishment, so they are a violation of the <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The Ledbetter {{decision}} was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed.

5|$|In other {{instances}} Black took a fairly broad {{view of the}} rights of criminal defendants. He joined the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Miranda v.

50|$|These factual {{determinations}} {{provided the}} Department of Justice with reasonable cause {{to believe that}} Escambia County Jail's practices violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process protections for pre-trial detainees, {{as well as the}} <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> protections for those convicted of a criminal offense. Those amendments prohibit jail officials from showing deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement posing an excessive risk of harm to prisoners.|$|R
2500|$|The First through <b>Eighth</b> <b>Amendments</b> {{address the}} means by which the federal {{government}} exercises its enumerated powers, while the Ninth Amendment addresses a [...] "great residuum" [...] of rights that have not been [...] "thrown {{into the hands of the}} government," [...] as Madison put it.
