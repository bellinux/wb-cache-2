He was initially uncomfortable with the accolade, but later found <b>it</b> <b>funny.</b> Also in 2011, he was dubbed International Man of the Year by GQ and appeared in AskMen's 49 most influential men. He ranked tenth on Empire list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013. He {{was one of the}} highest-paid actors in the world from 2013 to 2015, earning $28 million, $46 million, and $41.5 million, respectively. Forbes ranked him first on their Celebrity 100: Ones To Watch list in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, he featured on Celebrity 100, a list based on the income and popularity of celebrities, as selected annually by Forbes. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.|$|E

25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience will not find <b>it</b> <b>funny.</b> Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E

Before producing the episode, writer Stephen King was approached by the Family Guy production team to create the episode, and obtain his written permission to create it; with King agreeing to allow the show to create the parody. King later stated that he enjoyed the episode and found <b>it</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E
500|$|Project X was {{released}} in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 2, 2012, and grossed over $100million worldwide during its theatrical run. Criticism focused on the [...] "loathsome" [...] behavior of the lead characters, the perceived misogyny and the disregard {{for the effects of}} drug use. Other reviews considered <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> and thrilling, and equated it to a modern incarnation of the 1978 comedy Animal House. Following release, incidents of large-scale parties referenced or blamed the film as an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Academic {{critics of}} the first half of the 20th century {{continued}} to approach The Country Wife gingerly, with frequent warnings about its [...] "heartlessness", even as they praised its keen social observation. At this time nobody found <b>it</b> <b>funny,</b> and positive criticism tried to rescue it as satire and social criticism rather than as comedy. Macaulay's [...] "licentious" [...] Mrs. Pinchwife becomes in the 20th century a focus for moral concern: to critics such as Bonamy Dobrée, she is a tragic character, destined to have her naiveté cruelly taken advantage of by the [...] "grim, nightmare figure" [...] of Horner.|$|E

Thrilled that his name is his sister's first word, Marge explains to Bart that Lisa adores him.

[...] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered {{as a teenager in}} suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered.

500|$|Initial {{mainstream}} critical {{response to}} But I'm a Cheerleader was mostly negative. Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} score of 34% based on 47 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews. The overall theme of reviews {{is that it is}} a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed. Some reviewers found <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> and enjoyable with [...] "genuine laughs", however. Roger Ebert rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it [...] "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit." [...] Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{several of}} the Fox {{executives}} who had disliked Get a Life came to Mirkin and apologized for {{the way they had}} treated the show, stating that they now found <b>it</b> <b>funny.</b> They commissioned Mirkin to write, produce and direct a similarly-themed show of his choice. Mirkin produced a pilot for Jeff of the Universe, a [...] "sarcastic" [...] parody of the science fiction genre. The executives who had disproved of Get a Life had since moved from the Fox Network to Fox Studios, and they liked this new show. However, the new executives at Fox did not, and chose not to air the show. Mirkin often plays clips from the show at the talks he does at colleges; they receive a positive response.|$|E
500|$|Bilingualism in a Germanic {{language}} and Latin was {{especially important in}} the military for officers in command of units recruited from Germanic-speaking areas. Tacitus observes that Arminius, the Cheruscan officer who later led a disastrously successful rebellion against the Romans, was bilingual. The emperor Julian employed a bilingual Germanic military tribune as a spy. The officers and secretaries who kept the records preserved in the Vindolanda tablets were Batavian, but their Latin contains no hint; the common soldiers of their units, however, may have retained their Germanic speech. Less commonly, Latin-speaking officers learned a Germanic language through their service and acted as interpreters. Acquiring Germanic might {{be regarded as a}} dubious achievement inducing anxieties of [...] "barbarism": in 5th-century Gaul, Sidonius thinks <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> that his learned friend Syagrius has become fluent in Germanic.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of his review of [...] "La Couchette", Stevens {{suggested}} that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. He noted, though, that [...] "even if they don’t make you laugh, you have to concede this duo are the most febrilely inventive writers on TV." [...] Wollaston, who reviewed the episode for The Guardian, observed that humour generally is extremely personal, and said that he [...] "never really got Shearsmith and Pemberton's stuff". He said he could appreciate the narrative and artistry of [...] "La Couchette", and could understand why others found <b>it</b> <b>funny,</b> but that he does not love Inside No. 9, and that, when watching, he is [...] "just not laughing". A viewer unimpressed with the episode wrote to The Times. Disagreeing with Billen's review, the reader claimed that the episode's [...] "puerile humour [...] flatulent as its one-dimensional figures".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{partially}} {{inspired by the}} commercials for the Christian Children's Fund, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for starving children in Africa. Parker {{said he did not}} really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with [...] "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die {{at the end of the}} episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.|$|E

Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make <b>it</b> <b>funny,</b> sometimes you can get a message across [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Banks, on the song, said that [...] " [...] sort of Bob Dylan meets John Lennon." ...|$|E

500|$|There were {{difficulties}} {{getting this}} episode {{up to the}} minimum length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production. The episode starts with a repeat of a couch gag that was first used in the episode [...] "Lisa's First Word", which is considerably longer than the typical couch gag. The crew added an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon and a few misleads as to {{who was trying to}} kill Bart. Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. This {{led to the creation of}} the rake sequence, which became a memorable moment of the episode, and the entire series. Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row. According to executive producer Al Jean, the idea was to make the scene funny, then drag the joke out so that it is no longer funny, and then drag it out even longer to make <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> again.|$|E
500|$|Lopez's second studio album, J.Lo, was {{released}} in January 2001 through Epic Records.

It became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on {{to become one of the}} best selling remix albums of all time. Lopez's third studio album This Is Me... Then (2002) peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and earned double-platinum status in the United States.

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{compared it}} to the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip", but said [...] "Camping" [...] was [...] "somewhat more of a placeholder". Kandell compared the characters' pressure to meet the city's expectations to those the show faces {{now that they have}} been renewed for a fourth season. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it [...] "a fun episode, but also one that felt like sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins". He compared the pressure on Leslie {{to come up with an}} idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called <b>it</b> <b>funny</b> and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida Jones's performance and the focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.|$|E
