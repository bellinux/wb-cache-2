2500|$|As Austen scholar Norman Page explains, [...] "the first {{sentence}} is straight narrative, in the 'voice' {{of the the}} third sentence is normal indirect speech; but the second and fourth are what is usually described as free indirect speech." [...] In these two sentences, Austen represents the inner thoughts of the character and creates the illusion that the reader is entering the character's mind. She often uses indirect speech for background characters. However, Page writes that [...] "for Jane Austen... the supreme virtue of free indirect speech... that it offers the possibility of achieving something of the vividness of speech without the appearance <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> a total silencing of the authorial voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|His motets are {{the most}} {{progressive}} part of his output, and are characteristic of the mid-century practice intermediate between the smooth, pervading imitation of composers such as Nicolas Gombert, where all voices where equal, and textural contrast was minimized; and late-century composers such as Lassus. [...] Indeed, many of his motets are reminiscent of Lassus, using chromaticism, cross-relations, textural contrast, and always remaining carefully attentive to the comprehensibility of the text. [...] Waelrant uses text-painting as well, highlighting individual words with characteristic gestures, as a method to increase the expressivity of the music. [...] Occasionally, his use of text-painting is obvious: [...] for example, in his chanson Musiciens qui chantez, after the word [...] "taire" [...] (silent) all the voices rest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence.|$|E

At first, Babydoll seems reluctant as the High Roller becomes more intimate, but soon starts warming up to him. The High Roller explains that in exchange for this one moment of truth, he will give her absolute freedom, as an abstract ideal. Babydoll willingly pulls him close to her, and they kiss.
