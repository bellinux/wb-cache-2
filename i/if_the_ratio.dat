5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

500|$|Carbon is {{distributed}} throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir, and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir.

[...] This affects the ratio of [...] to [...] in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir. The atmosphere, which is where [...] is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the [...] it contains mixes in less than seven years.

50|$|A {{definition}} of a physical quantity is a statement that determines <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of any two instances of the quantity. The specification {{of the value of}} any constant factor is {{not a part of the}} definition since it does not affect <b>the</b> <b>ratio.</b> <b>The</b> {{definition of}} velocity above satisfies this requirement since it implies that v1/v2 = (d1/d2)/(t1/t2); thus <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>ratios</b> of distances and times are determined, then so is <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of velocities. A {{definition of a}} unit of a physical quantity is a statement that determines <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of any instance of the quantity to <b>the</b> unit.

2500|$|One {{technique}} is to insert the compressor {{in a parallel}} signal path. This is known as parallel compression, a form of upward compression, which can give a measure of dynamic control without significant audible side effects, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen {{in one of the}} two parallel signal paths—this is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called New York compression or Motown compression. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when [...] compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.|$|E

[...] Another factor can be how overhang seats are handled, district seats that a party wins in excess of the number due to it under the list vote. [...] To achieve proportionality, other parties require [...] "balance seats", increasing the size of parliament by twice the number of overhang seats, but this is not always done. [...] Until recently, Germany increased the size of parliament by the number of overhang seats but did not use the increased size for apportioning list seats. [...] This was changed for the 2013 national election after the constitutional court rejected the previous law, not compensating for overhang seats had resulted in a negative vote weight effect. [...] Lesotho, Scotland and Wales do not increase the size of parliament at all, and, in 2012, a New Zealand parliamentary commission also proposed abandoning compensation for overhang seats, and so fixing the size of parliament. [...] At the same time, it would abolish the single-seat threshold any such seats would then be overhang seats and would otherwise have increased the size of parliament further and reduce the vote threshold from 5% to 4%.

60|$|There {{is another}} and an equally strong {{reason why the}} law of a complex effect must be less general than {{the laws of the}} causes which conspire to produce it. The same causes, acting {{according}} to the same laws, and differing only in the proportions in which they are combined, often produce effects which differ not merely in quantity, but in kind. The combination of a centripetal with a projectile force, in the proportions which obtain in all the planets and satellites of our solar system, gives rise to an elliptical motion; but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of the two forces to each other were slightly altered, it is demonstrated that the motion produced would be in a circle, or a parabola, or an hyperbola; and it is thought {{that in the case of}} some comets one of these is probably the fact. Yet the law of the parabolic motion would be resolvable into the very same simple laws into which that of the elliptical motion is resolved, namely, the law of the permanence of rectilineal motion, and the law of gravitation. If, therefore, in the course of ages, some circumstance were to manifest itself which, without defeating the law of either of those forces, should merely alter their proportion to one another (such as the shock of some solid body, or even the accumulating effect of the resistance of the medium in which astronomers have been led to surmise that the motions of the heavenly bodies take place), the elliptical motion might be changed into a motion in some other conic section; and the complex law, that the planetary motions take place in ellipses, would be deprived of its universality, though the discovery would not at all detract from the universality of the simpler laws into which that complex law is resolved. The law, in short, of each of the concurrent causes remains the same, however their collocations may vary; but the law of their joint effect varies with every difference in the collocations. There needs no more to show how much more general the elementary laws must be than any of the complex laws which are derived from them.|$|E
