5|$|Stone {{has also}} {{received}} a number of non-performance honors. She was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995 for her contribution to acting. The actress was nominated for Golden Apple Award for being <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> according to her co-stars. In 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France. She received recognition at the 2006 Women Film Critics Circle Awards for her collaborations with AmfAR with their research on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{has also}} been awarded for {{activities}} other than acting.

This definition is elegant and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.|$|E
25|$|The strength, hardness, and {{flexibility}} of copper {{make it very}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with.</b> Copper wiring can be installed simply and easily with no special tools, washers, pigtails, or joint compounds. Its flexibility {{makes it easy to}} join, while its hardness helps keep connections securely in place. It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings. The combination of all of these factors makes it easy for electricians to install copper wire.|$|E

Hayes released the DFV initially to French team Matra, headed by Ken Tyrrell with Jackie Stewart as a driver. What followed was a golden age, where teams big or small could buy an engine which was competitive, light, compact, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> and relatively cheap (£7,500 at 1967 prices or about £90,000 in 2005 money). The DFV effectively replaced the Coventry Climax as the standard F1 powerplant for the private (mostly British) teams.|$|E
25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber {{is used for}} plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>with</b> hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|When Indira came {{to power}} in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US President. At that time, India was reliant on USA for food aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt {{policies}} favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). Relations with US strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favoring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. Nixon despised Indira politically and personally. Indira met President Ronald Reagan in 1981 {{for the first time at}} the North–South Summit held to discuss global poverty. Indira had been described to him as an 'Ogre' but he found her charming and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> and they formed a close working relationship during her premiership in 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1835, {{the first}} {{sandstone}} quarry in Giffnock opened. Before long, the town became known for this industry, {{and at its}} peak, there were four quarries in Giffnock, three surface quarries and one underground quarry, which together employed over 1,000 men. The quarries produced two types of sandstone: [...] "liver rock" [...] and [...] "moor rock". [...] "Liver rock" [...] was particularly popular with masons thanks to its lack of stratification, which made the stone <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with.</b> In 1854, a coal mining firm managed by civil engineers Hugh Baird and Robert Stevenson took over {{the running of the}} quarries and by 1866 the Busby Railway was built, allowing them to transport the stone by rail. [...] Originally, a lower level line was laid from Giffnock railway station into the Orchard Quarry to facilitate the extraction of the stone.|$|E

500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more remarkable is that they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult to put some of them upon a gallop."

2500|$|Most {{houses in}} North America are wood-framed structures. Wood {{is one of}} the best {{materials}} for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. [...] In older homes the most significant weaknesses are the connection from the wood-framed walls to the foundation and the relatively weak [...] "cripple-walls." [...] (Cripple walls are the short wood walls that extend from the top of the foundation to the lowest floor level in houses that have raised floors.) [...] Adding connections from the base of the wood-framed structure to the foundation is almost always an important part of a seismic retrofit. [...] Bracing the cripple-walls to resist side-to-side forces is essential in houses with cripple walls; [...] bracing is usually done with plywood. [...] Oriented strand board (OSB) does not perform as consistently as plywood, and is not the favored choice of retrofit designers or installers.|$|E
