Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the novel. The tone {{of the novel is}} often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

25|$|At Compline (whether Small or Great) a Canon to the Theotokos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>of</b> the Week will {{normally}} be read (these Canons {{will be found}} in the Octoechos). Services to saints in the Menaion that for various reasons cannot be celebrated on the day assigned to them, may be chanted on the nearest convenient day at Compline. In such cases, the Canon for the Saint would be read together with the Canon to the Theotokos, followed by the Stichera to the saint from Vespers. There are also particular days (such as certain Forefeasts, Afterfeasts, and days during the Pentecostarion) that have special Canons for Compline composed for them.|$|E
25|$|When the Daughters of Bilitis or the Mattachine Society had a convention, {{the news}} was reported. The {{magazine}} compiled {{some of the first}} statistics about lesbians in the United States by sending their readership questionnaires, the first in 1957 and again in 1963. There was a marked difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the magazine after Barbara Gittings heard Frank Kameny speak at the national DOB convention that attempting to find the cause of homosexuality {{was a waste of time}} since it was equal to heterosexuality. Many articles from 1956 to 1963 focused on ways to function in an overwhelmingly homophobic world, but gradually articles began to appear that were unapologetic in promoting lesbianism.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of its {{publication}} in July 1791, the book had been printed in four variants, differing only in front matter. In the first two variants, 1790 is given as the year of publication, and in the other two variants it is 1791. The 1790 variants have two title pages, one in Slavonic-Serbian (folio 1 verso), and the other in German (folio 2 recto). The earlier of these variants contains a dedication to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik composed by Kurzbeck, while the other variant has no dedication. The 1791 variants have one title page (folio 2 recto) with both the Slavonic-Serbian and the German version of the title. The preceding page (folio 1 verso) contains a copperplate engraving depicting Count Francis Balassa, and these two variants differ only in some details of the engraving. After the title page comes a dedication to Balassa, composed by Kurzbeck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> humble devotion. All variants have the same foreword written by Kurzbeck, while none of them mentions Jacob Rodde as the source or Teodor Avramović as the editor of the dictionary. Only Kurzbeck is mentioned as its publisher. Its source and editor have been identified respectively by Samuel Linde {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century and Pavel Jozef Šafárik in 1865, since when the book has been referred to as the Avramović Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E

The continual shifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the script worked a treat, as every time it looked like things were being allowed to lighten, things once again took {{a turn for the}} worse. And it’s setting up a potentially corking concluding double bill, for not only the series, but also RTD’s four-season story arc." ...|$|E

[...] This was Titanics last intelligible signal, sent as the ship's electrical system began to fail; subsequent messages were jumbled and broken. The two radio operators nonetheless continued sending out distress messages almost to the very end.|$|E

McGavin, noted {{for his role}} in [...] which was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> The X-Files, was originally the casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson in the second season episode [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out {{to play the role of}} Mulder's dad. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Arthur Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files. McGavin was originally supposed to also appear in the Duchovny-penned episode [...] "The Unnatural", but two days after filming began, he suffered a stroke, forcing the producers to remove his scenes from the episode and replace them with another [...] "Arthur Dales", played by M. Emmet Walsh.|$|E

2500|$|Mixtec verbs have no infinitive form. The {{basic form}} of the Mixtec verb is the future tense, and many {{conjugated}} future verb forms are also used for the present tense. To obtain the present of an irregular verb, the tone is modified in accordance with set of complicated prosodic rules. Another class of irregular verbs beginning with [...] mutate that sound to either [...] or [...] in the present tense. To form the preterite (past) tense, the particle ni- (...) is added. That particle causes a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the following verb and, while the particle itself may be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification invariably takes place.|$|E
2500|$|In Stolen Faces (published by Harper & Row in 1977), a {{recently}} demoted commissioner has been reassigned to a colony planet to govern a compound which isolates the sufferers of a leprosy-like disease. Ian Watson {{writes that the}} novel is [...] "about deceit, maskedness and discovery of self-truth…a harsh, arctic tale by contrast with [...] where the terrain may be stark {{but there is a}} mannered elegance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> voice; it is a tale executed in an argot-ritualistic style." [...] Critic Richard Delap writes [...] "There is an abundance of exploitable elements in Bishop's story, so it is astonishing to see how the author keeps them under strict rein, always with a highly keyed visual sense but also with a literary flair that says more by implication than by direct description. The writing itself is crafted with a precision that becomes obvious only as the novel progresses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the Yoshida government encouraged a [...] "3-S" [...] policy — [...] "sports, screen, and sex". This change from the strict pre-war censorship of materials labeled obscene or immoral helped enable a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> literature on Abe. Pre-war writings, such as The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada (1937) depict Abe {{as an example of}} the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies. Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The buraiha writer Oda Sakunosuke wrote two stories based on Abe, and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a [...] "mountain" [...] of erotic books.|$|E
