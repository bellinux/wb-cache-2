5|$|All <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> show {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the Stanford–Binet scales (S-B IV) was developed by Thorndike, Hagen, and Sattler and published by Riverside Publishing in 1986. It retained the deviation scoring of the third revision with each standard deviation from the median being defined as a 16 IQ point difference. The S-B IV adopted new classification terminology. After this test was published, psychologist Nathan Brody lamented that <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> had still not caught up with advances in research on human intelligence during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|<b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E

25|$|Psychologist Alan S. Kaufman {{points out}} that <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> have {{measured}} spatial abilities for 70 years. Modern <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> are greatly influenced by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.|$|E
25|$|To date, tests {{measuring}} EI {{have not}} replaced <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> {{as a standard}} metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.|$|E
25|$|Jensen {{also argued}} that even if g were {{replaced}} by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that all tests of cognitive ability {{would continue to be}} highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests. Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on <b>IQ</b> <b>tests,</b> and this would not please European racists.|$|E

50|$|Pygmalion in the Classroom is a 1968 book by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson {{about the}} effects of teacher {{expectation}} on first and second grade student performance. The idea conveyed in the book is that if teachers' expectations about student ability are manipulated early, those expectations will carry over to affect teacher behavior, which in turn will influence how the students will perform on an <b>IQ</b> <b>test.</b> Inducing high expectations in teachers will lead to high levels of <b>IQ</b> <b>test</b> performance. Inducing low expectations, will lead to low <b>IQ</b> <b>test</b> performance.|$|R

25|$|The many {{different}} kinds of <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> include a wide variety of item content. Some test items are visual, while many are verbal. Test items vary from being based on abstract-reasoning problems to concentrating on arithmetic, vocabulary, or general knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The Flynn {{effect is}} the {{substantial}} and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured {{in many parts}} of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When intelligence quotient (<b>IQ)</b> <b>tests</b> are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.|$|E

50|$|There are {{critics of}} IQ, {{who do not}} dispute the {{stability}} of <b>IQ</b> <b>test</b> scores, {{or the fact that}} they predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively.

25|$|The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} in the United States <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> as {{predictors}} of social achievement are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly {{to the way they}} predict future performance for Caucasians. While agreeing that <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> predict performance equally well for all racial groups, Nicholas Mackintosh also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities. Earl Hunt points out that while this may be the case that would not be a bias of the test, but of society.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial. Early <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although <b>IQ</b> <b>tests</b> have changed substantially {{over the past}} half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many {{school districts in the}} United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Individual IQ {{testing is}} usually the optimal method to {{identify}} giftedness among children. However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted.
