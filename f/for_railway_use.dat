25|$|John and Benjamin Green were {{a father}} and son {{architectural}} practice active in Newcastle. In 1841 Benjamin Green had proposed a high level bridge for road traffic, substantially on the alignment of the actual High Level Bridge; and sensing the commercial climate he explained how it could be adapted <b>for</b> <b>railway</b> <b>use.</b> He failed to get any financial support, but in 1843 George Hudson was looking for ways to extend his railway network northwards, and the Greens' scheme fitted with his takeover of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway; the line got its authorising Act on 22 May 1844, and the Act included the road bridge.|$|E

500|$|With horses {{unable to}} cope, Jones and the Duke decided to convert {{at least part}} of the railway for locomotives. The lightly laid track with {{longitudinal}} sleepers limited them to , and it was thus necessary to use the lightest locomotives possible.

500|$|In late 1871 the {{residents}} of Brill, the former seat of the Mercian kings and the only significant town near Wotton House, petitioned the Duke to extend the route to Brill and to run a passenger service on the line. In January 1872 a passenger timetable was published for the first time, and the line was officially named the [...] "Wotton Tramway", but it was {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Brill Tramway" [...] from its opening to passengers until closure. The new terminus of Brill opened in March 1872. With horses unable to cope with the loads being carried, the Tramway was upgraded for locomotive use. The lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited the locomotive weight to a maximum of nine tons, lighter than almost all locomotives then available, so {{it was not possible to}} use standard locomotives.

2500|$|The tunnel was {{the most}} easterly land {{connection}} {{between the north and}} south banks of the Thames, close to the docks on both banks of the river, and was not far from mainline railways at either end. Converting the tunnel <b>for</b> <b>railway</b> <b>use</b> thus offered a means of providing a cross-Thames rail link without having to go to the expense of boring a new tunnel. On 25 September 1865 the East London Railway Company took ownership of the tunnel at a cost of £800,000. Over the next four years the company built a railway through the tunnel to connect with the existing lines. The company's engineer was Sir John Hawkshaw, who was also responsible for the major re-design and completion of I K Brunel's long-abandoned Clifton Suspension Bridge at Bristol.|$|E

2500|$|This was the railway's {{reason for}} existence. [...] It charged a fixed rate per ton for taking loaded coal wagons from Tilmanstone Colliery to Shepherdswell (no further) for {{switching}} onto {{the main line}} and for returning empties. [...] Since the colliery possessed no locomotives, it also performed necessary shunting duties at the mine, including taking coal from the screens to the power station that ran the electric drainage pumps. [...] Tonnage was over 200,000 after 1926. [...] Rates agreed in 1932 were £0.0315 per ton to Shepherdswell, internal shunting at the colliery at £0.0126 per ton, 1,000 tons of free coal per year <b>for</b> <b>railway</b> <b>use</b> and £0.90 per ton over that. [...] In return, the railway had to obtain all its coal from the colliery, and bad quality {{was to be a}} problem.
