For this reason, the skyscrapers guidelines of Seoul for information on the <b>elevator</b> <b>for</b> evacuation has been established. Nevertheless, when designing buildings to install a <b>elevator</b> <b>for</b> evacuation separately is not effective, so passenger elevators installation according to the criteria are encouraged to use as evacuation elevators. However, this does not include detailed design guidelines so far.
