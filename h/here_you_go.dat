500|$|Adam Sweeney of Film School Rejects was {{positive}} about the episode, [...] "For {{anyone who has been}} complaining that Lost had been too slow lately, <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> Those who watched 'The Variable' saw more action than (basketball player) Wilt Chamberlain. They, and by they I mean we, also got a clear explanation of how the islanders got onto the island. You wanted answers, you got them." [...] Sweeney also believed Davies's acting was the [...] "high point" [...] of the episode. David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented that it was a [...] "good" [...] episode, though he was [...] "bummed" [...] to see Daniel go. Oliver also said that while the episode did [...] "very little" [...] to advance the season storyline significantly, there were [...] "some significant" [...] developments and revelations in it. TV Verdict's Stephen Lackey said the episode was [...] "fast paced" [...] and featured [...] "one exciting twist after another".|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} pleased, Gerald, not at all; and I don't {{see that}} it is any {{laughing}} matter. I never heard a more ridiculous thing. Uncle intrusted Bob to our care, believing that we should do what was best for him; and <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and engage the most feather-headed Irishman in the garrison--and that is saying a good deal, Gerald--to look after him." ...|$|E

6000|$|The two wrong {{answers are}} from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST. The former makes the {{distance}} [...] "23 miles," [...] while her revolutionary companion puts it at [...] "27." [...] GERTY VERNON says [...] "they {{had to go}} 4 miles along the plain, and got {{to the foot of}} the hill at 4 o'clock." [...] They might have done so, I grant; but you have no ground for saying they did so. [...] "It was 7-1/2 miles to the top of the hill, and they reached that at 1/4 before 7 o'clock." [...] <b>Here</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> wrong in your arithmetic, and I must, however reluctantly, bid you farewell. 7-1/2 miles, at 3 miles an hour, would not require 2-3/4 hours. A NIHILIST says [...] "Let x denote the whole number of miles; y the number of hours to hill-top; [** therefore] 3y = number of miles to hill-top, and x-3y = number of miles on the other side." [...] You bewilder me. The other side of what? [...] "Of the hill," [...] you say. But then, how did they get home again? However, to accommodate your views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the opposite side, and also assume (what I grant you is possible, though it is not necessarily true) that there was no level road at all. Even then you go wrong.|$|E

After all my love & thoughtfulness for you--but I guess I [...] need not say anything more, by this time you will have learned [...] your lesson.|$|E

Well, me as well as other things had to dwell and change shapes for a while but now... Winter became spring. There is hope again! ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, a remaster of nkramar's rip was {{released}} by community member Skittle021, saying, [...] "I {{would like to share}} something that I have been working on for the past three years.

5000|$|I {{love the}} '70s, I love black power, black love {{as well as}} temptress vibes and the coolness of how people relayed {{messages}} of love. The Isley Brothers were triple OGs to me and you see their influence in R. Kelly. Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield, {{there was a lot}} happening socially but as far as love, that was a time of real love to me and because my fans had requested real R&B, real songs, and positivity because when they turn on the radio they're not getting that these days, <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> I'm only giving what my fans have requested of me and that's kind of how Smoove Jones was birthed and delivered from me.|$|E

You go learn how to drive it.' Elder was certainly a leader. He might not always be right, {{but he was never}} wrong. One thing about Jake [...] - [...] he was always the same. When you saw him coming, you knew what you were going to get. He was good enough and forceful enough that when he said he'd fixed something, they had confidence in the car and could go out and get something done.|$|E
