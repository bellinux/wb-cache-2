5000|$|Basic {{modifications}} are simple. A lightweight, shortened fiberglass <b>front</b> <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> is fitted {{after the}} sheet metal {{from the trunk}} lid edge forward and rear engine deck lid and everything rearward (rear apron and engine compartment) is removed. The rear treatment leaves the engine totally exposed to aid in cooling. A tubular steel cage front and rear bumper is fitted to the body and floor pan for protection of engine and occupants. Shortened fiberglass fenders both front and rear meant removal of the Beetle's distinctive running boards and the likely addition of more tubular steel parts (side bars) in their place. The rugged torsion bar front and rear suspension standard on the Beetle, allows it to withstand the rigors of offroading and the rear ride height to easily be raised slightly and stiffened to make clearance for larger heavy-duty off-road tires and wheels. The relatively light {{front end of the}} Beetle allows some compensation for the lack of four wheel drive. The taller sidewall tires provide more flexible ride comfort and rocky road ground clearance. The Beetle suspension [...] "stops" [...] can be moved to allow more suspension travel. Longer shock absorbers for the increase in suspension travel, provide more damping control over bumps giving more driver control and comfort. Some people eliminate the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage, allowing extreme amounts of travel with a very comfortable ride.|$|E

50|$|Anglia 105E-based Thames 307E 5 cwt and 7cwt Vans were {{released}} in 1961 and were fitted with the 997cc engine from the Anglia 105E. Although they shared some <b>front</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> with the Anglia Saloon, the vans were structurally quite different {{and had a}} taller windscreen and differently shaped side doors. Left hand drive export versions were designated Thames 308E. The Anglia name was used for certain export markets.|$|R
50|$|The Standard {{version is}} {{exactly like the}} MX-73 Toyota Cressida. It {{does not have the}} {{aggressive}} slanted <b>front</b> end, conservative <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> and framed windows.|$|R
50|$|The facelifted 1.8 XLi and 1.8 SE-G came in late 1998. In {{addition}} to the bigger 1.8-liter 7A-FE engine, the Corolla received new <b>front</b> and rear <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> upgraded interior, and ABS was also standard on the SE-G.|$|R
50|$|A {{facelift}} {{was offered}} in 3 grades, XLi, GLi, and SE-G in 1998. In {{addition to the}} bigger 1.8 liter 7A-FE engine, the Corolla received new <b>front</b> and rear <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> upgraded interior, and ABS was standard on the SE-G.|$|R
5000|$|Styling was by Leo Emerius, taking {{inspiration}} from the Ford Customline. The chromed bars, being a decorative element, required excessive manual labour to assemble, which was not feasible for a mass-produced vehicle. Moreover, they reduced the supporting strength of the <b>front</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b> Finally, as the Soviet Union had great aspirations for the vehicle in generating good revenue, it became immediately apparent that the military connotation would scare potential western customers. At the Soviet pavilion Expo 58, which opened in April, the featured example was the facelift prototype with the 16-slit shark-mouth grille; it also had the originally intended ZMZ [...] overhead valve inline four, the ZMZ 24. Now actually in mass production, priced at 5,400 rubles, the popularity and genuine interest in the vehicle sealed {{the fate of the}} [...] "Star", and in November the [...] "Star" [...] was retired. In any case, in popular culture, the car's alternative nickname as [...] "Zhukovka" [...] survives to this date.|$|R
5000|$|Another Ford {{lightweight}} was the 1964 Ford Thunderbolt that {{utilized the}} mid-size Fairlane body. A stock Thunderbolt could run the quarter-mile (402 m) in 11.76 seconds at 122.7 mph, and Gaspar [...] "Gas" [...] Ronda dominated the NHRA World Championship with his Thunderbolt with a {{best time of}} 11.6 seconds at 124 mph. The Thunderbolt included the 427 engine with special exhausts; though technically legal for street use, the car was too [...] "raucous" [...] for the public roads, according to a Hot Rod magazine quote, [...] "for driving {{to and from the}} strip, let alone on the street in everyday use". Massive traction bars, asymmetrical rear springs, and a trunk-mounted 95 lb bus battery were intended to maximize traction for the car. Sun visors, exterior mirror, sound-deadener, armrests, jack, and lug wrench were omitted to save weight. The car was given lightweight Plexiglass windows, and early versions had fiberglass <b>front</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> and bumpers, later changed to aluminum to meet NHRA regulations. Base price was US$3,780. A total of 111 Thunderbolts were built, and Ford contracted Dearborn Steel Tubing to help with assembly.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera car}} {{used on the}} tracks was a Ford GT40 driven by racing figure Phil Hill. Cameras were mounted at the front and/or rear of the GT40 with <b>front</b> and rear <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> being removed as necessary. Aerial shots were filmed from an Alouette III helicopter. These shots were taken {{so close to the}} actual roads that the cameraman's shoes became stained with bits of greenery from the tips of nearby trees.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{redesign}} itself, the 1972 Thunderbird represented a simplification of body styles. Instead {{of the three}} body styles (landau, two-door and four-door hardtops) offered for the 1971 model year, Thunderbird was pared down to a single two-door hardtop model line. Externally, many components were common with the Lincoln Mark IV, the primary differences being the <b>front</b> and rear <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b> The prominent “beak” of 1971 was toned down while the sequential turn signals seen since 1965 were deleted for cost reasons.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work aims to replace glass fibres in sheet molding compounds (SMC) by renewable natural fibres. These eco-efficient and cost effective SMC with natural fibres are gaining much {{attention in the}} automotive industry because of their specific properties. The specific objective of the work {{was to develop a}} high performance natural fibre hybrid SMC to meet the specifications required for automotive parts such as <b>front</b> fenders, <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> etc. Hemp fibres with and without a combination of a small amount of glass fibres were used to reinforce vinyl ester resin for making SMC. Different combinations of layers of hemp and glass fibres were made to prepare SMC. Mechanical properties, such as tensile and flexural properties and impact strength of the SMC prepared were found to be highly promising. The current OEM specifications for automotive parts, for example, rare lift gate and front fenders, recommend the composite should have tensile strength of 62 MPa and tensile modulus of 2 GPa (Source of Automotive Engineers Car Technology yearbook 2000 ” USA 2000, <b>Body</b> <b>panels</b> Properties). SMC prepared by the combination of 45 % of hemp fibres and 5 % of glass fibres showed tensile strength and modulus were more or less same or better than that of the requirements for car body parts such as rare lift gate and front fenders (Tensile strength greater than 62 MPa and tensile modulus of 2 GPa). Use of this SMC with natural fibre is an economically viable alternative to SMC with glass fibres {{and at the same time}} it helps reducing the green house gas emission, as there is lesser amount of synthetic resins and plastics...|$|R

5000|$|The Torino was {{developed}} by IKA as an Argentine hybrid of AMC's 1964-'65 Rambler American and Classic with exclusively designed <b>front</b> and rear <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> bumpers and interior. The central body section is from the Classic, and the engine and trunk compartments are derived from the American. Rooflines came from the American as well, and some later Torino sedans featured the attractive [...] "C" [...] pillar {{that was used in}} 1968-69 U.S. American sedans. The rear coil suspension was borrowed from the Classic, albeit with a four link setup rather than a torque tube. One unique feature is the Torino's front unibody [...] "frame rails" [...] borrowed from the Classic convertible (also used in the 1965-'66 Marlin). They are longer than the American, extending all the way back under the car {{to the front of the}} rear rails. This made for a stiffer chassis, better adapting the car to the rougher road conditions of Argentina at the time. The Torino rode on a slightly longer wheelbase (than the American) by one inch - 2723 mm (107-inch). Although the engines were not obtained from American Motors, the vehicle's basic AMC platform continued throughout its lifetime. As upgrades were incorporated over the years, such as AMC's flush door handles, the Torino became mostly a product of Argentina with few imported parts.|$|R
