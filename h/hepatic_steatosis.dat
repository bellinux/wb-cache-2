25|$|In {{the early}} stages, {{patients}} with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings.

Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels {{are found to be}} elevated.

These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.|$|E

It is a unique finding in diabetic patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and intraperitoneal insulin treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of insulin causes a unique pattern of fatty infiltration in the subcapsular location of the liver. Here we report a case of <b>hepatic</b> subcapsular <b>steatosis</b> in a diabetic CAPD patient who received intraperitoneal insulin. A 46 -year-old diabetic woman on CAPD presented with general weakness. The patient received a total amount of 110 units of regular insulin via intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injection.

Abdominal CT scan images and MRI revealed characteristic findings consistent with <b>hepatic</b> subcapsular <b>steatosis.</b> We assumed that the cause was CAPD and concomitant intraperitoneal insulin treatment; therefore, the patient was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis (HD) and began to receive insulin subcutaneously.

Current histopathology techniques are inadequate for the clinical evaluation of <b>hepatic</b> microvesicular <b>steatosis.</b> In this paper, we explore the use of multimodal coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy for the detection and characterization of <b>hepatic</b> microvesicular <b>steatosis.</b> We show that CARS microscopy is more sensitive than Oil Red O histology {{for the detection of}} microvesicular steatosis. Computer-assisted analysis of liver lipid level based on CARS signal intensity is consistent with triglyceride measurement using a standard biochemical assay. Most importantly, in a single measurement procedure on unprocessed and unstained liver tissues, multimodal CARS imaging provides a wealth of critical information including the detection of microvesicular steatosis and quantitation of liver lipid content, number and size of lipid droplets, and lipid unsaturation and packing order of lipid droplets. Such information can only be assessed by multiple different methods on processed and stained liver tissues or tissue extracts using current standard analytical techniques. Multimodal CARS microscopy also permits label-free identification of lipid-rich non-parenchymal cells. In addition, label-free and non-perturbative CARS imaging allow rapid screening of mitochondrial toxins-induced microvesicular steatosis in primary hepatocyte cultures. With its sensitivity and versatility, multimodal CARS microscopy should be a powerful tool fo...|$|R

40|$|Failure {{to inhibit}} hepatic gluconeogenesis {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} contributing to fasting hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and, along with steatosis, {{is the hallmark of}} hepatic insulin resistance. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation in multiple tissues, and hepatic inflammation is mechanistically linked to both <b>steatosis</b> and <b>hepatic</b> insulin resistance. Here, we delineate a role for coagulation signaling via tissue factor (TF) and proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2) in obesity-mediated <b>hepatic</b> inflammation, <b>steatosis,</b> and gluconeogenesis. In diet-induced obese mice, TF tail signaling independent of PAR 2 drives CD 11 b+CD 11 c+ hepatic macrophage recruitment, and TF–PAR 2 signaling contributes to the accumulation of hepatic CD 8 + T cells. Transcripts of key pathways of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and inflammatory cytokines were reduced in high-fat diet–fed mice that lack the cytoplasmic domain of TF (F 3) (TFΔCT) or that are deficient in PAR 2 (F 2 rl 1), as well as by pharmacological inhibition of TF–PAR 2 signaling in diet-induced obese mice. These gluconeogenic, lipogenic, and inflammatory pathway transcripts were similarly reduced in response to genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TF–PAR 2 signaling in hematopoietic cells and were mechanistically associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These findings indicate that hematopoietic TF–PAR 2 signaling plays a pivotal role in the <b>hepatic</b> inflammatory responses, <b>steatosis,</b> and <b>hepatic</b> insulin resistance that lead to systemic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in obesity...|$|R

In this paper, a convenient and accurate in vitro HL 7702 <b>steatosis</b> <b>hepatic</b> cell model was applied to evaluate the lipid-lowering effects of the tested polyphenols. The results showed that PPPs possessed the strongest lipid-lowering effects.

Punicalagin displayed the strongest lipid-lowering effects among all the tested components of pomegranate peel polyphenols. Moreover, PPPs and punicalagin (10, 20, 40 μg/mL) significantly increased the mRNA expression of LXRα (Liver X receptor alpha) and its target genes-ABCA 1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1) in a dose-dependent manner in HL 7702 <b>steatosis</b> <b>hepatic</b> cells.

40|$|SummaryThe {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR) {{is linked}} to metabolic dysfunction, yet {{it is not known}} how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) disruption might influence metabolic pathways. Using a multilayered genetic approach, we find that mice with genetic ablations of either ER stress-sensing pathways (ATF 6 α, eIF 2 α, IRE 1 α) or of ER quality control (p 58 IPK) share a common dysregulated response to ER stress that includes the development of <b>hepatic</b> microvesicular <b>steatosis.</b> Rescue of ER protein processing capacity by the combined action of UPR pathways during stress prevents the suppression of a subset of metabolic transcription factors that regulate lipid homeostasis. This suppression occurs in part by unresolved ER stress perpetuating expression of the transcriptional repressor CHOP.
