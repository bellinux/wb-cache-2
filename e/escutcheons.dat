5|$|While still {{involved}} in the disputes over Legislative Council attributions, Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission. The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned coats of arms of the Romanian counties, each bearing the Steel Crown, as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple <b>escutcheons.</b> He was turning {{his attention to the}} Slătineanu branch of his family, and completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of Brăila in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine Analele Brăilei, 1/1929).|$|E
5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The <b>escutcheons</b> (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E
5|$|The white inescutcheon {{is itself}} charged with five smaller blue shields (escudetes) {{arranged}} like a Greek cross (1+3+1). Each smaller shield holds five white bezants {{displayed in the}} form of a saltire (2+1+2). The red bordure is charged with seven yellow castles: three on the chief portion (one in each corner and one in the middle), two in the middle points of each quadrant of the curved base (rotated 45degrees), and two more on each side of the bordure, over the flag's horizontal middle line. Each castle is composed by a base building, showing a closed (yellow) gate, on top of which stand three battlemented towers. In heraldic terminology, the shield's blazon is described as Argent, five <b>escutcheons</b> in cross azure each charged with five plates in saltire, on a bordure gules seven towers triple-turreted Or, three in chief.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, Prussia gained {{extensive}} territories on the Rhine and in Saxony. New arms were therefore decreed on January 9, 1817. The number of quarters rose to 48, including the horse of Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The number of <b>escutcheons</b> was reduced to four: the black eagle of Prussia, the red eagle of Brandenburg instead of the scepter, the burgravate of Nuremberg (though ceded to Bavaria), and Hohenzollern proper.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{surrounded}} by a moat, the buildings of the cross-shaped four-story mansion, with rectangular towers in the front corners, are crowned by a central lantern roof {{dating back to the}} mid-17th century. The front entrance has an 18th-century imperial staircase, edged with balustrades made of trachyte, flanking the original round-arched doorway within a rectangular aperture designed to receive a raised drawbridge. On either side of this lower entrance are sandstone <b>escutcheons</b> bearing the Merode family coat of arms. Two octagonal towers flank the great hall.|$|E
25|$|Frederick William IV was {{followed}} by his brother William I on January 2, 1861. He changed the arms on 11 January 1864 by combining the <b>escutcheons</b> of Nuremberg and Hohenzollern. After the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prussia annexed Schleswig, Holstein, Hanover, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), and Nassau. King William I of Prussia became William I, German Emperor on January 18, 1871 during the unification of Germany. The Kingdom of Prussia became the predominant state in the newly created German Empire.|$|E

25|$|The Torre dello Standardos {{design is}} similar to the coastal watchtowers such as the De Redin towers that the Order built in Malta during the 17th century. It has the same basic layout, with two floors and a scarped base. However, this tower is of finer {{construction}} than the coastal towers, having decorative Baroque elements such as mouldings, as well as <b>escutcheons</b> containing the coats of arms of De Vilhena and the city of Mdina. The tower has a cylindrical stair-hood with a dome, and this feature {{is similar to}} that found at Palazzo Stagno and the now-demolished Gourgion Tower.|$|E
25|$|Directly west {{of these}} rooms is the Edwardian Mappin Wing, which {{contains}} the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in mosaic tile {{and the upper}} with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across {{from the top of}} the stair is a door (to the reception room) flanked with wood panels documenting the names and <b>escutcheons</b> of each of the governors general for New France, British North America, and Canada. On the opposite wall, to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen's Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch's coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth's royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign's badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolised by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post. In 2012, bronze and glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Alexander Lindsay, were added to each side of the stair in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E

500|$|S.nicholsi from Puerto Rico is both bulkier {{and larger}} than the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, {{measuring}} [...] from snout to vent. It also differs {{in the size of}} its dorsal scales, which is reflected in scale count comparisons. S.nicholsi has 19 to 24 dorsal scales from axilla to groin, whereas S.parthenopion has 30 to 35. Also, S.nicholsi has only 34 to 42 scales around the midbody compared to 50 to 55 in S.parthenopion, and its ventral scales from axilla to groin range from 21 to 26, which is still less than 26 to 29 in S.parthenopion. S.nicholsi typically has one internasal scale versus the two more commonly seen in S.parthenopion. The <b>escutcheons</b> are also larger in male S.nicholsi, on average. In terms of colouration, both species are very similar, but S.nicholsi usually has a crescent-shaped pattern on its head that touches the postocular stripes, instead of an oval-shaped pattern {{that may or may not}} reach the stripes. Also, its postocular stripes run the length of its body and tail instead of ending on the neck. The dorsolateral stripes of S.nicholsi converge to make a dark-edged U- or Y-shaped pattern in the sacral (pelvic) region. The majority of S.nicholsi have a pattern on the scapular (shoulder) region consisting of two small pale dots encompassed by small regions of black.|$|E
