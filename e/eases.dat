40|$|When the {{three-dimensional}} garment style {{was transformed into}} the two-dimensional garment pattern, the information of <b>ease</b> distribution was crucial because the <b>ease</b> of the garment {{was one of the}} important elements in constructing garment style. To model the <b>ease</b> distribution of X-line style jackets, the <b>ease</b> distribution was qualitatively presented by the shapes of cross section at different altitude. The newly defined segmental girth <b>ease</b> allowance provided a quantitative understanding of the <b>ease</b> distribution. A mathematical model of <b>ease</b> distribution was established in the X-line style jacket by using the surface fitting approach, which may predict the <b>ease</b> distribution of jackets in different dimensions. The <b>ease</b> distribution models of bustline, waistline, and hipline in X-line style of jackets were satisfactory because of lower root-mean-square error, especially compared with the actually measured data.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} credit-friction model {{developed}} by Curdia and Woodford, {{in a series}} of papers, as the basis for attempting to mimic the behavior of credit spreads in moderate as well as crisis times. We are able to generate movements in representative credit spreads that are, at times, both sharp and volatile. We then study the impact of quantitative <b>easing</b> and credit <b>easing.</b> Credit <b>easing</b> is found to reduce spreads, unlike quantitative <b>easing,</b> which has opposite effects. The relative advantage of credit <b>easing</b> becomes even clearer when we allow borrowers to default on their loans. Since increases in default offset the beneficial effects of credit <b>easing</b> on spreads, the policy implication is that, in times of financial stress, the central bank should be aggressive when applying credit <b>easing</b> policies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the proper amount of hip <b>ease</b> in the skirt lining. We carried out a wear test comparing the skirts that differed in hip <b>ease.</b> The outer fabrics were denim and jersey，which were equal in thickness，and bemberg taffeta was used for the 	lining fabric. The amount of hip <b>ease</b> in the skirt was 2 cm， 6 cm and 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the outer 	fabrics，and 0 cm to 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the lining. Six female subjects were asked to judge the 	single and combination of skirts with regard to garment fit at 14 different positions and 	overall comfort. The wearers graded fit and comfort on a scale from - 2 to + 2. 	There were significant differences in overall comfort between the outer fabrics，the hip 	<b>ease</b> of outer skirts and that of skirt lining. When the amount of hip <b>ease</b> was 2 cm for the 	outer skirts，the subjects felt tightness，regardless of hip <b>ease</b> in the lining. However，they felt 	comfortable or moderately loose over 6 cm <b>ease</b> for the lining on condition that the amount 	of hip <b>ease</b> was 6 cm or 10 cm <b>ease</b> for the outer skirts. 	As the amount of hip <b>ease</b> increased，the additional inner space created by the lining in the jersey skirts.

40|$|Calving <b>ease</b> is of {{economic}} importance in dairy cattle {{and should be}} considered in breeding programs. Economic values of direct and maternal calving <b>ease</b> were derived based on cost-benefit analysis and gene flow methodology.

For an average mate, numbers of discounted expressions for sires to breed replacements were. 58 [...] 44, and. 63 for direct and maternal calving <b>ease</b> and production. Discounted expressions for direct calving <b>ease</b> were higher when sires were mated to primiparous versus multiparous dams. Three alternative breeding strategies were compared: 1) separate selection of sires as mates of primiparous and multiparous cows, based on their respective optimal indexes for direct and maternal calving <b>ease,</b> 2) selection based on the optimal index for an average mate, and 3) selection on direct calving <b>ease</b> only. Strategies 2 and 3 allowed for assortative mating of sires with favorable direct calving <b>ease</b> to primiparous females subsequent to selection. Strategy 2 resulted in maximal economic response. Optimal standardized index weights under Canadian circumstances were approximately 100 : 9 : 7 for production:direct calving ease:maternal calving <b>ease.</b> Inclusion of calving <b>ease</b> traits had a minor effect (<Sa) on selection responses and efficiency but would provide proper guidelines to producers.
