5|$|A {{pedestrian}} safety project {{aimed to}} reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, with the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> {{to take place}} between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. Construction on the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. Construction on the <b>first</b> <b>phase,</b> which will run between 26th Street and MD 90, will begin in October 2017 and be completed in May 2018. Future phases will build the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street and between MD 90 and the Delaware border.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} success at Unsan, {{the rest of}} the Chinese forces {{advanced}} across the US lines, intending to push the US forces back across the Ch'ongch'on River and into Pyongyang. But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the Chinese to disengage on 5 November, thus ending the Chinese <b>First</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign. Besides the victory at Unsan, the Chinese <b>First</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong. In return, the Chinese had suffered 10,700 casualties {{by the end of the}} Chinese <b>First</b> <b>Phase</b> Campaign. The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of the most devastating US losses of the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> saw {{the walls}} built with mudbrick, {{a very common}} feature of Euphrates-area structures.

The small salient bastion that juts out of the northern wall dates to the <b>first</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> of {{the attack}} by {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were to capture the line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. After a pause for the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> was due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the <b>first</b> <b>phase,</b> those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's <b>first</b> <b>phase,</b> the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood.

The <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E
