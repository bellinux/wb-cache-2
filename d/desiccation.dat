5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to <b>desiccation,</b> with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their cytosol. Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of <b>desiccation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent <b>desiccation.</b> In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.|$|E
5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and <b>desiccation.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent <b>desiccation</b> and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual <b>desiccation.</b> The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the <b>desiccation</b> and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} chaetotonid gastrotrichs {{reproduce}} entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male {{portions of the}} reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 µm, they are still very large {{in comparison with the}} animals' size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of <b>desiccation</b> or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days. In the laboratory, Lepidodermella squamatum has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{maintained}} an elaborate set of burial customs {{that they believed}} were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by <b>desiccation.</b> The arid, desert conditions were a boon {{throughout the history of}} ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from <b>desiccation.</b> As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid <b>desiccation</b> while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores.|$|E
5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from <b>desiccation</b> by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.|$|E
5|$|To {{build their}} nests, {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are {{good examples of}} subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against <b>desiccation,</b> light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air <b>desiccation</b> leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist <b>desiccation.</b> The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against <b>desiccation.</b> In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, <b>desiccation,</b> and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|This {{impacted}} amphibians {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which amphibians favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to amphibians. Given that among the hallmarks of amphibians are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to <b>desiccation</b> (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, amphibians were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts among the groups faring worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches at a faster rate and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted amphibians simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E
25|$|Valerie Mattimore of Louisiana State University has {{suggested}} the radioresistance of D. radiodurans {{is simply a}} side effect of a mechanism for dealing with prolonged cellular <b>desiccation</b> (dryness). To support this hypothesis, she performed an experiment in which she demonstrated that mutant strains of D. radiodurans which are highly susceptible to damage from ionizing radiation are also highly susceptible to damage from prolonged <b>desiccation,</b> while the wild-type strain is resistant to both. In addition to DNA repair, D. radiodurans use LEA proteins (Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins) expression to protect against <b>desiccation.</b>|$|E

25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased <b>desiccation,</b> hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to <b>desiccation</b> stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and <b>desiccation</b> stress. Although S. richteri has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, S. richteri was more vulnerable to <b>desiccation</b> stress. The lower sensitivity to <b>desiccation</b> {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.|$|E

25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to <b>desiccation</b> {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid <b>desiccation</b> {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are quite obvious. Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe <b>desiccation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Turkmenistan both {{contributes}} to and {{suffers from the}} consequences of the <b>desiccation</b> of the Aral Sea. Because of excessive irrigation, Turkmen agriculture {{contributes to}} the steady drawdown of sea levels. In turn, the Aral Sea's <b>desiccation,</b> which had shrunk that body of water by an estimated 59,000 square kilometers by 1994, profoundly affects economic productivity and the health {{of the population of the}} republic. Besides the cost of ameliorating damaged areas and the loss of at least part of the initial investment in them, salinization and chemicalization of land have reduced agricultural productivity in Central Asia by an estimated 20 to 25%. Poor drinking water is the main health risk posed by such environmental degradation. In Dashhowuz Province, which has suffered the greatest ecological damage from the Aral Sea's <b>desiccation,</b> bacteria levels in drinking water exceeded ten times the sanitary level; 70% of the population has experienced illnesses, many with hepatitis, and infant mortality is high. Experts have warned that inhabitants will have to evacuate the province by the end of the century unless a comprehensive cleanup program is undertaken. Turkmenistan has announced plans to clean up some of the Aral Sea fallout with financial support from the World Bank.|$|E
25|$|Continued <b>desiccation</b> {{forced the}} early {{ancestors}} of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and forced them to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an herbicide, glyphosate is also used for crop <b>desiccation</b> (siccation) to increase harvest yield, {{and as a result}} of <b>desiccation,</b> to increase sucrose concentration in sugarcane before harvest. The application of glyphosate just before harvest on grains (like wheat, barley, and oats) kills the food crop so that it dries more quickly and evenly, similar to the use of dessicants. This dry crop does not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest but can easily be straight cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money,which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short. Excess residue levels in beans resulting from incorrect application can render the crop unfit for sale.|$|E

Variation in habit can range from dwarf flattened plants to bottle shaped shrubs to dendroid-shaped trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{begins with a}} noninfective cyst being {{excreted}} with the faeces of an infected individual. The cyst is hardy, providing protection from various degrees of heat and cold, <b>desiccation,</b> and infection from other organisms.

25|$|Designers {{and users}} of UDDTs {{should strive to}} keep the feces pile as dry as {{possible}} as {{this is the key}} factor in prevention of odor and flies (flies are not attracted to dry feces). During storage, the feces’ natural moisture slowly evaporates and is exhausted through the vault’s ventilation system, or is absorbed by the dry cover material. This process is called drying, dehydration or <b>desiccation.</b>|$|E
