5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Knight {{introduces}} enemy medics who can shield {{enemies in}} electrified fields and revive unconscious ones, sword-wielding enemies, and brutes who {{are resistant to}} damage and must be stunned {{before they can be}} attacked; brutes wielding Gatling guns, tasers, and blades require additional steps to defeat. <b>Enemies</b> <b>are</b> capable of employing tactics to counter Batman's various skills, including deploying landmines, controlling hovering drones, disabling vents if Batman is found using them, and detecting his location if Batman uses Detective Vision for too long.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{writer and}} propagandist Maksim Gorky, [...] "Class hatred should be {{cultivated}} by an organic revulsion {{as far as}} the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> concerned. <b>Enemies</b> must <b>be</b> seen as inferior. I believe quite profoundly that the <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> our inferior, and is a degenerate not only in the physical plane but also in the moral sense".|$|R

5|$|Spider-Man Unlimited is {{an endless}} runner {{game in which}} Spider-Man runs across New York rooftops, {{including}} that of the Oscorp building, as well as Sinister Six spaceships and a giant Doctor Octopus machine, as he dodges obstacles, defeats enemies, and collect power-ups and vials. Regular <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> defeated by slide attacks and punches, while bosses requires the player to fling projectiles at them. Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or going through a ring also increases the player's combo count. Sections in which Spider-Man swings through streets, climbs the sides of buildings and free-falls from buildings are interspersed with the running portions of the game.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based battles are {{triggered}} through random encounters. The {{player has}} several options, including fighting and fleeing from battle. The number of <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> indicated by small sprites {{on the bottom}} of the battle screen. During their turn in combat, the protagonist and current companion can perform an action such as attacking using melee or ranged attacks such as magic, or use an item which can weaken the enemy or strengthen the player party. Upon successfully completing a battle, the party is awarded with experience points, skill points, items and money. Skill points are assigned to the protagonist's attributes such as speed or magic, modifying future performance in battle.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E

Rubikon {{was well known}} for breaking attendance records at the main room Metro Theatre and other live venues across Australia.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>enemies</b> <b>were</b> {{cut from}} the home console version: in stage 3, the walker <b>enemies</b> <b>were</b> removed and placed only once in the final stage {{while some of the}} organic enemies in stage 4 were either removed or their AI was changed.|$|R
50|$|When <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> {{destroyed}} by Side attack or Back fire attack, the current score multiplier increases by 1, up to 12. The multiplier decreases by 1 {{at a time}} when <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> not {{destroyed by}} either attack for a prolonged time period.|$|R
5|$|Tyrion Lannister and Varys {{walk through}} the streets, which are largely empty because of Daenerys's absence and fear of the Sons of the Harpy. Tyrion observes that Daenerys' <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> growing, {{including}} former slaves and former masters. Varys promises that his spies will find {{the leader of the}} Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that someone has set fire to all of the ships in Meereen's harbor, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys's forces will be unable to sail to Westeros.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> {{removed from the}} board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

Europe's <b>enemy</b> <b>is</b> itself—its self-destructive passivity, its {{softness}} toward tyranny, its reflexive {{inclination to}} appease, and its uncomprehending distaste for America's pride, courage, and resolve {{in the face}} of a deadly foe." ...|$|R

5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|All <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, {{or a combination}} thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The player can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> inefficient in spotting the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E
5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game, such as triggering a sand avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> formed. Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many <b>enemies</b> <b>are</b> openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E
