The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to be leading the vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as {{the next president of}} Panama.

50|$|Holm wrote {{two books}} {{about women in}} the military, {{beginning}} with Women in the Military: An Unfinished Revolution in 1982. Holm updated the book in 1992-1994, filling in American women's combat and military experiences in the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Grenada, <b>Panama</b> and in the Gulf War. In 1998, Holm published a history of American women serving in World War II, entitled In Defense of a Nation: Servicewomen in World War II, summarizing the experiences of women serving all of the military arms.|$|R
50|$|Other reports {{indicated}} that the previously mentioned book was an important secret Japanese high-level document, and was alleged to have been stolen from Kinoaki Matsuo, a high-ranking officer of the Black Dragon Society by Kilsoo Haan, an anti-Japanese Korean patriot.

5|$|The {{idea of an}} American unified special {{operations}} command had its origins {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the American embassy in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> to the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Cheney for {{the office}} of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position. The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0 and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush. Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.|$|E
5|$|Using {{economic}} sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted {{a campaign to}} drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor. In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties. Although the mission was controversial, U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.|$|E
500|$|On September 23, 2001, the EPB {{opened its}} speech by {{discussing}} {{the role of}} the descendants of the criollo class in founding the political parties under the United States administration and preserving the status quo. After completing the usual recapitulation of the historical intervention by the United States and the Vieques protests, the message digressed towards the 9/11 attacks calling the event [...] "inhumane" [...] and [...] "barbaric", citing that [...] "under no pretense the Macheteros can accept, and much less justify acts of this nature". Citing that [...] "revolutionaries are moved by a love for humanity", the organization expressed condolences both to the families of fallen Puerto Ricans and the innocent American public." [...] The EPB, however, expressed that there were similarities between these attacks and the actions [...] "taken by the government of the United States throughout the world" [...] mentioning the death of civilians in Vietnam, Sernia, Yugolslavia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and Irak as example where military intervention resulted in heavy casualties. Shifting its focus to Latin America, the organization discussed the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> and the Dominican Republic and its support of Fulgencio Batista, Rafael Trujillo, Efraín Ríos Montt, Alfredo Stroessner, Anastasio Somoza García, Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Augusto Pinochet as equally unforgivable and done [...] "to satisfy lust of economic power of some infamous minorities". Citing the Ponce massacre as another example, the EPB criticized that local sectors echo their classification as a terrorist organization by the FBI, in their view to [...] "justify open repression" [...] in an effort [...] "to change public opinion" [...] in Puerto Rico. The EPB blamed the Calderón administration for [...] "seeking away to distance [...] from the [...] Vieques problem", also expressing concern that the attacks could be employed to guarantee the permanence of the Navy in Vieques.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. {{launched}} its <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> on December 20, 1989. Although {{the killing of}} the Marine was the ostensible reason for the invasion, the operation had been planned for months before his death. The move was the largest military action by the U.S. since the Vietnam War, and included more than 27,000 soldiers, as well as 300 aircraft. The Bush administration considered lighter assaults using fewer troops, but decided against them. The U.S. forces targeted Noriega's personal private vehicles. Several slums in the middle of Panama City were destroyed in the U.S. bombing campaign. The day after the invasion, Noriega's deputy Colonel Luis del Cid retreated with some soldiers to the mountains outside David City, after laying mines in the airport. Though this was part of a contingency plan for the invasion, del Cid quickly decided that the Panamanian military was {{not in a position to}} fight a guerrilla war against the U.S., and negotiated a surrender. The number of U.S. soldiers that were killed in the operation was between 23 and 60; 300 soldiers were injured. Casualties among the Panamanian forces were much higher; between 300 and 845. A large number of civilians were killed in the invasion: the precise figure is a matter of debate. The U.S. government reported 250 civilian deaths; other observers estimated 3,000 casualties.|$|E

40|$|Background/PurposeAn {{increase}} in group D Salmonella isolates with high antimicrobial resistant rates is being seen in Taiwan. This study aimed {{to determine the}} multidrug-resistant (MDR, more than three antibiotics) phenotype, genotype, and {{the correlation between the}} presence of class 1 integrons and its invasiveness <b>of</b> Salmonella <b>panama</b> and Salmonella enteritidis isolated from children. MethodsTwenty S. panama and 59 S. enteritidis isolates were examined for minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline by agar dilution method. The presence of blaPSE- 1, floR, aadA 2, sul 1, and tet(G) resistance genes, class 1 integrons, and Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI 1) was identified by polymerase chain reaction. The adhesion and <b>invasion</b> assays <b>of</b> S. <b>panama</b> to Caco- 2 cells were determined using the pour plate method. ResultsAll S. panama and 15 (25. 4 %) of the S. enteritidis isolates displayed MDR phenotype. Furthermore, MDR genotype was present in 70. 0 % <b>of</b> S. <b>panama</b> and 6. 8 % of S. enteritidis. Class 1 integrons were present in 40. 0 % <b>of</b> S. <b>panama</b> and 11. 9 % of S. enteritidis. None contained SGI 1 or SGI 1 variants. Strains carrying class 1 integrons were more frequently isolated from bacteria with MDR (73. 3 % vs. 37. 5 %; odds ratio, 4. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 16. 0; p= 0. 01) and isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (46. 7 % vs. 21. 9 %; odds ratio, 3. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 10. 1; p= 0. 05) than noncarriers. S. panama carrying class 1 integrons were more invasive to Caco- 2 cells than those without (p= 0. 01). ConclusionS. panama and S. enteritidis with class 1 integrons are significantly related to the presence of MDR phenotype. Moreover, S. panama with class 1 integrons may present more invasiveness than those without...|$|R
