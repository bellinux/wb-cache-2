40|$|A {{range of}} {{exposure}} models, {{which have been}} developed in Europe and North America, are playing an increasingly important role in priority setting and the risk assessment of chemicals. However, the applicability of these tools, {{which are based on}} Western dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways,</b> to estimate chemical exposure to the Chinese population to support the development of a risk-based environment and exposure assessment, is unclear. Three frequently used modelling tools, EUSES, RAIDAR and ACC-HUMANsteady, have been evaluated in terms of human dietary exposure estimation by application to a range of chemicals with different physicochemical properties under both model default and Chinese dietary scenarios. Hence, the modelling approaches were assessed by considering dietary pattern differences only. The predicted dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> were compared under both scenarios using a range of hypothetical and current emerging contaminants. Although the differences across models are greater than those between dietary scenarios, model predictions indicated that dietary preference can {{have a significant impact on}} human exposure, with the relatively high consumption of vegetables and cereals resulting in higher exposure via plants-based foodstuffs under Chinese consumption patterns compared to Western diets. The selected models demonstrated a good ability to identify key dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> which can be used for screening purposes and an evaluative risk assessment.

40|$|Soil Screening Levels {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to be used in}} conjunction with vapor intrusion criteria and groundwater criteria for identifying sites posing a low-threat to human health. That is, these Soil Screening Levels are just one of three sets of criteria that should be evaluated to determine if a site is low-threat. The Soil Screening Levels discussed in this document have been developed for benzene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to define sites that are low-threat with respect to “direct contact ” with soil and inhalation of soil emissions. The <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> considered in the site conceptual model are: ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil and inhalation of dust and volatile emissions from soil. Note these <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> are assumed to occur simultaneously, i. e., the screening levels are protective of the cumulative exposure from all four <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways.</b> Standard USEPA risk assessment equations were used to derive the screening levels. The exposure parameter values, chemical toxicity values, and chemical fate and transport properties are based on standard values used in California.

40|$|Trace metals are {{available}} to marine bivalves through uptake from both the aqueous and dietary phases. In this study, I sought {{to determine if there}} is any interaction between these 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways.</b> The uptake of Cd and Se by green mussels Perna viridis from the aqueous phase Was measured at different phytoplankton concentrations (green alga Chlorella autotrophica). Controlled experiments were performed to ensure that, in the presence of algal particles, the majority of metal accumulation by the green mussels was due to uptake from the aqueous phase. The influx rate of metals was independent of the food concentration and the clearance rate of the mussels, indicating that metal uptake from the aqueous phase was not directly related to the food concentration. These results verify the assumption that metal uptake from different <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> is additive and that there is no direct interaction between different routes of exposure, Metal uptake by green mussels was further tested after exposing the mussels to neurotransmitters (serotonin which stimulates ciliary pumping and dopamine which inhibits ciliary pumping). Complete inhibition of ciliary pumping was reached after addition of 100 muM of dopamine, Despite changes in the pumping activity due to exposure to neurotransmitters, there was no evidence showing the reduction or enhancement of metal uptake. A bioenergetic-based kinetic model was then employed to model the influence of seston quantity on the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> of metals in the mussels, Our calculations indicated that the seston quantity substantially influences the relative importance of aqueous versus dietary exposure, primarily due to the dependence of a green mussel's ingestion activity on seston quantity. At a higher seston concentration, the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> are not influenced by the change in seston concentration due to the maintenance of a maximum ingestion rate and pseudofeces production...|$|R

40|$|The RESRAD-BUILD {{code was}} used to {{calculate}} the radiological dose from the contaminated concrete water tunnels at the 190 -C Area at the Hanford Site. Two exposure scenarios, recreationist and maintenance worker, were considered. A residential scenario was not considered because the material was assumed to be left intact (i. e., the concrete would not be rubbleized because the location would not be suitable for construction of a house). The recreationist was assumed to use the tunnel for 8 hours per day for 1 week as an overnight shelter. The maintenance worker was assumed to spend 20 hours per year working in the tunnel. Six <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> were considered in calculating the dose. Three external <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> involved penetrating radiation emitted directly from the contaminated tunnel floor, emitted from radioactive particulates deposited on the tunnel floor, and resulting from submersion in airborne radioactive particulates.
