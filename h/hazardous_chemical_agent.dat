It introduces basic information and data on industrial hazardous chemical substances and basic characteristics of chemical warfare agents. This thesis also deals with documentation related to solutions for emergency events in connection with <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> escape – type plans, methodical sheets. The work results in a proposal for another methodical sheet focused on interventions of concrete hazardous chemical substance escape, i. e. hydrogen chloride. In this way the proposal can extend the methodical sheets for chlorine and ammonia currently in use. This thesis also presents list of toxic chemical, industrial and warfare substances for working up another methodical sheets...|$|E
40|$|Recent world-wide {{terrorist}} events {{associated with}} the threat of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> proliferation, and outbreaks of chemical contamination in the food supply has demonstrated an urgent need for sensors that can directly detect the presence of dangerous chemical toxins. Such sensors must enable real-time detection and accurate identification of different classes of pesticides (e. g., carbamates and organophosphates) but must especially discriminate between widely used organophosphate (OP) pesticides and G- and V-type organophosphate chemical warfare nerve agents. Present field analytic sensors are bulky with limited specificity, require specially-trained personnel, and, in some cases, depend upon lengthy analysis time and specialized facilities. Most bioanalytical based systems are biomimetic. These sensors utilize sensitive enzyme recognition elements that are the in-vivo target of the neurotoxic agents which the sensor is attempting to detect. The strategy is well founded; if you want to detect cholinesterase toxins use cholinesterase receptors. However, this approach has multiple limitations. Cholinesterase receptors are sensitive {{to a wide range of}} non-related compounds and require lengthy incubation time. Cholinesterase sensors are inherently inhibition mode and therefore require baseline testing followed by sample exposure, retest and comparison to baseline. Finally, due to the irreversible nature of enzyme-ligand interactions, inhibition-mode sensors cannot be reused without regeneration of enzyme activity, which in many cases is inefficient and time-consuming.

40|$|When a <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> has soaked into a porous medium, such as concrete, {{it can be}} {{difficult}} to neutralise. One removal method is chemical decontamination, where a cleanser is applied to react with and neutralise the agent, forming less harmful reaction products. There are often several cleansers that could be used to neutralise the same agent, so it is important to identify the cleanser features associated with fast and effective decontamination. As many cleansers are aqueous solutions while many agents are immiscible with water, the decontamination reaction often takes place at the interface between two phases. In this paper, we develop and analyse a mathematical model of a decontamination reaction between a neat agent and an immiscible cleanser solution. We assume that the reaction product is soluble in both the cleanser phase and the agent phase. At the moving boundary between the two phases, we obtain coupling conditions from mass conservation arguments and the oil–water partition coefficient of the product. We analyse our model using both asymptotic and numerical methods, and investigate how different features of a cleanser affect the time taken to remove the agent. Our results reveal the existence of two regimes characterised by different rate-limiting transport processes, and we identify the key parameters that control the removal time in each regime. In particular, we find that the oil–water partition coefficient of the reaction product is significantly more important in determining the removal time than the effective reaction rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> and carcinogens/mutagens in unsaturated soil and/or groundwater, or {{their use in}} clean-up activities, doesn’t necessarily entail a risk to human health. It depends on the toxicological characteristics, the concentration of the substance, the transport mechanisms and the exposure media. In Italy, the management of chemical risk to workers’ health in contaminated sites is currently not standardized. For this reason, in 2013 a team of experts {{in the management of}} contamination sites and of occupational risks, coordinated by INAIL, began to work out a document dealing with the operative instructions to protect the health of workers present for any reason in a contaminated site. This document addresses the main aspects related to the protection of workers exposed to contaminants considering both the toxic and the carcinogenic effects of chemicals. In this paper a particular issue, addressed in the document, is discussed: the proposed methodology to check the {{presence of}} <b>chemical</b> and carcinogen/mutagen <b>agents</b> at workplace for the inhalation exposure pathway...|$|R

40|$|We outline {{methods for}} {{integrating}} epidemiologic and industrial hygiene data {{systems for the}} purpose of exposure estimation, exposure surveillance, worker notification, and occupational medicine practice. We present examples of these methods from our work at the Rocky Flats Plant?a former nuclear weapons facility that fabricated plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons and is now being decontaminated and decommissioned. The weapons production processes exposed workers to plutonium, gamma photons, neutrons, beryllium, asbestos, and several <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents,</b> including chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals. We developed a job exposure matrix (JEM) for estimating exposures to 10 <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> in 20 buildings for 120 different job categories over a production history spanning 34 years. With the JEM, we estimated lifetime chemical exposures for about 12, 000 of the 16, 000 former production workers. We show how the JEM database is used to estimate cumulative exposures over different time periods for epidemiological studies and to provide notification and determine eligibility for a medical screening program developed for former workers. We designed an industrial hygiene data system for maintaining exposure data for current cleanup workers. We describe how this system can be used for exposure surveillance and linked with the JEM and databases on radiation doses to develop lifetime exposure histories and to determine appropriate medical monitoring tests for current cleanup workers. We also present time-line-based graphical methods for reviewing and correcting exposure estimates and reporting them to individual workers...|$|R
40|$|Antineoplastic {{drugs are}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> used {{mostly in the}} {{treatment}} of patients with cancer, however health professionals that handle and administer these drugs can become exposed and develop DNA damage. Comet assay is a standard method for assessing DNA damage in human biomonitoring and, combined with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) enzyme, it specifically detects DNA oxidative damage. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate genotoxic effects in workers occupationally exposed to cytostatics (n = 46), as compared to a control group with no exposure (n = 46) at two Portuguese hospitals, by means of the alkaline comet assay. The potential of the OGG 1 Ser 326 Cys polymorphism as a susceptibility biomarker was also investigated. Exposure was evaluated by investigating the contamination of surfaces and genotoxic assessment was done by alkaline comet assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes. OGG 1 Ser 326 Cys (rs 1052133) polymorphism was studied by Real Time PCR. As for exposure assessment, there were 121 (37 %) positive samples out of a total of 327 samples analysed from both hospitals. No statistically significant differences (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0. 05) were found between subjects with and without exposure, regarding DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage, nevertheless the exposed group exhibited higher values. Moreover, there was no consistent trend regarding the variation of both biomarkers as assessed by comet assay with OGG 1 polymorphism. Our study was not statistically significant regarding occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs and genetic damage assessed by comet assay. However, health professionals should be monitored for risk behaviour, in order to ensure that safety measures are applied and protection devices are used correctly...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the first known}} the use of electrokinetic treatments and ionic salt washes to remediate concrete contaminated with 137 Cs. A series of experiments were performed on concrete samples, contaminated with K+ and 137 Cs, using a bespoke migration cell and an applied electric field (60 V potential gradient and current limit of 35 mA). Additionally, two samples were treated with an ionic salt wash (≤ 400 mol m− 3 of KCl) alongside the electrokinetic treatment. The {{results show that the}} combined treatment produces removal efficiencies three times higher (> 60 %) than the electrokinetic treatment alone and that the decontamination efficiency appears to be proportional to the initial degree of contamination. Furthermore, the decontamination efficiencies are equivalent to previous electrokinetic studies that utilised <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> enhancement <b>agents</b> demonstrating the potential of the technique for use on nuclear licensed site. The results highlight the relationship between the initial contamination concentration within the concrete and achievable removal efficiency of electrokinetic treatment and other treatments.

Particles may represent customers or jobs in a queueing system, contaminants in a physical system, <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> or biological <b>agents</b> in an environmental system, standing buy/sell orders at a brokerage center, etc. This class of stochastic systems is modeled and analyzed. We (i) derive the joint transform of the time-to-first-detection {{and the number of}} particles present in the system at that epoch, and compute their statistics; (ii) define and calculate various path-functionals and performance measures of the system; and, (iii) study the issue of optimal monitoring schemes...|$|R

40|$|Silent {{electrical}} discharge plasma (dielectric barrier) reactors can decompose gas-phase pollutants by free-radical {{attack or}} electron-induced fragmentation. The radicals or electrons {{are produced by}} the large average volume nonthermal plasmas generated in the reactor. In the past decade, the barrier configuration has attracted attention for destroying toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> for the military, removing harmful greenhouse gases, and treating other environmentally- <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds. At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, {{we have been studying}} the silent discharge plasma (SDP) for processing gaseous-based <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals</b> for approximately five years. The key objective is to convert <b>hazardous</b> or toxic <b>chemicals</b> into non-hazardous compounds or into materials which are more easily managed. The main applications have been for treating off-gases from thermal treatment units, and for abating hazardous air-pollutant emissions (e. g., industrial air emissions, vapors extracted from contaminated soil or groundwater). In this paper, we will summarize the basic principles of SDP processing, discuss illustrative applications of the technology, and present results from small-scale field tests that are relevant to our commercialization effort...|$|R

30|$|Gills are {{the primary}} site for any {{histological}} alteration as it is directly exposed to polluted water. In our present study, the structure of gills {{in the control group}} was almost normal. Primary and secondary gill lamellae were found with no pathology (Figure  2 e). Moderate to severe structural changes with mentionable pathological signs were observed in the gills of treated fish including missing secondary gill lamellae, hemorrhage, necrosis, hyperplasia and hypertrophy, gill clubbing, and fungal granuloma (Figure  2 f,g,h). Disruption in gill structure and function possibly due to various environmental factors, pH, ion concentration, heavy metals, and other pollutants were previously described (Tkatcheva et al. 2004; Peuranen et al. 2000; Playle 1998). Thickening and lifting of the secondary lamellar epithelium due to hypertrophy are the first signs that gills have been exposed to <b>hazardous</b> <b>chemicals,</b> or physical <b>agents</b> may have been a response to increase the diffusion distance between DO and blood, which accordingly was related to hypoxia in fish (Liu et al. 2010). Gill clubbing is due to excess mucus production. In the presence of pollutants, the epithelium of the secondary lamellae has a tendency {{to increase the number of}} mucus cell. Excess mucus from mucus cell causes the fusion of secondary gill lamellae resulting in impaired respiration.|$|R

40|$|In July 1988, {{the state}} of Utah issued {{regulations}} that declared residues resulting from the demilitarization, treatment, and testing of military <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> to be <b>hazardous</b> wastes. These residues were designated as corrosive, reactive, toxic, and acute hazardous (Hazardous Waste No. F 999). These residues are not listed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which is the primary law governing management of hazardous waste in the United States.
