Clifford Geertz described this as abangan and priyayi, [...] "the lower class and elite varieties of Javanese syncretism".|$|R

5|$|Although <b>Islam</b> <b>is</b> the {{official}} {{religion of the}} federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although <b>Islam</b> <b>is</b> the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. <b>Islam</b> <b>is</b> the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries.

5|$|<b>Islam</b> <b>is</b> also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in <b>Islam</b> <b>is</b> the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
