5|$|An {{alternative}} view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the formal}} {{structure of the}} Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but {{the presence of a}} practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E

25|$|Let me {{assure you}} that King's work most {{definitely}} is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.|$|E

50|$|In 1854 Charles Marshall {{named his}} leased {{pastoral}} selection Moura. There are two theories regarding {{the origin of}} the name.

50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simple and inexpensive. A major dis{{advantage of}} the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> restricted to mice and limited to strains that do not tend to climb their tail. Besides, like FST, TST is sensitive to acute treatment only, and its validity for non-monoamine antidepressants is uncertain.|$|R
25|$|The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet {{possible}} to know precisely where Zhenyuanlongs closest phylogenetic affinities lie.

25|$|With {{reference}} to the pro-nuclear film Pandora's Promise, economics professor, John Quiggin, comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> economically viable. Quiggin says that we need {{more efficient energy use}} and more renewable energy commercialization.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography {{can help}} detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress {{echocardiography}} {{may also help}} determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease.

40|$|Extract: When I {{first started}} looking at Human Resource Auditing the {{prevailing}} view <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good for ensuring <b>that</b> all {{of the components of}} a human resources program were in place and operating correctly.

25|$|A {{characteristic}} of electricity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts {{and it must}} be produced. Production is carried out in power plants. Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} with antenna systems {{of this sort}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{possible}} {{to know if the}} signal is being received by the front or back of the antenna, which are equally sensitive. To address this, once a null was seen, the bearing operator turned on a sensing switch which connected a second antenna located slightly behind the main one. The mixed output of the two clearly indicated which side the target lay on, front or rear. However, this led to problems in the phasing systems that were never wholly cured.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of string theory from early on <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> manifestly {{background}} independent. In string theory, one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book The Trouble With Physics, physicist Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics claims {{that this is the}} principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|The {{outstanding}} {{problem with}} NF <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{known to be}} relatively consistent to any mainstream mathematical system. NF disproves Choice, and so proves Infinity (Specker, 1953). But it is also known (Jensen, 1969) that allowing urelements (multiple distinct objects lacking members) yields NFU, a theory that is consistent relative to Peano arithmetic; if Infinity and Choice are added, the resulting theory has the same consistency strength as type theory with infinity or bounded Zermelo set theory. (NFU corresponds to a type theory TSTU, where type 0 has urelements, not just a single empty set.) There are other relatively consistent variants of NF.|$|E
25|$|The obvious {{drawback}} of {{the system}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> compatible with Europlugs. As household appliances were never sold fitted with these security plugs {{and the use of}} adaptors would defeat all of the newly introduced safety features, once this system is adopted all standard plugs must be cut off and replaced with the appropriate security connector. However, the Magic security system had some success at first because its enhanced safety features appealed to customers; standard connectors of the day were considered not safe enough. The decline {{of the system}} occurred when safety lids similar to the Magic type were developed (VIMAR Sicury) and then applied to standard sockets by third brands and by BTicino itself.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a valuable ring {{which happens to}} <b>be</b> lost. <b>Its</b> inherent condition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> valuable and so has lots of essential dignity. However, its current state <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> lost and so has little accidental dignity. The significator for the ring in this horary might, for example, be Venus in Taurus (good essential dignity) but retrograde and combust (accidentally debilitated).|$|R

25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of intercalation fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists {{have dealt with the}} issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major downside of this approach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.|$|E
25|$|However, whilst the {{rationale}} behind the equation is sound, {{it is unlikely that}} the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usable to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it.|$|E
25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{one of the first things}} that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

25|$|The {{provision}} of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The {{main reason for}} this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK since the Second World War, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium is the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. London's largest athletics venue is Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. It will be superseded by the Olympic Stadium, which will be built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but {{will most likely be}} reduced to 60,000 seats after the Games with the London organising committee's decision to accept West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics and there is also the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events.|$|E

By the time West Ham moved in, the capacity was reduced to 60,000, and the track remained in place, with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. Since the retention of the track was {{a necessary condition for}} tenancy, the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.|$|E
