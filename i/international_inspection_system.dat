40|$|<b>International</b> audienceAn {{ultrasonic}} <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> {{involves the}} generation, propagation and reception of short transient signals. Piezoelectric transducers and particularly phased arrays are increasingly used in ultrasonic Non Destructive Testing (NDT) {{because of their}} ability to focus or deflect an ultrasonic beam in parts of complex geometries. To accurately model the sensitivity in transmission and reception of such sensors, a transient Finite Element (FE) model has been developed including not only piezoelectric effects but also all electrical elements such as pulser/receiver system and cabling. A particular attention is devoted to the different boundary conditions used to model the emission and reception regimes of the sensor. The definition of the inspection domain is made easier by a decomposition domain technique allowing, in the same time, local time stepping and efficient absorbing layers to optimize calculation cost. In order to illustrate all the capabilities of this simulation tool, several cases of NDT inspections are then presented through the analysis of the ultrasonic beam snapshots and the electrical signal read on the receiver...|$|R
40|$|As a {{means of}} transport, the railway is gaining in importance, and this has {{inspired}} {{a large number of}} innovations. International rail traffic, for example, and logistics solutions need to be improved, but technical safety must also be guaranteed, especially for high-speed trains. Reliability and availability of high-speed trains depends significantly on the quality of wheels, wheel sets and wheel set axles. There are, indeed, already a large number of national and international rules and regulations, for example on the inspection of wheels, wheel sets and tracks, which take this into account. European and – not least – Fraunhofer research together with industrial partners have assumed a leading role in this process, resulting in <b>international</b> demand for <b>inspection</b> <b>systems</b> developed in Europe.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} an innovative surface <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> for automated quality control for steel productions in POSCO. We had ever installed the various kinds of surface <b>inspection</b> <b>systems,</b> such as a linear CCD and a laser typed surface <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> at cold rolled strip production lines. But these systems cannot fulfill the sufficient detection and classification rate, and real time processing performance. In order to increase detection and classification rate, we have used the Dark, Bright and Transition field illumination and area type CCD camera, and for the real time image processing, parallel computing has been used. In this paper, we introduce the automatic surface <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and real time image processing technique using the object detection, defect detection, classification algorithm and its performance obtained at the production line.

40|$|Today’s {{production}} processes {{are more and}} more optimized to be competitive. The production demands are increased for speed and quality. These increased demands do not pass the roll shops in the steel industry. In the roll shop periodically the rolls from the rolling mill are checked for imperfections. The imperfections are detected by special <b>inspection</b> <b>systems.</b> Improving the <b>inspection</b> <b>systems</b> can speed up the overall process significantly in the roll shop. The request for an improved <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> results in a new generation <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> should measure more signals {{at the same time and}} process the signals faster. To achieve this result the measurements are digitalized and processed in parallel on a FPGA. Speed and quality demands are also asked from the engineers by designing and maintanance of the <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> In this thesis a High-Level Synthesis tool is selected to implement the mathematical model of the <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> The tool selection is done based on a comparison between three HLS tools, namely: CatapultC, ROCCC and Compaan. For this implementation Compaan is the most promising one. Compaan is able to split the data streams processing in concurrent systems with distributed memories. With Compaan as development tool the main part of the mathematical model is implemented in four months. This is four times faster than the preceding implementation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an alternative}} approach to the camber angle measurement for vehicle wheel alignment. Instead of current commercial approaches that apply computation vision techniques, this study aims at realizing a micro-control-unit (MCU) -based camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> with a 3 -axis accelerometer. We analyze the precision of the <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> for the axis misalignments of the accelerometer. The {{results show that the}} axes of the accelerometer can be aligned to the axes of the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> imperfectly. The calibrations that can amend these axis misalignments between the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and the accelerometer are also originally proposed since misalignments will usually happen in fabrications of the <b>inspection</b> <b>systems.</b> During camber angle measurements, the x-axis or z-axis of the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and the wheel need not be perfectly aligned in the proposed approach. We accomplished two typical authentic camber angle measurements. The results show that the proposed approach is applicable with a precision of ± 0. 015 ∘ and therefore facilitates the camber measurement process without downgrading the precision by employing an appropriate 3 -axis accelerometer. In addition, the measured results of camber angles can be transmitted via the medium such as RS 232, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi...|$|R
