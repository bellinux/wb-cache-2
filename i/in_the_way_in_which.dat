5|$|Arctic Monkeys are a British indie {{rock band}} from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys {{currently}} consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were heralded {{as one of}} the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills {{of rights and}} English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> peace and war were distinguished (including {{the possibility of a}} situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{framework}} of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are {{beyond the control of}} the individual, which accounts for the consistency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions—and this quality of emotional control was passed to their Nisei children.|$|E
25|$|Millikan's {{enthusiasm for}} {{education}} continued throughout his career, {{and he was}} the coauthor of a popular and influential series of introductory textbooks, which were ahead of their time in many ways. Compared to other books of the time, they treated the subject more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was thought about by physicists. They also included many homework problems that asked conceptual questions, rather than simply requiring the student to plug numbers into a formula.|$|E
25|$|The strict {{constructive}} ordering {{that had}} become so pronounced in Metzinger's pre-1920 Cubist works continued throughout the subsequent decades, in the careful positioning of form, color, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Metzinger delicately assimilates the union of figure and background, of light and shadow. This {{can be seen in}} many figures: From the division (in two) of the model's features emerges a subtle profile view—resulting from a free and mobile perspective used by Metzinger to some extent as early as 1908 to constitute the image of a whole—one that includes the fourth dimension.|$|E

25|$|The picture target {{experiments}} that {{were conducted by}} Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses {{in the design of}} the experiments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.|$|E
25|$|Batoo is {{a modern}} Korean variant. The name stems from a {{combination}} of the Korean words baduk and juntoo (“battle”). It is played entirely in cyberspace, and differs from standard Go in a number of ways, most noticeably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> certain areas of the board are worth different points values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. Batoo became a short-lived fad among young people in Korea around 2011.|$|E
25|$|The nude figure sitting to the left, {{the horse}} {{standing}} to the right, {{along with other}} elements of the painting are depicted in a faceted manner, based to some extent on non-Euclidean geometry. Denying the illusion of Renaissance perspective the artist breaks down the figures and background into facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the subject all at once. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, form and color, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Metzinger assimilates the union of the background, woman and horse. For example, the division of the model's features generates a subtle profile view, the vase is shown both from above and the side.|$|E

25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to worsted yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning worsted yarns is the worsted mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a major}} {{difference}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> different bowlers or pitchers contribute to a single game. In baseball, a single pitcher starts the game, and makes every pitch until the manager replaces the tiring pitcher with a relief pitcher. Replaced pitchers cannot return to pitch again in the same game (unless they are shuttled to another position {{in the field and}} thus stay in the line-up, a move rarely seen in the major leagues), and a succession of pitchers may come into the game in sequence until it ends. In cricket, two bowlers begin the game, with those not actively bowling spending time as fielders. Every player in the team, including the wicket-keeper but excluding the 12th man, is available {{to be used as a}} bowler. Bowlers alternate bowling overs of six balls each. A bowler will usually bowl for a 'spell' of several (alternate) overs, and will generally bowl the entire spell from the same end of the pitch. A second bowler will bowl the overs missed by the first, from the other end of the pitch, for his own spell. After a bowler is taken off, he may be, and often is, asked to bowl another spell later in the same innings. Although moving a pitcher to a fielding position and returning him to pitch later in the game is legal in baseball, it is a rarely used and potentially risky strategy, as the pitcher may be unprepared to play another position.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E

500|$|The {{period between}} 1950 and 1975 saw major changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> history and {{literature}} were approached {{in terms of}} interpretation and writing. It also produced {{a change in the}} self perception of Spanish American novelists [...] The development of the cities, the coming of age of a large middle class, the Cuban Revolution, the Alliance for Progress, an increase in communication between the countries of Latin America, the greater importance of the mass media, and a greater attention to Latin America from Europe and the United States all contributed to this change. The most important political events of the period were the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the Chilean coup d'état in 1973. [...] The fall of General Perón in Argentina, the protracted violent struggle of the urban guerrillas, brutally repressed in Argentina and Uruguay, and the unending violence in Colombia also affected writers, as they generated explanations, or testimonies, or provided a troubling background for their work.|$|E
