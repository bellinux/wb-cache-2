5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious actors sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and {{they were to be}} granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a <b>deputy</b> <b>manager</b> of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Muller {{was destined}} to step into his father's {{footsteps}} and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the Hohe Real Schule in Frankfurt-am-Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At {{the end of his}} trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as <b>deputy</b> <b>manager</b> in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deputy</b> <b>managers</b> and {{the chief}} {{accountant}} belong to the so-called inner-circle management of an enterprise. Their legal position is specifically connected with {{the legal status of}} the manager of an enterprise. The manager is an organ of an enterprise and he is equipped with all managing powers with the exception of those reserved for the organs of the self-goverment of the crew. Therefore the tasks, and especially the powers of <b>deputy</b> <b>managers</b> {{and the chief}} accountant are always derivative of the manager's powers. The latter defines the range of tasks and powers of <b>deputy</b> <b>managers</b> in organizational regulation, relegating to his deputies a part of his own tasks and duties together with the responsibility for carring them out. Because of this the legal position of <b>deputy</b> <b>managers</b> is to some extent similar to the position of plenipotentiaries of an enterprise. Somewhat different is the way of defining the tasks, rights and duties of the chief accountant in an enterprise. In that case some tasks and powers which may be carried out exclusively by the chief accountant are defined directly in legal provisions. <b>Deputy</b> <b>managers</b> as well as the chief accountant are appointed by virtue of the manager's decision with the prior consent of the employees' council. The same procedure applies to the removal of <b>deputy</b> <b>managers</b> and the chief accountant. However, the content of the employment relationship of those persons is defined solely by the manager. He is also their service superior and he is equipped with powers to apply sanctions within the system of liability for order transgressions. Thus, the employment status of <b>deputy</b> <b>managers</b> and the chief accountant differs considerably from the one of the manager of an enterprise and is much closer to the legal position of other employees, with exceptions defined in Art. 69 of the Labour Code.
