50|$|The Škorpion is a select-fire, {{straight}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} fires from the closed bolt position. The cartridge used produces {{a very low}} recoil impulse and this enables simple unlocked blowback operation to be employed; there is no delay mechanism and the cartridge is supported only by the inertia of the bolt {{and the strength of}} the return springs. When fired, gas pressure drives the case back in the chamber against the resistance provided by the weight of the bolt and its two recoil springs. The bolt travels back, extracting the empty case which is then ejected straight upwards through a port in the receiver <b>housing</b> <b>top</b> cover.|$|E
40|$|A captive {{fastener}} device is utilized to hold two members together. The device {{is comprised of}} a housing which may be securely attached to the first member. Within the housing is a spring which biases a bottom of a first lip of a cup washer. The top of the first lip contacts {{the top of the}} housing when the fastener is not engaged. The fastener has a ledge {{at the bottom of the}} fastener head which rests on a top surface of a second lip of the cup washer. The bottom surface of the second lip contacts the first member when the fastener has fully engaged the second member to secure the first and second members together. The first lip of the cup washer has a greater diameter than the second lip. The first lip also has a greater diameter than the fastener. When the fastener is not engaged, a top surface of the first lip engages a bottom surface of the top of the housing. The <b>housing</b> <b>top</b> has an access hole of smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the fastener head which retains the fastener within the housing when the fastener is not engaging the second member...|$|E
40|$|An Oil filter is {{a filter}} to remove {{contaminants}} from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil filter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of oil filters. And oil production, transport, and recycling facilities employ filters. Parts of the hydraulic oil filter in our project are piston housing, shaft <b>housing,</b> <b>top</b> plate, crankshaft, and piston. The aim of the project is to model and design casting tool for piston housing which is used in a hydraulic oil filter pump having pressure 50 kg/cm 2, and temperature rating 300 deg C. In casting tool, we are designing core cavity, mould base plates. Calculations are to be done for cavity fill time, cavity fill rate, gate area, runner area, shot weight, die cooling calculations. CNC programming for core and cavity is to be done and for remaining manufacturing processes are to be done...|$|E
