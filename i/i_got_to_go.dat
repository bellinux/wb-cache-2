25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes.

60|$|No love {{where there}} is any guilt! O God, How {{differently}} do we love from men! There is many a woman here in Padua, Some workman's wife, or ruder artisan's, Whose husband spends the wages of the week In a coarse revel, or a tavern brawl, And reeling home late on the Saturday night, Finds his wife sitting by a fireless hearth, Trying to hush the child who cries for hunger, And then sets to and beats his wife because The child is hungry, and the fire black. Yet the wife loves him! and will rise next day With some red bruise across a careworn face, And sweep the house, and do the common service, And try and smile, and only be too glad If he does not beat her a second time Before her child!--that is how women love. [A pause: GUIDO says nothing.] I think you will not drive me from your side. Where have <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> if you reject me? - You for whose sake this hand has murdered life, You for whose sake my soul has wrecked itself Beyond all hope of pardon.|$|E
