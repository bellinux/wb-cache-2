5|$|Due to {{differences}} among the three species, each has been placed within a different genus, each consisting of one species. In the older literature, these three genera were placed within a family of their own, Desmodontidae, but taxonomists <b>have</b> <b>now</b> grouped them as a subfamily, the Desmodontinae, in the leaf-nosed bat family, Phyllostomidae.|$|E
5|$|Four 2-figure sets {{have been}} {{released}}: Sarah Jane and Star Poet; Sarah Jane and General Kudlak; Sarah Jane and Child Slitheen and Sarah Jane and Graske.

5|$|Hazlitt's {{ideas about}} {{many of the}} plays <b>have</b> <b>now</b> come to be valued as thought-provoking {{alternatives}} to those of his contemporary Coleridge, and Characters of Shakespear's Plays is now viewed as a major study of Shakespeare's plays, placing Hazlitt with Schlegel and Coleridge {{as one of the}} three most notable Shakespearean critics of the Romantic period.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these elements {{are known to be}} asymmetric while others overlap.|$|E
5|$|Over 1000serpins <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been identified, {{including}} 36human proteins, {{as well as}} {{molecules in}} all kingdoms of life—animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea—and some viruses. In the 2000s, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin superfamily based on their evolutionary relationships. Serpins are therefore {{the largest and most}} diverse superfamily of protease inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the former}} meat market {{buildings}} <b>have</b> <b>now</b> changed use. For example, the former Central Cold Store, on Charterhouse Street is now, most unusually, a City centre cogeneration power station operated by Citigen.

5|$|The {{city had}} {{extensive}} walls built by Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances. These <b>have</b> <b>now</b> largely disappeared, although parts remain on properties in King Street. A gateway {{in the old}} wall can now be seen under the tower of the Church of St John the Baptist.|$|E

5|$|The {{other type}} was the mainland; these {{tended to be}} larger because their {{pastures}} provided richer nutrients. They came {{in a range of}} colours, most frequently dun or red. These types <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been crossbred so that there is no distinct difference.|$|E
5|$|Variations include Gropecunte, Gropecountelane, Gropecontelane, Groppecountelane and Gropekuntelane. There {{were once}} many such street names in England, but all <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been bowdlerised. In {{the city of}} York, for instance, Grapcunt Lane—grāp is the Old English word for grope—was renamed as the more {{acceptable}} Grape Lane.|$|E

5|$|Virtually all {{officers}} <b>have</b> <b>now</b> changed positions, {{but this}} list gives {{an outline of}} the structure in January 2005. Despite the planned subdivision of the country into more numerous provinces, the actual splitting of the former provinces has not taken place.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these <b>have</b> <b>now</b> {{been placed in}} a separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg is North Jutland's major {{industrial}} and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement, and spirits. Heavy industry {{was behind the}} city's prosperity until fairly recently.

Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown substantially since the 1990s, as has rotor production for wind turbines.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
