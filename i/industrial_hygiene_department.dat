According to DOSH, of more than 700 premises and another 600 odd outlets inspected for <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> recently, "almost all were given between two weeks and two months {{to abide by the}} regulations" (MM, Nov 13).

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the scope of ergonomics in relation to the discipline of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Background: There has been increasing recognition of the importance of ergonomics in the practice of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene.</b> As a result, quite a number of ergonomics-related research articles have been published in major <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> journals. And the professional engineers in <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> have conducted ergonomics-related activities. Method: This paper reports the results from the literature review of the ergonomics papers published in major <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> journals for the last 5 years, and the certification of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> and ergonomics. Results: It was found that 7. 7 ~ 13 % of the total published papers were about ergonomics, and the number of the professional engineers in <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> is almost double of that of ergonomics. Conclusion: It should be understood that the work of ergonomic is complementary to <b>industrial</b> <b>hygiene</b> and not in competition with it. Application: Some suggestions were proposed hopefully helpful to colleagu...|$|R
