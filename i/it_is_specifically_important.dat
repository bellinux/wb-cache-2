Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models are able to provide more detailed information than traditional LCA approaches.

Community nurses {{have a very}} {{important}} role to play in the planning of health promotion programmes and implementation of the necessary interventions for patients and groups with obesity problems. Obesity is one of the health problems that requires signficant behavioural changes in one's lifestyle as part of such interventions. The research study sought to explore the perceptions of both the patients and the community nurses of the phenomenon of obesity as a health risk, and to identify any areas that could give rise to problems when health promotion actions were planned for obese people. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>important</b> to obtain the perceptions of the community nurse of obesity, since the level of knowledge of the health problem as well as her personal attitude towards this problem, will be crucial in the manner and quality of her interventions. The study explored patients' and nurses' perceptions about obesity as a health risk (Phase I and 2). Factors in the internal and external environments of the obese individual were identified and analysed into categories and subcategories. The study is qualitative and explorative in nature, data was collected through the use of semistructured interviews, and Giorgi's method of data analysis was used. Literature control was done to examine how existing literature compared with data obtained from semistructured interviews on the nature of obesity as a health problem. Obesity is clearly a health risk and affects the person's totality of life experiences as demonstrated by the resultant patterns of interactions between the internal and external environments of an obese person. Results of the data analysis and literature control gave rise to the need to structure recommendations to give the community nurse the capacity and support that was identified as necessary for her to be able to carry out her nursing intervention...|$|R

This is because of the diversity of data standards, specifications and arrangements which have been utilized by organizations. Data providers adopt spatial data standards and specifications and establish data sharing arrangement based on their requirements which may differ form other organizations. Therefore, multi-source spatial datasets are associated with technical and non-technical inconsistency and heterogeneity. In order to facilitate the integration of multi-source spatial datasets, the investigation of the data integration process, potential barriers and challenges of spatial data integration and possible enablers and solutions is necessary. This paper aims to provide an investigation on the spatial data integration as a compelling reason for spatial data sharing. The investigation approach is based on a number of case studies. The case study investigation has also highlighted and identified a number of technical and non-technical barriers and issues of multi-source spatial data integration. The paper also capitalizes on the analysis of the case study investigation to identify the possible tools, solutions and enablers which can be utilized to facilitate the integration of multi-source datasets. In this regard, the paper presents a spatial data integration toolbox. The toolbox consists of a number of components including spatial data validation and integration tool, associated guidelines; and data integration metadata and data specification documents. The design and development of a spatial data validation and integration tool and associated guidelines have also been presented in the paper. 15 - 19 June 2009 Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{purpose of}} this study was to make a {{contribution}} towards decision–making in complex environmental problems, especially where data is limited and associated with a high degree of uncertainty. As a young scientist, I understood the value of science as a measuring and quantification tool and used to intuitively believe that science was exact and could provide undisputable answers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> in 1997, during the Safety Assessments done at the Vaalputs National Radioactive Waste Repository that my belief system was challenged. This occurred after there were numerous scientific studies done on the site that was started since the early 1980 ’s, yet with no conclusion as to how safe the site is in terms of radioactive waste disposal. The Safety Assessment process was developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to transform the scientific investigations and data into decision–making information for the purposes of radioactive waste management. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also during the Vaalputs investigations when I learned the value of lateral thinking. There were numerous scientists with doctorate and master’s degrees that worked on the site of which I was one. One of the important requirements was to measure evaporation at the local weather station close to the repository. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>important</b> to measure evaporation as a controlling parameter in the unsaturated zone models. Evaporation was measured with an Apan that is filled with water so that the losses can be measured. Vaalputs is a very dry place and water is scarce. The local weather station site was fenced off, but there was a problem in that the aardvark dug below the fence and drank the water in the A–pan, so that no measurements were possible. The solution from the scientists was to put the fence deeper into the ground. The aardvark did not find it hard to dig even deeper. The next solution was to put a second fence around the weather station and again the aardvark dug below it to drink the water. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> then that Mr Robbie Schoeman, a technician became aware of the problem and put a drinking water container outside the weather station fence for the aardvark and – the problem was solved at a fraction of the cost of the previous complex solutions. I get in contact with the same thinking patterns that intuitively expect that the act of scientific investigations will provide decision–making information or even solve the problem. If the investigation provides more questions than answers, the quest is for more and more data on more detailed scales. There is a difference between problem characterization and solution viidentification. Problem characterization requires scientific and critical thinking, which is an important component but that has to be incorporated with the solution identification process of creative thinking towards decision–making. I am a scientist by heart, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to realise that apart from research, practical science must feed into a higher process, such as decision–making to be able to make a practical difference. The process of compilation of this thesis meant a lot to me as I initially thought of doing a PhD and then it changed me, especially in the way I think. This was a life changing process, which is good. As Jesus said in Mathew 3 : 2 And saying, Repent (think differently; change your mind, regretting your sins and changing your conduct), for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Doctora...|$|R
