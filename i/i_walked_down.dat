5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> Seventh Avenue and saw {{grown men}} weeping like children, and women {{sitting in the}} curbs with their head in their hands. All {{across the country that}} night when the news came that Joe was knocked out, people cried.|$|E
25|$|As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> at {{this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E

500|$|She was {{referred}} to as a [...] "young activist in the Maryhill Branch of the ILP", before she joined the WSPU in 1909, aged 16. She was the youngest member of the WSPU Glasgow delegation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George in 1912. As a member of the WSPU and organiser of the Domestic Workers' Union, she led the first of the [...] "Scottish Outrages", involving attacks on pillar boxes, in Glasgow in February 1913. Stephen's job as a maid worked in her favour during these attacks, as she explained in a 1975 interview:"I was able to drop acid into the postal pillar boxes without being suspected, because <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> from where I was employed in my cap, muslin apron and black frock... nobody would ever suspect me of dropping acid through the box."Stephen was approached by Sylvia Pankhurst and moved from Glasgow to London, where she became considered one of the [...] "most active members" [...] (along with Emma Boyce, around 1916) of the Workers' Suffrage Federation. In April 1919, Stephen was {{one of a number of}} speakers to address a crowd of [...] "about 10,000 people" [...] in Trafalgar Square, opposing the Blockade of Germany. Other speakers included Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Theodora Wilson Wilson. She was also an active member of the Women's Peace Crusade and at the 1920 ILP conference argued against the use of force during events preceding the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR.|$|E
2500|$|Joplin {{attended}} {{her high}} school reunion on August 14, accompanied by Neuwirth, road manager John Cooke, and sister Laura, but it was reportedly an unhappy experience for her. Joplin {{held a press conference}} in Port Arthur during her reunion visit. Rolling Stone journalist Chet Flippo reported that she wore enough jewelry for a [...] "Babylonian whore". When asked by a reporter if she ever entertained at Thomas Jefferson High School when she was a student there, Joplin replied, [...] "Only when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisles." [...] Joplin denigrated Port Arthur and the classmates who had humiliated her a decade earlier.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle brandishing my daisies." ...|$|E

Libby Jo and I are setting to sea, not ten miles from the Arctic Circle. My five-month-old and I are in northern Iceland, as part of a research trip for my PhD novel...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Closerstil {{had some}} fellow looking at me; why, <b>I</b> can't <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> that town without having my very steps counted. I like sharp {{fighting}} myself, but I never go so sharp as that." ...|$|R
60|$|Jumping {{over the}} fence, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> the road, {{but not in}} hopes of meeting John Stumpy. If he was {{anywhere}} near, {{the approach of the}} two boys had certainly driven him into hiding.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{the street}} and left him looking after me. At the corner I glanced around. The {{proprietor}} and the commissionnaire were talking together on the pavement.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{gathering}} of people was held {{off by the}} police. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> [...] <b>down</b> with C., and as a large crowd gathered, though in the main [...] friendly, we went into Dr. Clark’s, {{and then in a}} hansom off the [...] ground.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't go,' said Marie. 'No, mamma, he shan't go. What has he to {{be afraid}} of? <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> among them into papa's room, and say that I will never marry that man, {{and that this is}} my lover. Felix, will you come?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was fine, ma'am, that I know. For <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> with nurse, {{and little}} Miss Primrose into Silverton, {{to help to}} carry her in case she was tired, and we never had {{occasion}} to put up an umbrella.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A weird tremor broke over me. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} street and bought a paper. There it stared me in the face on the middle page: [...] "Tragedy at Campden Hill: Well-known Barrister Murders his Wife. Sensational Details." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{introductions}} {{and explanations}} had filled up the time whilst my two Krooboys {{were making the}} dinghy fast.

60|$|I {{found myself}} out of the tavern and alone in the cool May night. And as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> the deserted street, my head in a whirl, a hand was laid on my shoulder. I turned, startled, to face Mr. Wharton, the planter.|$|R
60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} after I regained the house. I went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes. Then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> straight <b>down</b> to the drawing-room, and I told myself that I was prepared for anything that might take place.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{a summer}} morning that I rose before the sun to compose myself for the {{crowning}} of my work with this end; and my dwelling being near to the sea, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the rocks on the shore, in order that I might behold the sun in his majesty.|$|E
60|$|Then I saw lighted windows down at {{the other}} end of the front part of the house. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down.</b> A door stood open and through it I saw a room {{identical}} with that at the other corner; and here were Colonel Sampson, Wright, and several other men, all smoking and talking.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was quite}} {{late on a}} Monday {{afternoon}} that Bill stopped at our house again. He did not call out this time.

40|$|The gracious donor, the dean, and {{the other}} honors program {{director}} and <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the corridor of an old campus building needing repair but possessing {{a great deal of}} charm. While a science classroom building is being renovated, this hall houses temporary offices for displaced faculty. We look at the high ceilings in a room now used as a faculty break room and admire the way the morning sunlight plays on the walls. This room would make an amazing honors student lounge. Renovating the entire building would create a terrific honors dorm that could attract talented prospective students and encourage current honors students to remain at the college...|$|R
