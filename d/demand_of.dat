5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing.

The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> 396.5 MW.

40|$|The {{challenges}} of population ageing and globalisation {{have been addressed}} by many welfare states in terms of active ageing policies, which in turn confront individuals with new demands such as keeping up to date with technological developments. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse how individuals negotiate the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing. The outcome variable was change in primary and secondary control strategies with regard to <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing over the course of one year. In a German sample of N = 602 men and women aged 55 – 75 years, we found a strong preference for engagement with these demands and a low preference for disengagement. Furthermore, a higher load <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing was associated with an increase in engagement with these demands. However, when people perceived their everyday surroundings as unfavourable, their disengagement with <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing increased. Higher internal control beliefs concerning <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing were associated with an increase in engagement and a decrease in disengagement. We conclude that individuals strengthen their efforts to master <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> active ageing when they believe that they can control them. When the everyday ecology seems unfavourable, though, strategies are preferred that enable people to avoid a presumably lost case...|$|R
