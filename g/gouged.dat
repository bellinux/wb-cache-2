According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea is {{the only}} Hawaiian volcano with {{distinct}} evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering {{the formation of an}} ice cap. There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Pōhakuloa (180–130ka), Wāihu (80–60ka) and Mākanaka (40–13ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks. Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the Mākanaka glaciation, most of which were heavily <b>gouged</b> by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo TCDP {{boreholes}} A and B were {{drilled in}} the northern part of the Chelungpu thrust fault where the Chi-Chi earthquake (21 September 1999, Mw 7. 6) showed large displacement, low ground acceleration, and high slip velocity. In this paper, we describe the microstructures of the Chi-Chi Principal Slip Zone (PSZ) within black <b>gouges</b> localized at 1111 m depth in Hole A and at 1136 m depth in Hole B. In the FZA 1111 the PSZ is a 2 cm-thick isotropic clay-rich <b>gouge</b> which contains aggregates formed by central clasts coated by clay cortex (clay-clast aggregates (CCAs)) and fragments of older <b>gouges</b> segregated in the top third of the PSZ. In FZB 1136 the PSZ is 3 mm thick and is characterized by a foliated <b>gouge</b> displaying an alternation of clay-rich and clast-rich layers. The presence of CCAs, plucked underlying <b>gouge</b> fragments, <b>gouge</b> injections, and the occurrence of reverse grain size segregation of large clasts in the FZA 1111 isotropic <b>gouge</b> suggest that the <b>gouge</b> was fluidized as a result of frictional heating and thermal pressurization. The foliated <b>gouge</b> in FZB 1136 may be one locus of strain localization and related heat production. Small calcite veins present above the isotropic FZA 1111 PSZ <b>gouge</b> and, characterized by an increasing strain with increasing distance away from the PSZ, are attributed to coseismic fluid escape from the pressurized <b>gouge.</b> The observed microstructures are interpreted in view of their seismic implications for the Chi-Chi earthquake in terms of slip weakening mechanisms by thermal pressurization, <b>gouge</b> fluidization, coseismic fluid distribution, and postseismic slip. Above the PSZ, several layers of compacted <b>gouges</b> containing deformed CCAs and <b>gouge</b> fragments correspond to several PSZ of past earthquakes similar to the Chi-Chi earthquake and display a fault-parallel cleavage resulting from a low strain rate pressure solution deformation mechanism that may be correlated to the interseismic periods...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 7 tests of PIRAM (Pipeline Ice Risk Assessment and Mitigation) tests {{were carried out}} to {{simulate}} the progress of a <b>gouging</b> ice keel by centrifuge modeling. This thesis focuses on the subgouge deformations of the ice <b>gouging</b> process. The relationships between <b>gouge</b> depth, frontal berm, force, pressure, subgouge deformation and vertical extent of subgouge deformation {{are discussed in the}} thesis. The PIRAM tests were compared with the results of a similar series of previously conducted tests, and previous tests. Significance of the frontal berm height, <b>gouge</b> depth, <b>gouge</b> rate are also discussed. [...] The experimental program consisted of towing a model ice keel across a model testbed at a set <b>gouge</b> depth under various centrifuge acceleration. The test setup consisted of an aluminum half width ice keel model mounted on a gantry situated on top of the containment box given the centerline of the model was replaced by a viewing window to visualize the subgouge deformation accumulation. The model tests were conducted using saturated fine sand simulating seabed. Two tests were conducted with shallow <b>gouge</b> depths for comparison with previous Delft Hydraulics flume medium scale <b>gouge</b> tests to evaluate the applicability of centrifuge modeling. Three tests were conducted at a fast <b>gouge</b> rate since most of the previous work were conducted at a relatively slow rate. A large amount of data regarding ice keel <b>gouge</b> in sand was acquired from the experimental program the analysis of which described here in. [...] The combined depth of <b>gouge</b> depth and frontal berm height has a significant effect on the force and subgouge deformation. The force per unit width increases as the <b>gouge</b> depth increases. The vertical to lateral <b>gouge</b> force ratio seems to be independent of the aspect ratio which is <b>gouge</b> width divide <b>gouge</b> depth or attack angle. The kappa value is the frontal berm height normalized by <b>gouge</b> depth is linear with the aspect ratio. The kappa value has a significant effect on <b>gouge</b> force and subgouge deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PlV) technique was successfully used to track the evolution of subgouge deformation in all 7 tests. The maximum horizontal subgouge displacement occurred {{at the base of the}} keel and decreased with depth. The associated maximum <b>gouge</b> forces are a function of the keel attack angle and the <b>gouge</b> geometry. In comparison with previous tests, the vertical extent of subgouge deformation (SGD) was a function of combined depth and the soil state, but independent of the attack angle. The SGD are influenced by the attack angle and the soil state. Faster <b>gouge</b> rates may result in larger <b>gouge</b> forces by a factor of 2 to 3 and smaller horizontal subgouge deformations but similar vertical extent...|$|R

40|$|Strain {{localization}} during coseismic slip in fault <b>gouges</b> is {{a critical}} mechanical process that has implications for understanding frictional heating, the earthquake energy budget {{and the evolution of}} fault rock microstructure. To assess the nature of strain localization during shearing of calcite fault <b>gouges,</b> high-velocity (vmax= 1 m/s) rotary-shear experiments at normal stresses of 3 – 20 MPa were conducted under room-dry and wet conditions on synthetic calcite <b>gouges</b> containing dolomite <b>gouge</b> strain markers. When sheared at 1 m/s, the room-dry <b>gouges</b> showed a prolonged strengthening phase prior to dynamic weakening, whereas the wet <b>gouges</b> weakened nearly instantaneously. Microstructural analysis revealed that a thin (< 600 μm) high-strain layer and through-going principal slip surface (PSS) developed after several centimeters of slip in both dry and wet <b>gouges,</b> and that strain localization at 1 m/s occurred progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk <b>gouge</b> layer did not change significantly with increasing displacement indicating that, once formed, the high-strain layer and PSS accommodated most of the displacement. Thus, a substantial strain gradient is present in the <b>gouge</b> layer. In water-dampened <b>gouges,</b> localization likely occurs during and after dynamic weakening. Our results suggest that natural fault zones in limestone are more prone to rapid dynamic weakening if water is present in the granular slipping zones...|$|R
