5000|$|Blau, Ferber and Winkler (2010) define {{labor market}} {{discrimination}} {{as the situation}} when [...] "two equally qualified individuals are treated differently {{solely on the basis}} of gender (race, age, disability, etc)".(Note that this definition is different from the one offered by feminist economists) Analysis of the pay gap in Russia shows that discrimination is one of the major factors that account for the magnitude of wage differentials between men and women. Hansberry (2004) argues that a high level of discrimination against mothers and women in general is reflected in job advertisements, where employers state openly their preferences for males or women without children. Gerry, Kim and Li (2004) bring suggestive evidence of discrimination in the wage setting system. They estimate in their sample that between 87% and 94% of women received lower wages than they could have received if there was a non-discriminatory pay structure; men on the other hand would be worse off (the percentage of men who would be worse off ranges between 83% and 97%). Newelly and Reilly (2000) also report on discrimination in their study. They perform the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of the wage gap and include in the list of factors, that determine the explained wage gap, <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> segregation. The share of the unexplained wage gap the two authors estimate is significant, but if taking into consideration that it is possible for both occupation and industry segregation by gender to be a result of discrimination then in this case there would be an underestimation bias in the coefficient for discrimination (i.e. the level of labor market discrimination in reality would be higher than the one estimated by their unexplained share of the pay gap).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the effect of <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> {{segregation}} on the wage differential between resident and migrant workers in China. It extends the work of Meng and Zhang (2001) by considering the possible employment segregation of resident and migrant workers by both industry and occupation. I contend that industry segregation {{is at least as}} important as occupational segregation for Chinese migrant workers, as most migrant workers in China have come from the countryside to fuel the booming labor-intensive manufacturing and construction industries in the cites. Due to the hukou policy (a household registration system) in China, migrant workers normally face more constraints in searching for jobs in other sectors. My empirical study confirms that the proportion of the resident-migrant worker wage differential that is explained by industrial segregation is much larger than that explained by occupational segregation. Taking both <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> segregation into account explains the substantial wage differential between resident and migrant workers, which indicates the influence of <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> barriers on the wage differential in China...|$|E

30|$|The employee-level COI survey allows {{to measure}} the {{incidence}} of technical change and on-the-job training accounting simultaneously for the <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> specificity of the respondent’s job. This {{is in line with}} our theoretical model in which the effect of a technological change on retirement intentions may vary between different types of jobs. An important issue here consists in the choice of the aggregation level. This implies a trade-off between having the finest decomposition and having a sufficient number of individuals in each industry-occupation cell. In what follows, we define industries using the NAF- 36 classification and consider four occupations: managers, technicians, clerical workers and blue-collar workers.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} {{human capital}} {{of an individual}} is threatened by unemployment due to deterioration over time off the job (Pissarides 1992) as well as instant devaluation via an increased pressure to accept {{a job in a}} different industrial sector or occupation to which it cannot be transferred (Gangl 2006). These effects are confirmed by e.g. Burda and Mertens (2001) who report high levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> mobility of displaced workers in Germany connected to earnings losses. Fallick (1996) finds similar results for the USA. Gregory and Jukes (2001) and Bender et al. (2002) conclude that especially longer durations of unemployment have negative effects on earnings.|$|E
3000|$|... 10 In {{measuring}} prior {{occupational and}} industrial experiences, {{we do not}} differentiate between single and serial entrepreneurs. Thus, while wage-workers will commonly change jobs and gain additional experiences, our entrepreneurs do not. This means that our measure of variety of <b>industrial</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupational</b> experiences will be biased downward for entrepreneurs but not wage-workers. In our sample, almost one-quarter of our entrepreneurs started more than one business. The implication is that our empirical tests will be biased against finding greater variety of occupational and industrial experiences for our entrepreneurs. As will become apparent, despite this greater hurdle against finding results consistent with the Lazear “Jack-of-all-Trades” hypothesis, our empirical work generally supports the theory.|$|E
