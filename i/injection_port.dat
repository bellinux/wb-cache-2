40|$|Recent {{parallel}} systems use multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> {{and various}} <b>injection</b> policies, but {{little is known}} about their impact on network performance. This paper evaluates the influence that these injection interfaces have on maximum sustained throughput in adaptive cut-through torus networks by modeling the number of injection queues (1 or 4), and the allocation of new packets to those queues. Network evaluations for medium to large size 2 D tori show that designs with multiple <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> do not improve performance under uniform traffic. On the contrary, they result in more pressure from the injection interface to acquire the scarce network resources of an already clogged system. Interestingly, for small networks, a single injection FIFO queue, with the HOLB it entails, indirectly provides the much needed injection control. For networks with thousands of nodes and multiple injection channels, as those being implemented in current massively parallel processors, this implicit form of congestion control is not enough. In such systems, restrictive injection policies are required to prevent routers from being flooded with new packets for loads beyond saturation. 1...|$|R

The study includes discrete and distributed injection schemes applied: i) only at the rotor tip mid chord, and ii) both at the leading edge and at the mid chord of the rotor tip (combined injection). The effect of injection applied have been studied (i) during recovery only, and (ii) during the entire period from unstalled flow to the end of recovery (hysteresis). It is observed that various tip injection schemes are successful, in varying degrees, in alleviating hysteresis.

40|$|Class of 2011 AbstactOBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} if aseptic methods prescribed by the USP 797 {{are effective in}} preventing microbial growth when compounding intravenous medication. Sample size: 60 individual IV preparations, 20 {{for the control group}} and 20 per test group. METHODS: Sixty agar plates were made. The IV preparations for the control group were compounded with aseptic technique: washing hands with soap and water, wearing gloves, cleaning all ports with alcohol, and working in a laminar flow hood. A syringe was used to inject the water from the vial into the IV bag. This procedure was repeated in the same manner for Group A (no use of laminar flow hood) and Group B (no swiping of the <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> with an alcohol swab), minus the aseptic technique in question. Once all 60 IV preparations were completed, a sterile inoculation tool was used to obtain a sample from the port of the IV bag. The plates were then inoculated. RESULTS: When compared to the control group, microbial growth in Group A was not significant (p= 0. 14). The contamination rate for Group B was also not significant (p= 0. 07). CONCLUSION: Solutions compounded using abbreviated techniques (not swabbing <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> and not using laminar flow hood) are not more likely to be contaminated than when using all proper aseptic techniques simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} hydrogen was used in a diesel engine in the dual fuel mode using diesel as an ignition source. In {{order to have a}} precise control of hydrogen flow and to avoid the backfire and pre-ignition problems hydrogen was injected into the intake system. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimized injection timing, injection duration and injection quantity of the fuel in manifold and port injected hydrogen-operated engine using diesel as ignition source for hydrogen operation. From the results it was observed that in manifold injection technique the optimized condition was start of injection at gas exchange top dead centre (GTDC) with injection duration of 30 o crank angle (CA) with hydrogen flow rate of 7. 5 litres/min. In <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> technique, the optimized condition was start of injection at 5 o before gas exchange top dead centre (5 o BGTDC) with injection duration of 30 o CA with hydrogen flow rate of 7. 5 litres/min. With the above optimized timings of <b>port</b> and manifold <b>injection</b> it was observed that brake thermal efficiency in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> increases by 13 % and 16 % in manifold injection at 75 % load. However at full load the brake thermal efficiency decreases by 1 % in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and 8 % in manifold injection. A reduction in NOX emission by 4 times is observed in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and 7 times in manifold injection at full load. At 75 % load the NOX emission reduces by 3 times in both <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and manifold injection. Smoke emission increases with increase in EGR percentage. The smoke increases by 36 % at full load in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and by 44 % in manifold injection. At 75 % load the smoke emission reduces by 13 % in <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and 9 % in manifold injection. In both the <b>port</b> <b>injection</b> and manifold injection ignition delay was 12 o or 1. 33 ms while for diesel it was 11 o or 1. 22 ms. <b>Port</b> <b>injection</b> system with diesel as ignition source operates smoothly and shows improved performance and emit lesser pollution than diesel...|$|R

50|$|The SR50 DITECH {{uses the}} Synerject {{gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) system developed jointly by the Orbital Corporation and Siemens AG. The system uses a cam-driven air compressor to deliver air to the cylinder head at a pressure of , thereby avoiding the use of carburation; the cylinder walls are not wet with gasoline, only with lubricating oil. After the port is closed and the air is compressed by the piston, gasoline is injected by an atomizer like a spray nozzle mixed with and propelled by the highly compressed air, into the main combustion chamber where, after the <b>injection</b> <b>port</b> closes, and the piston is still rising, it is ignited in the compressed main charge of air.

50|$|In 2008 November, Mazda {{engineers}} {{improved the}} RX-8 body rigidity through {{the addition of}} structural reinforcements, by adding a trapezoidal shock tower brace and enhancing the local rigidity of the front suspension tower areas.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that a scroll compressor with multiple vapor <b>injection</b> <b>ports</b> {{has the potential to}} significantly improve the energy efficiency and maintain high heating capacity of vapor compression heat pumps, particularly at low outdoor temperatures, and that two-phase refrigerant injection performs slightly better than vapor injection with the same number of <b>injection</b> <b>ports.</b> However, considering the economic feasibility and the difficulty to control two-phase flow, only research on vapor injection has been performed as part of this study. To investigate the benefits of injection, a model of the vapor injected scroll compressor is presented. This model includes such sub-models as the geometry model, mass flow model, mechanical losses model and heat transfer model. Injection is treated as a part of leakage into the compression chamber. Based on a tradeoff between cost and benefit, a dual-port compressor prototype was chosen for testing to provide the experimental results, which are used to validate the model predictions. A hot gas bypass load stand has been modified to accommodate the testing of the prototype compressor with two intermediate refrigerant <b>injection</b> <b>ports.</b> Refrigerant is injected as saturated vapor at two pressures within the compression process. The model predictions are compared to experimental results at the same conditions as those used during the testing. Good agreement between measured results and model predictions indicates that the vapor injected scroll compressor model is validated. In addition, the overall performance of the heat pump system employing the compressor prototype is analyzed. Coupling the compressor testing results into a three-stage expansion vapor injection flash tank cycle model, the operating injection pressure can be determined under a certain working condition. The results showed that both lower and higher injection pressures and the corresponding injected mass flow rates decreased with an increase of pressure ratio of discharge pressure to suction pressure. Comparing the COP of the vapor injection cycle with the one of a baseline cycle, the improvement in COP increased with an increase of the pressure ratio and goes up to 19 % at a pressure ratio of 8 and a condensing temperature of 43. 3 °C. In addition, the proposed technology leads to higher energy efficiency and less degradation in heating capacity at low ambient temperatures. For Minneapolis, the seasonal efficiency (heating) of the vapor injection cycle was 13 % higher than that of the standard vapor compression cycle. ...|$|R
