60|$|His smart gig dashed alongside, {{and in two}} bounds he was up our accommodation-ladder {{and shaking}} me by the hand with his nervous grip, his eyes {{snapping}} inquisitively, for he supposed I had called at the Seven Isles group on my way. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> my pocket for a nicely folded little note, which he grabbed {{out of my hand}} without ceremony and carried off on the bridge to read by himself. After a decent interval I followed him up there, and found him pacing to and fro; for the nature of his emotions made him restless even in his most thoughtful moments.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} that I dealt with was, I think, a secretary. He was--I {{could see it}} at once--that perfect thing called an English gentleman. I have seldom seen, outside of {{baseball}} circles, so considerate a manner. He took my card, and from sheer considerateness left me alone for half an hour. Then he came {{back for a moment}} and said it was a glorious day. I had heard this phrase so often in Paris that <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> my pocket for ten cents. But something in the quiet dignity of the young man held me back. So I merely answered that it was indeed a glorious day, and that the crops would soon head out nicely if we got this sunshine, provided there wasn't dew enough to start the rust, in which case I was afraid that if an early frost set in we might be badly fooled. He said [...] "indeed," [...] and asked me if I had read the last London Weekly Times. I said that I had not seen the last one; but that I had read one about a year ago and that it seemed one of the most sparkling things I had ever read; I had simply roared over it from cover to cover.|$|E

And {{when it was time to}} sit down and write songs, when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> the attic to see what I was gonna write about, that's what was there. I just felt a strong passion toward the discovery of going there, and it opened my eyes, and all my senses were overwhelmed by the feeling of that place. When I sat down to write songs, that's all I could think of at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{letter-box}} I came to <b>I</b> stopped and <b>reaching</b> <b>into</b> my breast-pocket <b>I</b> {{took out the}} letter--it was as if I were plucking out my very heart--and dropped it through the slit. Then I went straight on board.|$|R
60|$|Presently I saw {{a series}} of doors opening from {{either side of the}} corridor, and as they all looked alike to me I tried the first one that <b>I</b> <b>reached.</b> It opened <b>into</b> a small chamber, luxuriously furnished, and was evidently an ante-chamber off some office or {{audience}} chamber of the palace.|$|R
60|$|Slowly I regained my {{composure}} {{and finally}} essayed again {{to attempt to}} remove the keys from the dead body of my former jailer. But as <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>into</b> the darkness to locate it I found to my horror that it was gone. Then the truth flashed on me; the owners of those gleaming eyes had dragged my prize away from me to be devoured in their neighboring lair; {{as they had been}} waiting for days, for weeks, for months, through all this awful eternity of my imprisonment to drag my dead carcass to their feast.|$|R

40|$|During the 20 th century, John Dewey {{introduced}} a new idea {{with respect to the}} nature of logical theory: He presented a portrait of logic as a theory about how organisms interact and maintain an integrated balance between themselves and their environment. He wrote many texts on what he called his theory of inquiry, including Essays in Experimental Logic (1916), Studies in Logical Theory (1903), and How We Think (1910). However, the book where he most closely detailed his theory of inquiry is in his Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (1938). These texts by Dewey have served as the source for much recent discussion and commentary in Dewey scholarship. Most of these interpretations on Dewey??s theory of inquiry, I maintain, misunderstand Dewey in some fundamental way. I argue that these commentators have gone wrong in interpreting Dewey and his works by failing to understand some aspect of his theory of inquiry. I illustrate the flaws in their interpretations and subsequently integrate the conclusions <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> a single, cohesive perspective on Dewey??s account of inquiry. The final chapter presents a new interpretation of Dewey that emphasizes the role of phenomenal, contextual, and social factors in the foundations of his logical works...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The {{poems in}} 'Deeper than Blood' present {{a mosaic of}} {{geographic}} location, intensely personal events, friends, family, and observations tied together by a feminine persona who {{is not afraid to}} explore her life and the lives of those around her. Section <b>I</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> the depths of the persona's sexuality and fears of dying, revealing a shadowed and troubled side of the persona. Section II mixes views of the persona from an outside and an inside perspective, looking at how others view her as she stands naked before them and how she observes herself through her past and her memories of people and places. Section III searches through childhood memories, family, and friends for an answer to what comes next in life and after life is over. Throughout the intricate life story presented by these poems, a peaceful mood prevails. By setting the mood as one of calm, the speaker presents the rollercoaster ride of life. Instead of seeming like she is on a wild ride, the persona flows like a boat over the swells of an ocean on a calm day, allowing the reader to take in all the eccentricities of life with the calm that pervades the poetry...|$|R
5000|$|While all {{previous}} Judge Dredd crossovers {{have been in}} continuity with 2000 AD's Dredd strip, Al Ewing has stated that Mars Attacks Judge Dredd takes place in IDW's Dredd continuity: [...] "I {{tend to think of}} it as 'Ultimate Dredd,' which means that <b>I</b> can <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> the toybox and pull out elements that have been used in [...] "2000 AD" [...] and use them a little differently." [...] This meant he could write a younger, [...] "meaner" [...] Dredd than he did in 2000 AD. At this point in time, the Manta Tank is still a classified prototype, East-Meg One is still intact, and Dredd and Anderson have worked together.|$|R
500|$|Swift solely penned [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] in {{the summer}} of 2008 and stored it away for a while. After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine's Day, Swift offered the song to the film {{producers}} for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album. [...] "When this movie opportunity came about, <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> back <b>into</b> my pocket and thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told The Tennessean. [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] was released as a single from the Valentine's Day soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the iTunes Store.

5000|$|At {{the same}} time, however, his {{incredibly}} drastic, dog-eat-dog, and inconsiderate qualities tend to show through {{in combination with}} his sensitive and redeeming qualities. For example, Hayley once told Stan, [...] "Dad, I've never seen this side of you. It's so sweet." [...] Stan playfully replied, [...] "Well, if you tell anybody I'll kill you." [...] The two laughed together {{for a moment before}} Stan suddenly took a serious, browbeating manner and added, [...] "I'm serious, I will kill you. <b>I</b> will <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> your chest, pull out your beating heart and eat it. All of it, every last bit!" [...] He concluded by affectionately stating, [...] "Well, sweet dreams, angel." [...] As another example, in the episode [...] "Oedipal Panties", Stan went to extremes to keep his mother, Betty, from finding a romantic partner for fear he would lose her. In the episode, Stan was revealed to have captured and detained all of Betty's former lovers to an uncharted island.|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} {{to the beach and}} clambered about over the rocky backbone, again hunting for me with lighted matches. The closeness of the shave impelled me to further flight. Not daring to wade upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on until <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the water. <b>Into</b> this I waded to a depth of three feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line parallel with the beach.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{a moment}} I was {{clutched}} by several hands, {{and there was}} no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burned through when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the opening <b>into</b> the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.|$|R
