25|$|However, when a {{significant}} {{destruction of the}} vegetation takes place (of natural origin such as an avalanche or human origin), the disturbance undergone by the ecosystem <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>important.</b> In this latter case, erosion {{is responsible for the}} destruction of the upper horizons of the ground, and is at the origin of a phenomenon of reversion to pioneer conditions. The phenomenon is called retrogression and can be partial or total (in this case, nothing remains beside bare rock). For example, the clearing of an inclined ground, subjected to violent rains, can lead to the complete destruction of the soil. Man can deeply modify the evolution of the soils by direct and brutal action, such as clearing, abusive cuts, forest pasture, litters raking. The climax vegetation is gradually replaced and the soil modified (example: replacement of leafy tree forests by moors or pines plantations). Retrogression is often related to very old human practices.|$|E

[...] "Wikipedia needs people to edit..." [...] and [...] "pseudoscience" [...] must be well substantiated before it can be added to an article. Skeptics also have edits removed when not well cited.

2500|$|Law and Society is an American movement, {{which was}} {{established}} after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had {{a vested interest in}} the study of law. The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by Lawrence Friedman: [...] "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>important</b> to be left to lawyers". Its founders believed that the [...] "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods". The establishment of the Law and Society Association in 1964 and of the Law and Society Review in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.|$|E
