The impact on energy, especially energy consumption for heating and cooling of buildings, is very important.

In this study, daily data of minimum and maximum temperature of 51 stations for 1959 - 2004 were used to detect annual and seasonal variations of heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> in Xinjiang, China, by using the Mann-Kendall trend test and linear regression techniques.

Also, the low temperature bins frequency results decreased in the 1993 - 2002 decade while the high temperature ones increased, compared to the 1983 - 1992 decade. The effect of temperature data variations on the energy consumption and on CO 2 emissions of buildings was examined by calculating the energy demands for heating and cooling and the CO 2 emissions from diesel-oil and electricity use of a typical residential building-model. From the study it is concluded that the heating energy requirements during the decade 1993 - 2002 were decreased, as compared to the energy demands of the decade 1983 - 1992, while the cooling energy requirements were increased. The variations of CO 2 emissions from diesel oil and electricity use were analog to the energy requirements alterations.

The heat island reduction can reduce the energy consumption within urban areas. The investigation {{of the characteristics of}} a heat island in a study on small-scale areas can provide more information about how to manage the increasing energy consumption in buildings. This research explores the effect of urban development on increasing inner cities? temperature. Austin was chosen as the study area because it experienced an average of 4. 7 degrees C per year increase in the land temperature from 1993 to 2011. Also, the rapid development during the past 30 years let the researcher track the changes. Secondary data assisted the researcher to conduct this research. The research developed a methodology to estimate urban heat intensities from atmospheric weather data and utilizing regression analysis to quantify urban development relation with urban heat island effect. Degree-day is an indirect measure for calculating the urban heat by considering the differences of the environmental temperatures from the standard base temperature. The warming trends have been calculated from the yearly sums of heating <b>degree-days</b> (HDD), and <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) from 1939 ? 2010. The ultimate results show that the heat island phenomenon is significantly related with land iii development only during the month of August. Also, CDD are significantly correlated to non-residential developments rather than the residential or total development. Therefore, recognizing heat mitigation strategies should be focused on non-residential sectors {{in order to reduce the}} CDD in summer.

The results indicate that winter and summer are the two peak seasons of energy consumption due to the urban residential heating and cooling demand. The base temperature of electricity and daily temperature is 10 °C in winter and 22 °C in summer respectively. When the outdoor temperature is below 10 °C, the heating demand becomes obvious, and with over 22 °C the cooling demand. The spatial distribution of <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) and heating degree-days (HDD) clearly shows urbanization effects.

In most US climate zones, cool roofs can reduce energy consumption because they reflect more sunlight and heat than standard roofs. Since temperatures are expected to increase in many regions, cool roofs may offer greater energy and cost savings than currently estimated. Energy consumption by Department of Energy (DOE) Research Laboratory buildings across the US with cool and standard roofs were assessed using metered energy datasets collected from 2003 - 2013. Statistical tests were conducted to compare differences in energy consumption of buildings between cool and standard roofs at sites in different climatic regions. In order to better understand the effectiveness of cool roof technologies in a future that is expected to become increasingly warmer, data collected from weather stations near each DOE site were used to interpret the potential influences of weather patterns on cool roof energy savings. This research confirmed that cool roofs do reduce energy consumption, especially at sites with warmer summers and milder winters.

30|$|The {{technique}} {{we consider}} {{to capture the}} dependence of present-time Italy electricity demand on meteorological variables is that presented by Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2015). They model the demand of ordinary days {{by means of a}} linear regression model made up of i) a time-dependent term capturing long-term trends, ii) a term accounting for the differences among the different days of the week and iii) a set of terms depending on temperature-derived variables that can be obtained from high-resolution Tn, Tm, and Tx fields. The latter are national averages over Italian urbanised areas of <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD), heating degree-days (HDD) and solar radiation deficit with respect to a defined threshold (S), with solar radiation estimated using daily temperature range as a proxy. Applying this technique, Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2014) quantified the present-time dependence of the Italian electricity demand of an ordinary day on CDD, HDD and S in, respectively, 24.6 GWh degree-day− 1, 6.6 GWh degree-day− 1 and 2.9 GWh day− 1  MJ− 1  m 2. These values give evidence of a relevant contribution of meteorological conditions on the electricity demand, especially in the summer period: in this season, the fraction of the electricity demand driven by meteorological conditions can exceed 20  %. Temperature is indeed the most important meteorological variable influencing the electricity demand: it regulates the request for conditioning in summer and for heating in winter (Pardo et al. 2002; Moral-Carcedo & Vicéns-Otero 2005; Hor et al. 2005; Bessec & Fouquau 2008; Hekkenberg et al. 2009; Apadula et al. 2012).

The combined model is evaluated with measurements from an urban neighborhood in Basel, Switzerland, {{and the importance of}} surface–atmosphere model coupling is demonstrated. Impacts of extensive albedo increases in two Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods are modeled. Clear-sky summertime reductions of diurnal maximum air temperature for the residential neighborhood (λp = 0. 33) are − 1. 1 °, − 1. 5 °, and − 3. 6 °C for uniform roof albedo increases of 0. 19, 0. 26, and 0. 59, respectively; reductions are about 40 % larger for the downtown core (λp = 0. 53). Realistic impacts will be smaller because the 1 D modeling approach ignores advection; a lake-breeze scenario is modeled and temperature reductions decline by 80 %. Assuming no advection, the analysis is extended to seasonal and annual time scales in the residential neighborhood. Yearly average temperature decreases for a 0. 59 roof albedo increase are about − 1 °C, with summer (winter) reductions about 60 % larger (smaller). Annual <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-day</b> decreases are approximately offset by heating degree-day increases and the frequency of very hot days is reduced. Despite the variability of modeling approaches and scenarios in the literature, a consistent range of air temperature sensitivity to albedo is emerging; a 0. 10 average increase in neighborhood albedo (a 0. 40 roof albedo increase for λp = 0. 25) generates a diurnal maximum air temperature reduction of approximately 0. 5 °C for “ideal” conditions, that is, a typical clear-sky midlatitude summer day...|$|R

As a baseline for comparison, the technical, economic (using discounted cash flow) and environmental aspects of traditional electrification approaches, namely photovoltaic (PV) systems and diesel generators, are quantified, and options for meeting heating and cooling loads (e. g. gas-fired heaters, absorption chillers, or solar water heaters) are evaluated alongside an emerging micro-concentrating solar power (-CSP) technology featuring a solar thermal organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Photovoltaics hybridized with LPG/Propane and -CSP trigeneration are the lowest cost alternatives for satisfying important but often overlooked thermal requirements, with cost advantages for CSP depending on latitudinal variation in insolation and thermal parameters. For a 15 -year project lifetime, the net present cost for meeting clinic energy needs varied from 45 to 75 k USD, with specific levelized electricity costs of 0. 26 – 0. 31 USD/kWh. In comparison, diesel generation of electricity is both costly (> 1 USD/kWh) and polluting (94 tons CO 2 per site over 15 years), while LPG/Propane based heating and cooling emits 160 – 400 tons CO 2 depending on ambient conditions. The comparative analysis of available technologies indicates that where the energy demand includes a mixture of electrical and thermal loads, as in typical health and education outposts, on-carbon emitting -CSP trigeneration approaches can be cost-effective.

40|$|The {{heat stress}} index (HSI) is a new, {{comprehensive}} summer index that evaluates daily relative stress for locations throughout the United States based on {{deviations from the}} norm. The index is based on apparent temperature and other derived meteorological variables, including cloud cover, <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days,</b> and con-secutive days of extreme heat. Statistical distributions of meteorological variables are derived for 10 -day periods of the annual cycle so that percentile values for each parameter can be determined. The daily percentile values for each variable are then summed, and a statistical distribution is fit to the summed frequencies. The daily HSI value is the percentile associated with {{the location of the}} daily summed value under the summation curve. The index is analyzed and spatially verified by comparing intra- and interregional results. Although stations from various climate regions have different criteria defining an excessive heat stress event, neighboring stations typically produce similar HSI results because they are usually affected by the same air mass. To test the effectiveness of the HSI, a relationship between the index results and mortality values is made. Overall, the highest mortality days are associated with the highest HSI values, but high-HSI days are not always associated with high numbers of deaths. A mortality study such as this one {{is just one of many}} potential environmental applications of the HSI. Other applications include implementing the index to correlate extreme weather con-ditions with resource consumption, such as electric-utility load, to determine conditions for which load levels are excessive. The ability to forecast the HSI using a variety of weather forecasting tools has also generated interest within various industries that have a need to issue weather stress advisories, watches, and warnings. 1...|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} {{meteorological}} data from 1971 to 2010, made the <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> (CDD) {{as a factor}} of the cooling energy consumption assessment in the warm season, we analyzed changing characteristics and the attribution of CDD and cooling days in Chongqing region, and assessed {{the effects of the}} temperature change on the cooling energy consumption of Chongqing. The results showed that there were significant differences between CDD and cooling days in Chongqing region, CDD and cooling days in regions along the river or in the valleys were more compared to the southeast part and Chengkou county where have a high altitude. In the recent 40 years, the evolution of CDD and cooling days in all districts of Chongqing were basically the same as the average value in this region; they all had experienced the process of rise after the first drop, and a turn in the middle of 1980 s. The temperature and the cooling energy consumption had a significant synchronization, the effects of temperature on the cooling energy consumption increased with the higher temperature. The average cooling energy consumption in Chongqing regions in the warm season (May to September) / summer (June to August) will increase by 56 % / 46 % if the temperature rises 1. In the warm season or in summer, the cooling energy consumption value in all sections in Chongqing with 1 higher will be descending in the follow order: southeast, west, southwest,central part, the urban area, the northeast section. If the temperature in the warm season rises 1, the cooling days in the area would increase by 16 days, the urban area would increase by 14 days, and the other regions would increase by 15 days. Finally, we set a cooling energy consumption assessment model by using the changing rate between the average temperature and the cooling energy consumption, so people can give assessment and quantitative estimates to the cooling energy consumption changes in Chongqing regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{file with}} the "a" is the PowerPoint {{presentation}} given at the Hot and Humid Conference. The Texas Mental Health and Mental Retardation agency, {{now part of the}} Texas Health and Human Services Commission, was challenged to deal with regularly deteriorating infrastructure at twentythree large campuses located throughout the state during large statewide budget cuts in 2003. Repair and replacement funding was considerably reduced with costs amounting to more than $ 250 million. The agency therefore decided to take advantage of new state legislation passed in the prior biennium allowing state agencies to use utility savings performance contracting as a means to replace aging and inefficient equipment. In such contracts, the utility savings will pay for the more efficient equipment cost over a fifteen-year period. The utility savings are measured {{over the life of the}} contract in order to ensure the savings stream and maintain the savings guarantee. The agency chose an energy services firm specializing in performance contracting. This company uses a utility bill analysis software tool based on <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days</b> and heating degree-days. To date, savings have accrued for over two years for the first phase of the project and are presented in this paper for one of the measured electric meters. This paper focuses on the on-going savings stream to demonstrate the importance of continued measurement and verification on a representative meter at the Austin State Hospital located in Austin, Texas. In this paper, the Energy Services Company (ESCO) savings results are compared to savings results calculated from a regression analysis software package using average outdoor air temperature data and actual preand post-retrofit data. The software used as the comparison calculates simple mean, two-parameter (2 P), three-parameter (3 P) change point, or fourparameter (4 P) change point models to be used as the utility baseline. To accurately account for the guaranteed savings, it is necessary to apply detailed as well as practical measurement and verification techniques. The agency continues to work closely with the ESCO to generate a savings persistence program that both parties can effectively put into practice; thus ensuring long-term goals are met.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon a series of {{statistical}} programs written in SAS. The programs {{can be used to}} evaluate the economic impacts of future and historical climate/weather regimes for the contiguous United States. Individuals (or corporations) interested in the specifics of these programs should contact the author directly. This study quantifies the impact of weather on eleven two-digit SIC sectors of the U. S. economy ranging from agriculture and construction to retail trade and utilities. Although it is obvious that weather affects the output of most sectors in some way, the magnitudes of these effects are not well known. This research effort estimates the historical sensitivity of production to annual weather variability. In addition to defining what it means for a sector to be sensitive to weather relative to another sector, industry productivity from 1977 - 2000 was modeled against measures of temperature and precipitation along with more traditional inputs to production like capital, labor and energy consumption. Specifically, sector output is modeled using a transcendental logarithmic production function (TRANSLOG) with measures of regional weather included. In order to estimate the aggregate sensitivity of the U. S. economy to weather, Monte-Carlo simulation of the four measures of weather is employed for each region by randomly drawing from historically observed weather combinations (i. e. temperature and precipitation) to produce distributions of sector-region output variability holding the conventional economic inputs constant. As expected, the results show that the impact of weather varies from region to region and sector to sector. It is also evident that traditional methods used to model economic production such as the Cobb-Douglas and TRANSLOG specifications are improved statistically with the inclusion of measures of weather as factors of production. Given the available data at the annual level, the econometric results show that in general and across regions, the manufacturing sector is more sensitive to weather (e. g. <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days)</b> than previously thought. The results also indicate that economic sectors in the Western U. S. are more sensitive to weather than they are in the Midwest and East Coast. It is also reported that as the standard deviation of precipitation changes by 1 %, average U. S. transportation and utilities sector output drops between. 02 % and. 09 % (respectively). For context, actual year 2000 output for the utilities sector was over $ 200 billion and actual transportation output exceeded $ 300 billion at the national level. Similar data is reported for nine additional sectors and four measures of weather across eight regions of the country. Although small with respect to traditional factors of production, it is shown that U. S. GDP has expanded on average by $ 20. 8 billion ($ 2004 U. S.) annually with measured, historical weather variability. In contrast to the subjective estimates made by Dutton (2003) indicating that ?one-third of private industry activities are sensitive to weather?, this research finds that only 16. 2 % of the aggregate U. S. economy is sensitive to weather on an annual basis. Nevertheless, the effects of weather variability on specific sectors, particularly in Western states, is substantial.

40|$|The use of time-of-day (TOD) pricing as a load {{management}} tool for electric utilities has recently gained wide interest. Although utilities have successfully used TOD pricing for some industrial customers, its applicability {{in the residential}} sector is untested. The Federal Energy Administration (and now the Department of Energy) has funded several experiments to test the implications of TOD pricing for residential customers. The major objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the Arizona TOD pricing experiment. Data from the first six months of the experiment had been analyzed previously in several different studies. Summaries of their methodologies and results are presented in Chapter 1. Many of these earlier analyses were unable to identify significant TOD price responses. A major deficiency in all was their failure to account properly for participation incentive payments. Consequently, meaningful inferences regarding residential responses to TOD prices cannot be drawn from these misspecified models. Chapter 2 contains a description of the experiment and the data is generated. The basic observation is monthly kilowatt hours consumed by each household in three time periods. Special attention is given to the derivation of the incentive payment inherent in the experimental design. This payment depends on experimental rates and patterns of pre-experimental usage. Specific adjustments to the data are required due to variations in billing cycle lengths and days. Details of these procedures and information on how the samples were edited are discussed in Chapter 3. The conclusion of this chapter presents data which reveal that households did significantly shift consumption from high to low cost periods. Chapter 4 contains a description of the hypothesized models and statistical methodology. Since this study focuses on household responses to TOD prices while controlling for impacts of experimental design, theoretically derived models are not tested. Income, TOD prices, heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>degree-days,</b> the electricity-using capacity of the households' appliance stocks, and incentive payments are the major determinants of consumption investigated. Ordinary least squares techniques are used to estimate TOD demand models for each month, for the summers of 1976 and 1977, and for the winter of 1976 / 77. Since the experimental design was modified in May, 1977, an analysis of covariance was done to test for structural changes. The results presented in Chapter 5 emphasize the importance of including the incentive payment in the TOD models. Without this term, no TOD price is significant. With it, TOD prices and the other independent variables are shown to be significant determinants of consumption. Statistical results are very impressive for the models estimated from the 18 months of cross-sectional data. Since the incentive payments depended partially on the rates to which customers were assigned, calculation of price elasticities had to be modified accordingly. Simple elasticities measured price responses which ignored the impact of the incentive payment. Since the incentive did not depend on experimental usage, it is the appropriate measure of household responses to TOD prices. Total price elasticities are used to measure TOD price responses under the specific Arizona experimental environment. A number of important conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6. The most important deal with the treatment of the incentive payment. When it is properly modeled, meaningful price coefficients can be estimated. Also, the results strongly suggest that households earmarked this payment for electricity purchases. Partial derivatives of the incentive were much larger than those for income. Misleading billing information may have produced this unexpected result. In May, 1978, billing procedures were improved. An analysis of these data should shed more light on this important matter...|$|R
