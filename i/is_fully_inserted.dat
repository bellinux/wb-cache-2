Sheep and swine will reach brain death in under 10 seconds; however, larger animals, notably cattle may take up to 40 seconds to reach brain death. This period may extend to a couple of minutes if complications, such as arterial occlusion, occur. However, the animal's inverted position allows blood to flow more precipitously and thus makes an animal regaining consciousness before it is fully exsanguinated highly unlikely. In any case, animal welfare advisory councils clearly emphasize that the time from incapacitation to start of exsanguination should be prompt; recommending a time under 15 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|The P22 is {{equipped}} with a magazine disconnect that prevents the trigger from operating on the sear mechanism unless a magazine is actually inserted and locked into the weapon. [...] The magazine disconnect on a P22 works by using a strong spring to apply downward force against the trigger bar, such force being sufficient to overcome the action of the relatively weaker trigger spring which interacts with upward force on the same bar. When a magazine is not locked into the weapon, the downward force of the stronger magazine disconnect spring causes the trigger bar to pass beneath the internal lockwork of the weapon when the trigger is pressed. Once a magazine <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> <b>inserted,</b> however, an actuator surface {{on the front of the}} magazine pushes against the magazine safety. This overcomes the magazine safety's strong spring, and thereby serves to allow the trigger bar to spring upward under the force of the less powerful trigger spring.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{characteristics}} of external kink instabilities observed during wall stabilization {{studies in the}} HBT-EP tokamak have been compared with the predictions of ideal MHD theory, {{in order to examine}} the stabilizing role of a resistive wall that is segmented both toroidally and poloidally. The reconstructed equilibria, for discharges with dierent plasma{wall congurations, are consistent with external and internal magnetic measurements, measured soft X ray proles and measured equi-librium wall eddy currents. The stability analysis of these equilibria predicts patterns of instability induced eddy currents for a model wall that is continuous and perfectly conducting, and these patterns are in good agreement with the ones observed on the HBT-EP segmented wall. These eddy currents account for the observed stabilization of fast ideal modes when the wall <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> <b>inserted,</b> consistent with the prediction of marginal stability. 1...|$|E
40|$|This review {{looks at}} the {{implementation}} of magnetic-based approaches in surgical instruments for abdominal surgeries.

This addresses many constraints encountered by conventional laparoscopic tools, such as loss of triangulation, fulcrum effect, and loss/lack of dexterity for surgical tasks.

5000|$|The early [...] "screw" [...] {{mechanisms}} for sealing the breech consisted of threaded blocks which were screwed tightly into the breech after loading, but the threads themselves were insufficient {{to provide a}} gas-tight seal.

Hence if the block circumference was divided into two sets of threads and gaps, the block only needed to be rotated ¼ turn to lock it instead of several turns.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} an {{insertable}} stereoscopic 3 D imaging system for minimally invasive surgery. It {{has been designed}} and developed toward the goal of single port surgery. The device <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> <b>inserted</b> into the body cavity and affixed to the abdominal wall. It contains pan and tilt axes to move the camera under simple and intuitive joystick control. A polarization-based stereoscopic display is used to view the images in 3 D. The camera’s mechanical design is based upon a single camera prototype we have previously built. We have run calibration tests on the camera {{and used it to}} track surgical tools in 3 D in real-time. We have also used it in a number of live animal tests that included surgical procedures such as appendectomy, running the bowel, suturing, and nephrectomy. The experiments suggest that the device may be easier to use than a normal laparoscope since there is no special training needed for operators. The Pan/Tilt functions provide a large imaging volume that is not restricted by the fulcrum point of a standard laparoscope. Finally, the 3 -D imaging system significantly improves the visualization and depth perception of the surgeon. I...|$|E

A total of 58 wood stakes (29 loblolly pine, Pinus taeda, and 29 aspen, Populus tremuloides) that were vertically installed (full length) in forest soils were non-destructively tested {{by means of}} a laboratory-type acoustic measurement system. The same acoustic measurements were also conducted on the wood stakes after they were removed from the soil.

50|$|In {{order for}} the lock to operate, the key must <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> <b>inserted,</b> {{allowing}} the dual sidebars to enter the pins, provided the pins were raised to the correct height, thereby freeing the cylinder core for rotation. The cylinder does not use the traditional top- and bottom-pin combination, relying instead only on {{the holes in the}} side of the pins and pressure applied by the 12 springs above. Many pins have a dummy hole which will trap the sidebar pin if any turning pressure is applied to the lock with the pin in the incorrect position, preventing the lock from opening. Due to the lack of top pins, lock bumping is theoretically impossible; because bumping requires a moment in time when the two pins separate, and when this occurs and turning pressure is applied, the cylinder will rotate, thereby causing the lock to open. This bumping technique uses the principles of Newton's cradle.|$|R
