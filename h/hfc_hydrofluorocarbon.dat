40|$|Abstract. The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace <b>HFC</b> (<b>hydrofluorocarbon)</b> refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially scroll type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and refrigerant pressures. Two types of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|E
40|$|HFC 134 a (1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane) and HFC 227 (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 -heptafluoropropane) {{are used}} to replace {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs) in refrigerant and aerosol applications, including medical use in metered-dose inhalers. Production and consumption of CFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The safety and pharmacokinetics of HFC 134 a and HFC 227 were assessed in two separate double-blind studies. Each <b>HFC</b> (<b>hydrofluorocarbon)</b> was administered via whole-body exposure as a vapor to eight (four male and four female) healthy volunteers. Volunteers were exposed, once weekly for 1 h, first to air and then to ascending concentrations of HFC (1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 parts per million (ppm)), interspersed with a second air exposure and two CFC 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) exposures (1000 and 4000 ppm). Comparison of either HFC 134 a or HFC 227 to CFC 12 or air gave no clinically significant results {{for any of the}} measured laboratory parameters. There were no notable adverse events, {{there was no evidence of}} effects on the central nervous system, and there were no symptoms of upper respiratory tract irritation. HFC 134 a, HFC 227, and CFC 12 blood concentrations increased rapidly and in an exposure-concentration-dependent mariner, although not strictly proportionally, and approached steady state. Maximum blood concentrations (C(max)) tended to be higher in males than females; in the HFC 227 study, these were statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in males for each HFC 227 and CFC 12 exposure level. In the HFC 134 a study, the gender difference in C(max) was only statistically significant (P < 0. 05) for CFC 12 at 4000 ppm and HFC 134 a at 8000 ppm. Following the end of exposure, blood concentrations declined rapidly, predominantly biphasically and independent of exposure concentration. For the HFC 134 a study, the t(1 / 2) α (α elimination half-life) was short for both CFC 12 and HFC 134 a (< 11 min). The t(1 / 2) β (β elimination half-life) across all exposure concentrations was a mean of 36 and 42 min for CFC 12 and HFC 134 a, respectively. Mean residence time (MRT) was an overall mean of 42 and 44 min for CFC 12 and HFC 134 a, respectively. In the HFC 227 study, t(1 / 2) α for both CFC 12 and HFC 227, at each exposure level, was short (< 9 min) and tended to be lower in males than females. For CFC 12 mean t(1 / 2) β ranged from 23 to 43 min and for HFC 227 the mean range was 19 - 92 min. The values tended to be lower for females than males for HFC 227. For bath CFC 12 and HFC 227, MRT was statistically significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in males than females and independent of exposure concentration. For CFC 12, MRT was a mean of 37 and 45 min for males and females, respectively, and for HFC 227 MRT was a mean of 36 and 42 min, respectively. Exposure of healthy volunteers to exposure levels up to 8000 ppm HFC 134 a, 8000 ppm HFC 227, and 4000 ppm CFC 12 did not result in any adverse effects on pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, or lung function.
