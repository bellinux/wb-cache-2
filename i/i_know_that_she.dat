It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, 1983, {{eight months}} after Karen's death, the Carpenter family celebrated the {{unveiling}} of the Carpenters' new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Richard said in his speech, [...] "This is a sad day, {{but at the same}} time a very special and beautiful day to my family and me. My only regret is that Karen is not physically here to share it with us, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is very much alive in our minds, and in our hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{commanding}} officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, {{who gave}} her leave for training, said “I wish to congratulate Heather and Helen on their success; it was an excellent achievement. Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK. I am {{sure that they have}} been inspired by her performance {{and we look forward to}} welcoming her back to the Regiment later this year. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is keen to deploy with her soldiers to Helmand in 2013.” ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had passed}} through a fiery sea of suffering, and I kept back the anger which {{threatened}} me. I pointed upwards.|$|R
2500|$|After {{pleading}} {{not guilty}} to state charges of first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree armed robbery, felonious larceny, and felonious possession of stolen goods, Lovette remained in custody awaiting his trial, which began on December 6, 2011. Lovette declined to testify during the trial. On December 20, 2011, a jury found Lovette guilty on all charges. After the verdict, Judge Allen Baddour, the same judge who sentenced Atwater in 2010, stated, [...] "The life that Ms. Carson led was too short, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{continues to be an}} inspiration, not only for her family, but for thousands in this community and across this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 26, 2006, Harris's {{campaign}} {{released a}} [...] "Statement of Clarification", that stated, “In the interview, Harris {{was speaking to}} a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in Judeo-Christian values." [...] The press release went on to mention her past support of Israel and quoted her Jewish campaign manager Bryan G. Rudnick, who stated “As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> encourages people of all faiths to engage in government so that our country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by our founding fathers, without malice towards anyone.” At an appearance at an Orlando gun show that same day, she said [...] "it breaks my heart" [...] to think people understood her comments as bigoted. When asked if she thought the Founding Fathers intended the nation to have secular laws she replied, ...|$|E
60|$|The {{scene was}} beyond his describing. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> kissed him good-bye.|$|E
60|$|As I {{heard her}} {{close the door}} of her mother's room, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would first pray before the shrine of the little Virgin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I religiously believe it," [...] {{rejoined the}} sculptor; [...] "and yet my mind {{would be the}} easier, if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{returned}} safely to her tower." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your {{smile is}} crooked?” I asked him; for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> must attend him, and I wished {{to save her}} as much as possible.|$|R
60|$|THIRD PAGE. Fie on her dropsy, so {{she have}} a dropsy! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever sweet to me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> lives!' and Diane {{once more}} sank {{at his feet}} a trembling, shrinking, annihilated heap of shame and misery.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the match}} be broken off, I {{will take care}} that you shall hear it. I will write to Janet Fenwick. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is your friend." ...|$|E
60|$|She said they, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did {{not expect}} poor old Hasketh really to count in the matter, any more than she {{expected}} me to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{neither did}} I think that: my niece, I felt sure, was safe from danger. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would do nothing}} that would bring either her or me to shame." ...|$|R
60|$|After this I said no more, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{meant to}} warn me. We had entered on this {{business}} and must {{see it through}} to its end, sweet or bitter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know she}} didn't. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> HAD {{to do it}} {{just the same as}} if Miss Gage had driven her at the point of the bayonet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will not}} forget my mother? I forgive her, if I have any cause. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> forgives me, and is sorry in her heart. You will not forget her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{even in that}} case, I don't see why {{you should}} mind it. It was {{certainly}} very friendly of her, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has your interest at heart entirely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I liked it, Mr. Paret," [...] {{she replied}} simply, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had understated. It was quite {{apparent}} that Krebs had captivated her. I {{tried not to}} betray my annoyance.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} my mental remarks ceased, for I observed, to my surprise, that Eve opened a small book, {{and from the}} {{continuous}} tone of her voice, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> {{not being}} told some {{story of my}} {{abandonment}} of her? How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> she isn't being led to believe I no longer want {{her to come to}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never asked. I hate gossiping, and I make a rule {{to inquire}} into no secrets but such as are voluntarily confided to me; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has never told Sabina." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think that}} it will be for any good," [...] said Mrs. Trevelyan; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be trusted. And I suppose it ought to be so, if you wish it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knights, she is your cousin, that I know, {{as surely}} as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is my niece. Tell me now, is she aught more to you?" [...] and he searched them with those {{piercing}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|I, too, crept {{nearer to}} it.--About a yard away {{there was a}} {{projection}} of the front. I stole into the deep corner and waited. A few feet from me <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> too was waiting.|$|R
60|$|I waited anxiously {{for some}} reply. The worst was now out, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had heard of}} it before; but it was {{impossible}} for me to go on with my narrative without some shadow of encouragement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{indifferent}} as to {{the money}} matters of other people, sir. I {{had no intention of}} marrying Miss Waddington for her money before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was your granddaughter; nor have I now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Trefoil {{is quite}} welcome," [...] said Sir John. [...] "It isn't a bad idea. Perhaps she may carry a lady, {{because she has}} never been tried. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> objects {{strongly}} to carry a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{know more}} than you suppose. Come, Miss Lind, let us {{understand}} one another. Your family want your cousin to marry Lady Constance. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>She</b> does not object. I know that too. He does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had not {{formulated}} {{it in my}} mind," [...] said Miriam. [...] "Will {{you take}} her with you to-day? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has {{made up her mind}} she cannot wait any longer for the doctor to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} unhappy about her," [...] Olive resumed. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> anxious and troubled all the time. Can't you do something, Ben? Have {{a talk with}} that disgusting thing, {{and see if you}} can't put him {{straight}} again, somehow?" ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not disturb}} her. The minutes passed, the light waned until I {{could see her}} no longer, and yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my name.|$|R
6000|$|... "She had {{not done}} so when she last wrote. I {{mentioned}} it to her the other day, before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had left Paris. If my letters and her sister's letters have been sent on to her, she must know it now." ...|$|R
