5|$|A {{variety of}} social, cultural, <b>ethnic,</b> and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russification and <b>ethnic</b> Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain primacy, even amongst <b>ethnic</b> Ukrainians. In Crimea, <b>ethnic</b> Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central Ukraine, which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian <b>ethnic,</b> national, and linguistic identity remained intact.|$|E

This revolt was quashed by Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, who sent 1,800 troops, together with schutterij (militia) and eleven battalions of conscripts, to the two areas; they imposed a curfew on all Chinese inside the city walls to prevent them from plotting against the Dutch. When a group of 10,000 <b>ethnic</b> Chinese from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi was stopped at the gates the following day, Valckenier called an emergency meeting of the council for 9 October.
