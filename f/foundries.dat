5|$|Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, {{which is used to}} cast articles in <b>foundries</b> such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.|$|E

5|$|The {{grave in}} Abney Park was {{eventually}} surmounted by a memorial stone for Reed's {{family in the}} style of a Celtic cross, reflecting their connections to Ireland. It was cut by the O'Shea brothers' firm. Reed's biographer, the printing executive and historian Stanley Morison, suggests that Reed's legacy is his History of the Old English Letter <b>Foundries,</b> while Jack Cox, historian of the B.O.P, asserts that the school stories first serialised in the magazine are the writer's true memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The <b>foundries</b> which produced battleship guns were dedicated {{instead to the}} production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War—France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia—suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Bridgwater {{was also}} home {{to a number of}} iron <b>foundries.</b> George Hennet's Bridgwater Iron Works worked on bridges, {{railways}} and machinery for Brunel and Robert Stephenson. This location allowed the import by boat of raw materials from Wales and the dispatch of finished work to south Devon using the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The carriage workshops for the latter were on an adjacent site. The works passed to his son and then traded as Hennet, Spink & Else. Some of the ironwork was produced for the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, Cornwall. In 1873 it became the Bridgwater Engineering Company Limited but this failed in 1878. W Wills Ltd produced steam locomotives and fingerposts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century heavy {{industry}} was replaced by service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel <b>foundries</b> and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also the home of the family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.|$|E
5|$|In the new magazine's {{first year}} Reed {{was a regular}} {{contributor}} of articles and stories {{on a range of}} subjects, joining distinguished writers such as G. A. Henty, R.M. Ballantyne and Jules Verne. A prominent illustrator for the magazine was the artist and mountaineer Edward Whymper. Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter <b>Foundries,</b> especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and <b>foundries,</b> as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{solution to the}} high volume of excess <b>foundry</b> sands generated in metal casting facilities is to beneficially reuse them. A variety of possible reuse programs suit the utilization of <b>foundry</b> sands. These programs mainly relate to civil and agricultural applications, e. g., highway embankment, concrete, backfills, topsoil, and growing amendments. <b>Foundry</b> sand exhibits qualified physical, mechanical, or chemical properties for these end-use products and is acknowledged as a marketable resource. Most often, <b>foundry</b> sand is characterized to match a target material, which has been adopted as a standardized component in an end-use product, e. g. fine aggregate in concrete. If the match gives favorable outcomes, the <b>foundry</b> sand is introduced fully or partially replacing the target material to form a technically competitive end-use product, e. g. <b>foundry</b> sand used in concrete. In addition to its engineering qualifications, <b>foundry</b> sand’s environmental safety is also ensured to comply with regulations. The chemical characterization of <b>foundry</b> sand needs to be accomplished to demonstrate {{that it will not}} pose a thread to environments and human health during reuse programs. This chapter is organized to present the system (<b>foundry)</b> sand operation, <b>foundry</b> sand generation and management, chemical characterization of <b>foundry</b> sand, reuse applications of <b>foundry</b> sand.

5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type <b>foundries.</b> Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|Other {{industries}} in the town included brick making and chimney pot manufacture. Raw materials were sourced from local collieries. In Mill Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s. John Cockerill moved to the town from Haslingden before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of Cockerill-Sambre. James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager. Several <b>foundries</b> and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholme's along Bridgewater Street. Munitions, aircraft and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War. Chemicals were manufactured by companies such as Bealey's and J. & W. Whewell.|$|E
5|$|Talbot Baines Reed (3 April 1852– 28 November 1893) was an English {{writer of}} boys' fiction who {{established}} a genre of school stories that endured into the mid-20th century. Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's. He {{was a regular}} and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter <b>Foundries.</b>|$|E

Their <b>foundry</b> also made goldsmith's items, stocking looms, clocks, and surveyor's compasses based on David Rittenhouse's designs. Hanks obtained a patent for [...] "Molding and Casting Bells" [...] in 1816. The Troy <b>foundry</b> manufactured large church bells under this patent. The Troy <b>foundry</b> also manufactured tower clocks and surveying tools. One of the apprentices, Andrew Meneely, went on to open a <b>foundry</b> of his own, which eventually became the Meneely Bell <b>Foundry.</b> After Hanks' death in 1824, the Troy <b>foundry</b> was operated for a year by his son Julius and eventually absorbed by the Meneely Bell <b>Foundry</b> (owner: Andrew Meneely) in 1826.|$|R
5|$|The British gave Benedict Arnold a brigadier general's commission, with {{an annual}} income of several hundred pounds, but paid him only £6,315 plus an annual pension of £360 because his plot had failed. In December 1780, Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia under orders from Clinton, where he {{captured}} Richmond by surprise {{and then went on}} a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, <b>foundries,</b> and mills. This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, {{settling}} in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated <b>foundries</b> throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church {{at the age of}} sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.|$|E
5|$|Various other German {{industrial}} enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories {{with their}} own subcamps. There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand. Subcamps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Mysłowice, Trzebinia, and other centers as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Satellite camps were designated as Aussenlager (external camp), Nebenlager (extension or subcamp), or Arbeitslager (labor camp). Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, <b>foundries</b> and other metal works, chemical plants, and other industries. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron <b>foundries</b> and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E
5|$|Blast furnace: Although {{cast iron}} tools and weapons {{have been found}} in China dating to the 5th century BC, the {{earliest}} discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced pig iron that could be remelted and refined as cast iron in the cupola furnace, date to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered date to the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) period immediately following 117 BC with the establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141– 87 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as <b>foundries</b> which made castings for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centres.|$|E
5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron <b>foundries</b> in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E
