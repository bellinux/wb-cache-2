Calculated load–deformation paths are compared to experimental results. It is found that the interlayer slippage in the nip area plays a key part in the deformation mechanism of the roll...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, dental resins find {{increasing}} use by practitioners. However, photopolymerization of such resins {{is limited}} to a so-called 'depth of cure'. To face this problem, dentists superimpose resin layers of limited depth. This technique raises the problem of the quality of <b>interlayer.</b> This <b>paper</b> aims at screening different cases of adhesion at the interface. Shear strength of such interfacial layers is tested in shear mode in various conditions (with or without an oxygen-inhibited layer, or contaminated by saliva or water). Unexpectedly, the presence of an oxygen-inhibition on the first layer, as assessed using micro-Raman spectroscopy, induces higher shear strength. In this case, a cohesive break occurs while an adhesive one is observed in all the other cases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive caesium (chiefly 137 Cs) {{is a major}} {{environmental}} pollutant. The mobility of Cs in temperate soils is primarily controlled by sorption onto clay minerals, particularly the frayed edges of illite <b>interlayers.</b> This <b>paper</b> investigates the adsorption of Cs to illite at the molecular scale, over both the short and long term. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that after initial absorption into the frayed edges, Cs migrated into the illite interlayer becoming incorporated within the mineral structure. Caesium initially exchanged with hydrated Ca at the frayed edges, causing them to collapse. This process was irreversible as Cs held in the collapsed interlayers was not exchangeable with Ca. Over the long term Cs did not remain {{at the edge of}} the illite crystals, but diffused into the interlayers by exchange with K. Results from extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and density functional theory modelling confirmed that Cs was incorporated into the illite interlayer and revealed its bonding environment...|$|R
40|$|Over a large {{range of}} the axial {{coordinate}} a typical higher-branch solution of the rotating-disk equations consists of a chain of inviscid cells separated from each other by viscous <b>interlayers.</b> In this <b>paper</b> the leading-order relation between two adjacent cells will be established by matched asymptotic expansions for general values of the parameter appearing in the equations. It is found that {{the relation between the}} solutions in the two cells crucially depends on the behaviour of the tangential velocity in the viscous interlayer. The results of the theory are compared with accurate numerical solutions and good agreement is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) is a layered {{manufacturing}} process involving an iterative combination of material addition and material removal. Polymer SDM processes have used castable thermoset resins {{to build a}} variety of parts. The strength of such parts {{is determined by the}} bulk material properties of the part materials and by their <b>interlayer</b> adhesion. This <b>paper</b> describes tensile testing of three thermoset resins used for SDM- two polyurethane resins and one epoxy resin. Both monolithic specimens and specimens with two interlayer interfaces were tested. Interlayer tensile strengths were found to vary greatly among the three materials, from 5 - 40 MPa...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of polymer due to weathering {{has been extensively}} studied in recent years (Martin et al. 2002, Liu et al. 2008, Md Akil et al. 2009, El-Din et al. 1995, Saad et al. 1995). Presently, laminated glass structures have been extensively used {{in the works of}} architecture and some of them have become old enough to show the first consequences of aging. Discoloration and delamination events are often observed in laminated glass structures. As laminated glass interlayer plays a mechanical rule, both at rupture and in the serviceability domain, it is important to evaluate the consequences of weathering on the mechanical properties of <b>interlayer.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> some results of an experimental campaign are reported, aimed at the definition of the weathering of laminated glass in the serviceability domain. For this reason, laminated glass specimens were subjected to laboratory degradation processes and the thermoviscoelastic behavior of interlayer was investigated before and after the degradation process...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the features {{to form a}} structure and properties of Fe-C-Cr-V system coverings provided by the plasma and powder coating (build-up) on the low carbon steel. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to restore a rod of hydraulic cylinders of small diameter by the plasma and powder coating. Thus, to avoid buckling and provide the built-up metal structure with the best wear resistance it is necessary to find a reasonable approach to a choice of the operation conditions to provide coating. The paper offers a way for efficient control of heat input at coating and a superheat value of the welding bath. It is noted that the coverings, which have been built up at the smallest heat input in a substrate, possess the best wear resistance, with a fusion zone formed with an austenitic crystallization <b>interlayer.</b> The <b>paper</b> defines consistent patterns to form a structure of coverings under various operation conditions of a plasma and powder coating. It shows the influence of the cooling speed after built-up metal crystallization on the formation of covering structure components. The paper formulates requirements for operation conditions of plasma and powder coating to provide coverings to be subjected to shock and abrasive wear, and shows the influence of additional heat treatment on formation of structure and properties of the built-up metal. The article under review meets available lacks in studying high-carbon chrome-vanadium coverings and is useful for scientists, graduates, and students investigating the wear resistance coating materials and effective methods for their deposition. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on the geometrically exact elastic {{stability}} analysis of two interacting kinematically constrained, flexible columns. Possible applications are to partially composite or sandwich columns. A partially composite column composed of two inextensible elastically connected sub-columns is considered. Each sub-column is modeled by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and connected to each other via a linear constitutive law for the <b>interlayer</b> slip. The <b>paper</b> discusses the validity of parallel and translational kinematics beam assumptions with respect to the interlayer constraint. Buckling and post-buckling behavior of this structural system are studied for cantilever columns (clamped-free boundary conditions). A variational formulation is presented in order to derive relevant boundary conditions in a geometrically exact framework The exact post-buckling behavior of this partially composite beam-column is investigated analytically and numerically. The Euler elastica problem is obtained in the case of non-composite action. The "partially composite elastica" is then treated analytically and numerically, for various values of the interaction connection parameter. An asymptotic expansion is performed to evaluate the symmetrical pitchfork bifurcation, and comparisons are made with some exact numerical results based on the numerical treatment of the non-linear boundary value problem. A boundary layer phenomenon, similar to that also observed for the linearized bending analysis of partially composite beams, is observed for large values of the connection parameter. This boundary layer phenomenon is investigated with a straightforward asymptotic expansion, that also is valid for large rotations. Finally, the paper analyses the effect of some additional imperfection eccentricities in the loading mode, that lead to some pre-bending phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|MEMS-based {{gas turbine}} engines are {{currently}} under development at MIT {{for use as}} a button-sized portable power generator or micro-aircraft propulsion sources. Power densities expected for the micro-engines require very high rotor peripheral speeds of 300 - 600 m/s and high combustion gas temperatures of 1300 - 1700 K. These harsh requirements for the engine operation induce very high stress levels in the engine structure, and thus call for qualified refractory materials with high strength. Silicon carbide (SiC) has been chosen as the most promising material for use due to its high strength and chemical inertness at elevated temperatures. However, the state-of-the art microfabrication techniques for single-crystal SiC are not yet mature enough to achieve the required level of high precision of micro-engine components. To circumvent this limitation and {{to take advantage of the}} well-established precise silicon microfabrication technologies, silicon-silicon carbide hybrid turbine structures are being developed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thick SiC (up to ~ 70 µm) on silicon wafers and wafer bonding processes. Residual stress control of thick SiC layers is of critical importance to all the silicon-silicon carbide hybrid structure fabrication steps since a high level of residual stresses causes wafer cracking during the planarization, as well as excessive wafer bow, which is detrimental to the subsequent planarization and bonding processes. The origins of the residual stress in CVD SiC layers have been studied. SiC layers (as thick as 30 µm) with low residual stresses (on the order of several tens of MPa) have been produced by controlling CVD process parameters such as temperature and gas ratio. Wafer-level SiC planarization has been accomplished by mechanical polishing using diamond grit and bonding processes are currently under development using CVD silicon dioxide as an <b>interlayer</b> material. This <b>paper</b> reports on the work that has been done so far under the MIT micro-engine project. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|R
