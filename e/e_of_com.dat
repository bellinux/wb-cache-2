40|$|ABSTRACT: Dimensional {{stability}} of fiber board from lignocellulosic materials {{is a prime}} concern for efficient utility of the product. A number of methods {{have been used to}} improve the dimensional stability. These include the application of coating, oil, and wax treatments and chemical modification of lignocellulosic materials. A new process has been developed to minimize irreversible swelling (i. <b>e.,</b> permanent fixation <b>of</b> <b>com</b> pressive deformation <b>of</b> wood fiber through a hygrothermal treatment using in-built steam from moisture of compressed fiber at high temperature). This process has been applied on jute fiber for the evaluation of dimensional stability and vis-&-vis the mechanical and thermal properties of the fiber board made from the modified jute fiber...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe intermolecular {{communication}} within NRPS complexes {{relies on}} the coordinated interplay of donor and acceptor communication-mediating (COM) domains. In this study, the potential <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> domains was exploited in vivo by establishing a system for the true biocombinatorial synthesis of lipopeptides via directed reprogramming of a natural NRP biosynthetic assembly line (i. e., surfactin). By means <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> domain swapping, these experiments verified the decisive role <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> domains for the control of protein-protein interactions between NRPSs, demonstrated the functionality <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> domain pairs even {{in the context of}} a heterologous host and NRPS system, and allowed for the intended skipping of a biosynthetic enzyme within a multienzymatic biosynthetic complex. Ultimately, abrogation of the selectivity barrier provided by COM domains afforded the successful simultaneous, biocombinatorial synthesis of distinct lipopeptide products...|$|R

The role <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 in bladder cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression <b>of</b> the <b>COM</b> 1 protein in human bladder tissues, and also its effect on growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of human bladder cancer cells, in vitro. The expression <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 in human bladder tissues and bladder cancer cell lines was assessed at both the mRNA and protein levels using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. COM 1 staining was compared with tumour staging. Mammalian COM 1 expression construct and anti-COM 1 ribozyme transgenes were used to generate sublines of human bladder cancer cells with differential expression <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1. The effect <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 on cellular functions was examined in bladder cancer cells with which COM 1 was overexpressed or knocked down {{using a variety of}} in vitro assays. In normal bladder tissues, stronger staining <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 was seen in the cytoplasm of normal urothelial cells. In contrast, the staining was notably weak or absent in cancer cells of tumour tissues and invasive tumours had significantly low levels of staining compared with non-invasive tumours (p= 0. 012). Knockdown <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 in bladder cancer cell lines resulted in an increase in cellular growth and invasion, while overexpression <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 suppressed invasiveness and growth of these cells. Further investigation revealed an increased apoptosis and upregulated p 21 in bladder cancer cells when COM 1 was overexpressed. COM 1 is expressed at low levels in human bladder cancer and in particular in invasive bladder tumours. COM 1 levels are inversely correlated with the invasiveness and growth of bladder cancer cells in vitro. Induced apoptosis and upregulation of p 21 are indicated in the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>COM</b> 1 inhibiting bladder cancer cell growth. It suggests that COM 1 is a potential tumour suppressor in human bladder cancer...|$|R
