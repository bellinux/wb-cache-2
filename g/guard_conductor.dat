50|$|CREWS, {{a product}} for {{scheduling}} and managing {{the work of}} staff. CREWS optimises the use of both on-board personnel (drivers, <b>guards,</b> <b>conductors,</b> catering staff, etc.) {{as well as local}} staff (station, contact centre, and railway yard staff, etc.). CREWS produces long-term cyclic schedules (duties and rosters) as well as short-term calendar schedules, taking into account special days of operation and staff’s individual schedules and preferences. It maintains several kinds of individual work time accounts, provides individual inspection of work, and provides standard interfaces to payroll and HR management systems.|$|R
50|$|Abellio Greater Anglia - Most trains {{operating}} out of Liverpool Street are Driver Only Operated {{as far north as}} Colchester, with the exception of trains operated by 'Locomotive Hauled' trains and some trains that operational requirements demand the presence of a <b>Guard</b> / <b>Conductor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Great Western Railway - Most 'Networker' Class 165 and 166 {{operated}} {{services are}} Driver Only trains, operating {{mostly in the}} Thames Valley. For operational reasons 'Networker' services to Basingstoke, Gatwick Airport and services west of Oxford towards Worcester via the Cotswolds are operated with a <b>Guard</b> / <b>Conductor.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1964 <b>conductor</b> <b>guards</b> {{collected}} fares on {{the trains}} and all stations {{on the line}} became unstaffed apart from Haverhill and Sudbury.|$|R
5000|$|... 2008 Chatsworth train {{collision}} - Engineer (Driver) did {{not report}} last two signals as required by rules, but <b>conductor</b> (<b>guard)</b> did not pull tail.|$|R
50|$|Pulled tail is the {{colloquialism}} {{referring to}} the act of a <b>guard</b> or <b>conductor</b> of a railway to apply the emergency brakes when something unexpected has been noticed. This could be an excess of speed in a section of line known to have a lower speed, or strange noises and shaking that might indicate that the train has derailed or something has broken.|$|R
50|$|Train 608 {{drove from}} Liberec via Hradec Králové to Pardubice. It was hauled by the steam {{locomotive}} type 354.7128 {{from the engine}} house Hradec Králové and operated by the train driver and assistant/fireman. Behind the locomotive, were post car type F 9-2236, freight car type Ztr 1-36700, personal car Bi 3-3323, service car Dd 7-2286 a next eight personal cars. The train crew was composed of head <b>guard,</b> senior <b>conductor,</b> junior conductor and train attendant. Train 653 drove from Pardubice to the Hradec Králové at distance 22 kilometers. It was composed of the diesel railcar M 131.1272, four personal cars (Blm 5-2338, Blm 5-2333, BDlm 6-6890, BDlm 6-6899) and another diesel railcar M 131.1327 at the train end. The machine crew was composed of two train drivers accompanied by the head <b>guard</b> and <b>conductor.</b> According train diagram, both trains should have passed in the Stéblová station, which has three tracks. At that time, the station was secured by the mechanical equipment with central interlock and mechanical signals in both directions.|$|R
50|$|Having {{arrived in}} New York City {{early for the}} Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, the Band decided to perform in the library at New York University (NYU). Security <b>guards</b> {{detained}} the <b>Conductor</b> for several minutes and dialed the NYPD. He was promptly released with no consequences.|$|R
50|$|The station {{then became}} part of the Eastern Region of British Railways on {{nationalisation}} in 1948. Eight years later in June 1956 operation of the passenger services were taken over by Diesel Multiple Unit trains with <b>conductor</b> <b>guard</b> operation. Goods services were withdrawn on 30th November 1959.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 January 1967 Fulbourne, Higham, Six Mile Bottom and Saxby & Risby {{stations}} {{closed and}} the remaining minor stations became unstaffed {{with the introduction of}} <b>conductor</b> <b>guard</b> working. [...] On 21 February 1967 the last shunting horse to work on British Rail, [...] "Charlie" [...] at Newmarket retired.|$|R
50|$|Railmotor {{stopping}} place 16 was a stopping {{place on}} the Mornington railway.It was simply a sign beside the railway at a convenient access point near a road. The passenger could hail {{the driver of the}} train to stop, and then would buy a ticket from the <b>guard</b> or the <b>conductor.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 1964 {{the goods}} yard closed with the {{track in the}} bay {{platforms}} being lifted sometime later in the 1960s. In 1967 all booking offices in the area closed and all trains became operated by <b>conductor</b> <b>guards.</b> The late 1960s saw the steady growth of freight through Felixstowe with Freightliner trains being seen increasingly through Westerfield.|$|R
50|$|A Council {{is similar}} in many ways to a Masonic Lodge; it has {{officers}} and a ritual degree system, {{which in this case}} consists of three degrees: Royal Master, Select Master, and Super Excellent Master. The Super Excellent master's degree is optional in some jurisdictions. The various positions in the lodge are modeled directly after Craft Masonry and though the names are often different the duties are largely the same. Their seating is a bit different, however, in that all three principals of a council sit on the east dais, while the captain of the <b>guard</b> and <b>conductor</b> of the council sit in the west and south.|$|R
25|$|In Victoria, Australia, a rail motor {{stopping}} place (RMSP) is {{a location}} on a railway line {{where a small}} passenger vehicle or railmotor can stop to allow passengers to alight. It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway at a convenient access point near a road. The passenger can hail the train driver to stop, and buy a ticket from the <b>guard</b> or the <b>conductor</b> on the train.|$|R
5000|$|High {{platforms}} (usually over 1 meter / 3 feet) are {{a safety}} risk, as people falling onto the tracks have trouble climbing back. Platform screen doors are used on some systems to eliminate this danger. Rapid transit facilities are public spaces and may suffer from security problems: petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and baggage theft, and more serious violent crimes. Security measures include video surveillance, security <b>guards,</b> and <b>conductors.</b> In some countries a specialized transit police may be established. These security measures are normally integrated with {{measures to protect}} revenue by checking that passengers are not travelling without paying. Some subway systems, such as the Beijing Subway, incorporate airport-style security checkpoints at every station. Rapid transit systems {{have been subject to}} terrorism with many casualties, such as the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack and the 2005 [...] "7/7" [...] terrorist bombings on the London Underground.|$|R
5000|$|From September 1966, {{the line}} - which {{had long been}} plagued by an {{imbalance}} between summer and winter patronage - saw the introduction of diesel sets with <b>conductor</b> <b>guards.</b> In reality, this {{was no more than}} a pay train serving weed-infested and vandalised stations. The stations at Gorleston-on-Sea, Hopton, Corton and Lowestoft North were also made unstaffed. In the following year the line was singled and the daily goods pick-up at Lowestoft Central and Yarmouth South Town was discontinued. The last Norfolk and Suffolk signal box at Lowestoft North was also closed, those at Gorleston, Hopton and Corton having already been switched out. By this time, the line was losing £34,000 a year (equivalent to £ in [...] ) and with no through services served only local interests. In the absence of any realistic prospect of traffic improvement, closure came on 4 May 1970. An attempt was made by a local group to purchase the line with a view to running year-round commuter services and summer steam-hauled tourist trains, but this came to nothing.|$|R
50|$|A further 120 {{cars were}} ordered in 1925, with {{both types of}} equipment, {{to cope with the}} opening of the {{junction}} at Kennington and the lengthening of trains to six cars and from 1926, seven cars. Motor cars seated 30 passengers, while trailers had 48 seats. Control trailers had a cab at one end, but no switch compartment, and so seated four less. Trains initially had a crew of three, consisting of a motorman, a front conductor, and a rear guard. The <b>guard</b> signalled the <b>conductor</b> that the train was ready to go, and the conductor signalled the motorman. Once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two. Changes included the fitting of a telephone, so that the guard and motorman could communicate, interlocks to ensure that all doors were closed, and the re-routing of the starting bell, so that it could be operated by a guard at the rear of the train, rather than the conductor at the front. These changes were completed by 1927, allowing the reduction of the train crew.|$|R
50|$|Three trains were {{operated}} in 1981. The first, on 30 May, was a 9 coach Class 37-hauled special to York which carried 455 people. The second, {{operated by the}} Fakenham and Dereham Railway Society, was a DMU special from Ryburgh to the coastal resort of Clacton, which carried 160 people. The third event in 1981 was 'Rail Day' on 19 September. The RDS and WyDRAC chartered a Class 101 DMU {{for the day and}} operated a four-train service between Dereham and Norwich. All crossings were manned, and tickets were issued on the train by <b>conductor</b> <b>guards.</b> 600 passengers used the service, with even the 07.27 service from Norwich to Dereham carrying 5 passengers. On 15 May 1982 a Class 37 and nine coaches left Dereham bound for Matlock in the Derbyshire Dales, carrying 300 people. On 20 June the Fakenham and Dereham Railway Society chartered a DMU from Ryburgh to Norwich, where it joined a DMU special from Sheringham before continuing together to the Nene Valley Railway. 200 passengers travelled on this special. The final train of 1982 ran on 22 August, and was a Class 105 DMU carrying 170 people to Felixstowe.|$|R
