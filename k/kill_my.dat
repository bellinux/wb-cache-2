She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said.

Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not going to share my money with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily <b>kill</b> <b>my</b> parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E

Guthrie recorded another song, [...] "Slipknot", about lynching in Okemah in general: [...] "edicated to the many negro mothers, fathers, and sons alike, that was lynched and hanged under {{the bridge of the}} Canadian River, seven miles south of Okemah, Okla., and to the day when such will be no more" [...] (signed February 29, 1940).

500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart.
