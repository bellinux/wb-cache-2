5|$|The {{industrial}} {{development of the}} Gier valley had its negative aspects. An 1884 writer described the region of Échalas and Saint-Romain-en-Gier, where the country was furrowed by the river, the canal, the railway and the national road. He described the people as the most miserable in the canton of Givors. He said that everything showed this misery: agriculture, roads, houses, church. Work in the mines was the only choice for the poor villagers. An 1885 travel guide mentions the station of Givors-canal on the railway south from Lyon, where the Nîmes line separated from the line to Saint <b>Etienne.</b> The canal then was mainly used by coal barges. The route from Givors-Canal to St. <b>Etienne</b> passed coal mines, large smelting works and iron foundries.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius.

He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that animals had become extinct.|$|E

In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre <b>Étienne</b> Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E

He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
