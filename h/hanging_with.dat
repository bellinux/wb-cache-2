This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew's death. In the game, Ryu can jump, hang, and climb up and down walls with the control pad; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction {{away from the wall}} causes Ryu to spring off the wall. Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button. A new feature introduced in Ninja GaidenIII is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy; he can swing up on top or drop from them, and as with walls, he can only attack enemies while <b>hanging</b> <b>with</b> secondary weapons.|$|E
5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by <b>hanging,</b> <b>with</b> the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

5|$|Before the 13th century, {{instances}} of Europeans going to China or of Chinese going to Europe are virtually unknown, {{with a few}} exceptions. Euthydemus I, Hellenistic ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia during the 3rd century BC, led an expedition into the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China) in search of precious metals. Greek influence as far east as the Tarim Basin at this time {{also seems to be}} confirmed by the discovery of the Sampul tapestry, a woolen wall <b>hanging</b> <b>with</b> the painting of a blue-eyed soldier, possibly a Greek, and a prancing centaur, a common Hellenistic motif from Greek mythology. However, it is known that other Indo-European peoples such as the Yuezhi, Saka, and Tocharians inhabited the Tarim Basin before and after it was brought under Han Chinese influence during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). Lucas Christopoulos presents an argument that the influence of Hellenistic art in China stretches back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), before the establishment of the Silk Road. Christopoulos contends that Hellenistic influences in Chinese art were undoubtedly introduced by the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–265) and the sudden influx of Greco-Buddhist art from the Kushan Empire in Central Asia. Yet ancient ceramics from sites at Khotan bear clear influence from the Hellenistic Kingdom of Ptolemaic Egypt, with styles non-existent in Kushan art. This has led Christopoulos to assume the presence of peoples not only from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom but also Greeks, Saka, and Indian people from the Indo-Greek Kingdom based at Taxila (Pakistan).|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom {{considered}} replacing <b>hanging</b> <b>with</b> {{the electric}} chair (as well as considering the gas chamber and lethal injection) during the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, the findings of which were published in 1953.

25|$|In California, Clinton Duffy, {{who served}} as warden of San Quentin State Prison between 1940 and 1952, presided over ninety executions.

25|$|Citrus {{in central}} Florida did well until the Great Freeze of 1894-5. Many growers {{abandoned}} their groves entirely, but Mead recognized that below ground artesian water {{at a constant}} 70 degrees might provide relief from frost and allow citrus trees to survive freezing temperatures. His engineering background led him to postulate that overhead water irrigation of the trees <b>hanging</b> <b>with</b> fruit could keep the fruit protected from damage at 32° within an ice cocoon regardless of how low the mercury fell. He successfully covered an acre of oranges, installed a pump and irrigation system, and proved the concept, the first known description of a technique still used today.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{not guilty}} verdict, the two Inuit men {{were taken to}} Calgary in late August, where they were found guilty {{of the murder of}} Le Roux. This was the first time Inuit had been found guilty of murder in a Canadian court. The law at that time had a {{mandatory}} sentence of death for the crime of murder, yet the jury and the judge did not wish for the pair to die for their crimes owing to the provocative nature of the priests' actions before their deaths. To avoid the death penalty, the judge sentenced the pair to death by <b>hanging,</b> <b>with</b> the execution date set as October 15. The sentence was immediately commuted to life imprisonment at a Fort Resolution police station. In 1919, the pair assisted police in establishing a new police contingent at Tree River, and in 1922 were released.|$|E

500|$|Hanging, {{drawing and}} {{quartering}} was abolished in England by the Forfeiture Act 1870, Liberal politician Charles Forster's second attempt since 1864 {{to end the}} forfeiture of a felon's lands and goods (thereby not making paupers of his family). [...] The Act limited the penalty for treason to hanging alone, although it did not remove the monarch's right under the 1814 Act to replace <b>hanging</b> <b>with</b> beheading. Beheading was abolished in 1973, although it had long been obsolete. [...] The death penalty for treason was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, enabling the UK to ratify protocol six of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1999.|$|E

As a young man, Rivera played soccer and baseball with his friends on the beach during low tide. Soccer was his favorite sport, while his favorite athlete was Pelé. For baseball games, they substituted cardboard milk cartons for gloves and tree branches for bats, and they fashioned balls by taping worn-out baseballs and wads of shredded fishing nets. Rivera used this makeshift equipment until his father bought him his first leather glove when he was 12 years old.
