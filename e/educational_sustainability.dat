In this article, we explore the meaning of two rather new and unfamiliar moral competencies in the field of corporate sustainability: normative competence and action competence. Because sustainability {{can be seen as a}} highly complex or ‘wicked’ problem, it is unclear what ‘normativity’ in the normative competence and ‘responsible action’ in the action competence actually mean. In this article, we raise the question how both these moral competencies have to be understood and how they are related to each other. We argue for a virtue ethics perspective on both moral competencies, because this perspective is able to take the wickedness of sustainability into account. It turns out that virtue ethics enables us to conceptualize normative competence and action competence as two aspects of one virtuous competence for sustainabilit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Scholars write {{scholarly}} {{articles to}} introduce new concepts and ideas. Unfortunately, not every learner or reader can understand every scholar’s work. One {{reason for this}} is that the language used in papers is profound, hence many learners find it difficult to cope with the language and understand the ideas put forward in papers. To overcome this problem, our focus in this research is to develop a teaching-based technique to guide learners toward a better way of understanding and learning from scholarly articles. The technique in this paper is validated in case studies with the support of evidence that shows it is a proof of learning concept which has significantly contributed to guiding students to better practice in their learning. In addition, the use of this technique helps to promote <b>educational</b> <b>sustainability</b> by developing students ’ interest in appreciating and understanding scholarly articles.

The outcome of these endeavors has, in a way, favored {{the reduction of}} ‘unemployment and unemployables’ syndromes and engendered sustainability {{in the face of}} economic development forces.

The Nigerian education policy (NPE) stakeholders need to consider the upsurge of some other policy statements and intentions by other interest groups; which include the education strategic Plan for tertiary institution in Nigeria (ESP), ‘education for all’ (EFA), Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Vision 20 : 2020, and Decades on Education for Sustainable Development (DESD 2005 - 2014).

40|$|In {{the higher}} {{education}} sector, a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are playing {{a leading role in}} promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and <b>educational</b> <b>sustainability.</b> In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability. HEIs face a number of challenges in effectively managing sustainability information, such as siloed data and information, and poor sharing and communication of information. Business Intelligence (BI) can assist in overcoming many of the challenges faced by organisations in effectively managing strategic sustainability information. This study investigates both the constraints to effective sustainability information management and the challenges of BI. A BI framework to support effective strategic sustainability information management is proposed. Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) is one such HEI, which is affected by the challenges of managing strategic sustainability information. NMMU is therefore used as a case study in this research. A BI solution, Sustainable BI, was developed based on the proposed framework. The main goal of sustainable BI is to provide strategic management at NMMU with a tool that can provide integrated sustainability information that can assist in overcoming the challenges in effectively managing strategic sustainability information. Sustainable BI was evaluated by strategic management at NMMU who are responsible for managing sustainability at NMMU. The evaluation took place through a usability study.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the {{specific}} criteria {{that are currently}} being introduced in Norwegian teaching and assessment of writing, as well as selected aspects of their development. The article builds on an assumption that assessment criteria have such educational importance that even their origins, intellectual trajectories and underpinnings should be given attention in educational research. In this context, the article presents elements of a rare approach, in that national ‘norms of expected proficiency’ at politically predefined educational grade levels have been grounded in sustained collaboration with experienced teachers of writing across the curriculum, and may thus be viewed as yet unofficial ‘standards’. In the first step, a combination of existing curricula and literature review of writer development was used to tentatively draft a first set of criteria for the grades included in a 2005 national test of writing (grades 4, 7, 10 and 11). In the second step, such criteria were developed through an iterative, long-term process where initial criteria were confronted with the judgements of experienced teachers. Through ‘think aloud’ assessment interviews, pairs of teachers across Norway were asked to assess specific cases of students’ writings and voice criteria for their judgements, both within and across a series of domains. In the third step, interview transcripts were used to search for criteria used by several pairs of locally situated teachers across geographically distributed schools. Criteria thus identified were pooled into a refined set of ‘national standards’ that were subsequently tested out in everyday classroom contexts. On {{the basis of this}} confrontation with educational reality, the set has been further refined to form the version presented in this article. The Norwegian case raises a range of issues related to curriculum development, ‘standards’ and <b>educational</b> <b>sustainability...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper questions {{how we can}} enrich and enhance the international and cross-cultural diversity perspectives of curricula in graphic design education? In a period of constant educational change and global education opportunities (UNESCO) {{it is apparent that}} staff and students need to re-position themselves and be reminded that ‘the development of a culturally sensitive learning environment should be viewed as a shared responsibility amongst teachers, developers, administrators and learners’, which involves consultation of participants to ensure a rich and purposeful model is being developed’. (GOODEAR, 2001). This is both an opportunity and necessity in enabling UK and international design students to proactively learn, culturally liberate themselves and subsequently develop invaluable transferable design skills in a global economy. There are educational dangers if we are not proactive in developing sustainable cross-cultural pedagogies in our education environments ‘the sanitizing of cultural differences has the potential to limit the educational opportunities that can be found in culturally diverse learning environments’. (GOODEAR, 2001). This paper will offer practical and theoretical insights by proposing an educational model developed by the author ‘the seven c’s’; consisting of cross-cultural, communication, collaboration, commerce, creativity, cross-disciplinary and community. The model has been developed working within an international educational environment at postgraduate level consisting of students from the ‘seven seas’, represented from countries as diverse as Qatar to China. Contextually the research builds on and openly questions the cross-cultural work outside of design by Tromepnaars, Hofstede, alongside initiatives by UNESCO on the global citizen and <b>educational</b> <b>sustainability.</b> It also engages with cultural design debates initiated at the Seattle ICOGRADA conference and issues in graphic design of the global/local (TWEMLOW). The research is also informed by previous cross-cultural work by designers Tenazas and Steiner. Clearly, design needs to develop its own research and practices within cross-cultural contexts. The paper illustrates an educational cross-cultural working process specifically for the subject of design and particularly graphic design. The paper highlights how an active model can be developed through learning by doing (GIBBS, 1998) and thinking (RAMSDEN, 2003) however, coming from a perspective which addresses creativity across cultures (LUBART), cross-disciplinary and importantly by a practice-based collaborative international team project approach. The research methodology is predominantly an action research one through problem-solving. It is also situated within a pedagogic research-informed teaching approach where teaching draws upon enquiry into the teaching and learning process itself (JENKINS AND HEALEY, 2005). Methods incorporated have been cross-cultural international focus groups attended by students, interviews and student case studies. The practical pedagogic findings will be of use to anyone working in design education wishing to develop cross-cultural curricula. The paper will be contextualized and presented through student project images and a short film by the author entitled: ‘research is like a pair of scissors’, which derives from a Japanese student questioning design research...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of <b>educational</b> {{programs}} in <b>sustainability</b> science has paralleled {{the rise of the}} field itself. The educational approach of these programs follows the problem-driven, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary nature of the field itself. However, its effectiveness has yet to be systematically evaluated. Similarly, while ad-hoc evaluation schemes have attempted to monitor the quality of the educational programs, there is no standard method that accounts for the particularities of sustainability science programs. This study thus addresses the need for an assessment of the problem-driven approach of <b>educational</b> programs in <b>sustainability</b> science. We have conducted student self-assessments of field courses in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS-GLI) at The University of Tokyo, which positions its field courses at the center of its curriculum. The self-assessments were based on five key competencies identified as particularly important for sustainability professionals. Workshops and questionnaires engaged students in a reflection of the six field courses and of their own personal development through the activities offered. Our questionnaire results indicate that the majority of participants were satisfied with how the courses furthered their personal development. While some participants expressed frustration at being unable to sufficiently address the respective field's sustainability challenges due to time constraints, students generally recognized the five key competencies as important for addressing sustainability issues after participating in the courses. Moreover, participants attributed much of their learning to their active engagement in planned field research activities, rather than to passive learning. Variations in results across different course units provide material for further analysis and development of the curriculum. This study is an initial attempt at assessment, with room for ongoing improvement and further research to address additional requirements for fostering the next generation of sustainability professionals...|$|R

In addition, the importance of effective and sufficient guidance and parental participation was highlighted. In a change to the Turkish educational system in 2014, the authority and responsibility of supervision was assigned to the school principals. Because it would decrease the psychological pressure that supervision imposes on educational workers, and enable a positive atmosphere for communication over a prolonged period, this change was believed to be beneficial overall.

The paper revisits startling results from large scale international studies that show the dissonance between young people’s sustainability knowledge and the resistance of young people to put into practice. The reluctance to enact sustainability knowledge necessitates a review of current teaching practices as these raise important issues about current models of education and how sustainability is captured within education. Education about sustainability seeks to future proof our society through the teaching and learning of actions that ensure our collective long term future. For this reason teaching about sustainability incorporates a focus on social responsibility as well as individual responsibility.   This paper examines the notion of agency as a critical component in the understanding of how behavior and actions are organized and integrated by students. Agency theory is highly sensitized towards these learner demands as it provides educators with ways to appraise and make judgment upon content as well as guiding learner’s actions.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} public {{expectation}} that universities should start focusing on delivering sustainability. The topic of sustainability in higher education has gathered {{a significant amount of}} interest from students, academics, governments and international organizations.

Ultimately, students are the ones using these sustainability marketing materials to assist in their decision at which institution they will pursue their studies. The sheer volume of interpretations of the word sustainability with regards to higher education institution leaves ample room for potentially misguided initiatives or marketing. A universal system for assessing a higher <b>educational</b> institution’s <b>sustainability</b> has not been translated into a measurable reality. It is proposed that a universal system would help create a common understanding of sustainability within higher education institutions and would help in stakeholder understanding, institutional accountability and impactful application of sustainable initiatives. This research looked to answer if a holistic framework could be created that would aid stakeholders in reviewing a university’s level of sustainability. And, if so, if this vision of a fully sustainable university could be translated into a measurable reality. The research was approached in a structured way. Each chapter represents a published and peer-reviewed step towards addressing if a holistic framework could be created that would aid students in reviewing sustainability tools, assessments and marketing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports the}} {{entrepreneurial}} activities of two university faculties, one Canadian {{and the other}} Australian, that were {{designed to meet the}} educational needs of students and to garner the resources necessary for program delivery. A conceptual framework for educational entrepreneurship, containing six dimensions, is proposed. The dimensions are: innovative behavior, networking, time-space communication framework, local-global perspective, educational organizations as knowledge centers, and integrated face-to-face and Internet-based learning. Major considerations suggested for entrepreneurial initiatives include access, equity, quality, and <b>sustainability.</b> <b>Educational</b> entrepreneurship is defined as the strategic focus on creating short and long-term opportunities for learning that will make a significant difference for individuals and their societies. Elements of educational entrepreneurship highlighted are strategic planning, the capacity to make responsible but timely decisions, business acumen, faculty development, and strategic alliances. Entrepreneurial leadership must be found among academic and support staff, as well as students. Impact on students is discussed. Other lessons learned include the need for a multi-faced approach to institutional change that incorporates a clearly articulated educational vision, well developed policies and procedures to guide action, sustainable funding plans, and evidence-based practices. Although educational entrepreneurship is reported to be difficult to achieve and seen as vulnerable to changes in personnel and political influences from within the organization and beyond, it is seen as providing a more equitable access to graduate studies and promoting growth in social and human capacity...|$|R
40|$|Through {{its impact}} on the built environment, {{construction}} plays {{a central role in the}} UK government’s drive to promote sustainable growth and development. Therefore, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a growing area of interest for engineering and design consulting firms, such as WSP, within the construction industry as their stakeholder bases expand and expectations regarding the firm’s conduct also rise. This paper investigates WSP’s approach to CSR by addressing the following three questions:  What constitutes a CSR in the engineering design consulting industry?  Can CSR be an <b>educational</b> mechanism for <b>sustainability?</b>  What factors influence the emergence of strategic CSR activities in implementing sustainability policy These questions explore how the WSP’s CSR strategy assists the company in thinking ‘outside-in’ about how it creates and sustains competitive advantage. Outside-in thinking, which sees the world from the perspective of stakeholders, is a powerful new lens through which the company’s leadership can discover new business opportunities and risks. I argue that the company can better anticipate changes in the business environment if it proactively addresses stakeholder issues by integrating its market issues with non-market issues which ultimately can lead the company to discover new sources of value through innovation and to achieve its sustainability goals. The paper finds that Michael Porter’s work of the 1980 ’s, ‘Competitive Strategies’, is a method that has been utilized by WSP to enhance CSR practices for the organization, through strategic CSR development...|$|R
