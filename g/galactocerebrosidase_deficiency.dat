We report {{a case in}} whom the clinical features were similar to motor neurone disease. Nerve conduction studies and neuroimaging were important in leading to the correct diagnosis.

40|$|Background: Krabbe disease (KD) or globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} lysosomal disorder, which affects metabolic and neurologic systems. This pathology has different forms. Infantile onset is about 85 % to 90 % of individuals with Krabbe disease. Disorder’s onset is characterized, in early childhood, by hyperirritability, psychomotor deterioration associated to episodes of fever. To date, all reported cases {{have been attributed to}} mutations in galactosylceramidase gene (GALC gene) that encodes an enzyme which degrades galactosyl-sphingolipids (galactosylceramide, psychosine), essential in myelin production. A child compounded with two new mutations in the GALC gene was detected. Case presentation: An eleven month old male child of Moroccan origin presented to our genetic consultation with severe symptoms that included hypotonia, fever, vision loss and feeding difficulties. He was suffering from the 4 th month of life. Krabbe disease was suspected. <b>Galactocerebrosidase</b> <b>deficiency</b> was confirmed by biochemical analysis. DNA sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous compound mutation in GALC gene. The child was compounded with two mutations c. 860 G> A; p. Cys 287 Tyr and c. 1622 G> A; p. Trp 541 *. Conclusion: These new mutations could affect GALC structure and therefore its function. The identification of these mutations and their associated phenotypes are important to predict the prognosis and to confer to families an adequate genetic counseling...|$|E
