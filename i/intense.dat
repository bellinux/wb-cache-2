5|$|Hurricane Kenna is {{currently}} {{tied with a}} hurricane in 1957 and the 1959 Mexico hurricane as the third most <b>intense</b> Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico. The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at a greater intensity were Patricia of 2015 and Madeline of 1976. Kenna is the third most <b>intense</b> October tropical cyclone to {{have occurred in the}} East Pacific, and is the fourth most <b>intense</b> East Pacific hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Patricia of 2015, Hurricane Linda of 1997 and Hurricane Rick of 2009.|$|E

5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any <b>intense</b> surface heat source. Those that occur near <b>intense</b> {{wildfires}} are called fire whirls. They {{are not considered}} tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are {{not as strong as}} tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.|$|E

5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of <b>intense</b> marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of <b>intense</b> surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most <b>intense</b> from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most <b>intense</b> June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
