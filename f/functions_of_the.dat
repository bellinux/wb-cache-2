5|$|Although El Hatillo {{has been}} {{independent}} from Petare since 1809, it later {{became part of}} Sucre Municipality, where Petare is located. On November 19, 1991, Miranda's Legislative Assembly gave El Hatillo full autonomy, making it an independent municipality; this decision was issued in Gaceta Oficial on January 17, 1992. In 1993, Mercedes Hernández de Silva was elected the first mayor of El Hatillo. Since 2000, the Alcaldía Mayor manages some of the <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E

5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined the <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dumaresq {{and the range}} clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, {{was assigned to the}} ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{methods of}} {{observation}} included dissection (Aristotle's lost companion work, The Dissections, contained illustrations of these), so he observed animal anatomy directly, though his {{interpretations of the}} <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures he observed were subject to error.

5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{the area}} {{contained}} the separate settlements of Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Halton, Weston, Weston Point, and Norton.

The population increase associated with industrialisation resulted in considerable expansion, {{so that the}} formerly discrete settlements were absorbed into the current urban area, much of which dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E
