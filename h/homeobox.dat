5|$|Most of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis {{are members of the}} <b>homeobox</b> gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx <b>homeobox</b> genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|Hox genes {{determine}} where repeating parts, {{such as the}} many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Pax-6, already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene. <b>Homeobox</b> genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} much of the {{morphogenesis}} of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the <b>homeobox</b> genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of evolutionary developmental biology towards understanding how the various body plans of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the <b>Homeobox</b> (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the <b>homeobox</b> genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the <b>homeobox</b> protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that miR-181 targets the <b>homeobox</b> protein Hox-A11 and participates in {{establishing}} muscle tissue downregulating it (a repressor of the differentiation process in mammalians and lower organisms).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that miR-181a binds the 3' UTR of Prox1 leading to {{translation}} repression and transcript degradation. Prox1 is a <b>homeobox</b> transcription factor involved in development of the lymphatic endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Interaction between <b>homeobox</b> protein NANOG and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) {{has been}} shown to be {{important}} in establishing pluripotency during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. QSER1 protein was shown to interact with both NANOG and TET1.|$|E
25|$|An adult penis with an erect {{length of}} less than 7cm or 2.76inches but {{otherwise}} formed normally is referred to in a medical context as having the micropenis condition. The condition affects 0.6% of men. Some of the identifiable causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity, a variety of genetic syndromes, and variations in certain <b>homeobox</b> genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood. Operations are also available to increase penis size in cases of micropenis in adults.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes {{that are involved in}} the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the <b>homeobox</b> msx family during development and regeneration.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} genes like <b>homeobox</b> (Hox a and d) genes {{which may have}} a role in {{regulating}} penis size. In humans, the AR gene located on the X chromosome at Xq11-12 which may determine the penis size. The SRY Gene located on Y chromosome may have a role to play. Variance in size can often be attributed to de-novo mutations. Deficiency of pituitary growth hormone or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity can cause small penis size in males and is treated with can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that conserved miR-181 family were {{upregulated}} in EpCAM+ AFP+ Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and EpCAM+ HCC isolated from AFP+ tumors. In addition, miR-181 family members were highly expressed in the embryonic liver and isolated hepatic stem cells. Especially, inhibition of miR-181 leads to a reduction of the EpCAM+, the amount of HCC cells and initiate tumor capacity, whereas exogenous miR-181 expression in HCC cells resulted in an enrichment of EpCAM+ HCC cells. miR-181 could directly target hepatic transcriptional regulators of differentiation (like <b>homeobox</b> 2 CDX2 and 6 GATA proteins binding GATA6) and an inhibitor of Wnt / beta-catenin. It suggests that miR-181 may eradicate HCC.|$|E
500|$|To date, {{little effort}} {{has been applied to}} the direct study of {{transcriptional}} regulation of CASS4. [...] The SABiosciences’ DECODE database, based on the UCSC Bioinformatics Genome Browser, proposes several transcriptional regulators for CASS4 based on its promotor region sequence: NF-κβ, p53, LCR-F1 (NFE2-L1, nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like1), MAX1, C/EBPα, CHOP-10 (C/EBP homologous protein 10), POU3F1 (POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 1, aka Oct-6), Areb6 (ZEB1, Zinc finger E-box binding <b>homeobox</b> 1). [...] These are compatible with regulation relevant to lymphocytes and deregulation in cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Retinoic acid via the {{retinoic acid}} {{receptor}} influences {{the process of}} cell differentiation, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomers and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover {{the same amount of}} space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of <b>Homeobox</b> (Hox) genes which encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type specific genes. Deletion of the <b>Homeobox</b> (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. [...] Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} {{distinct}} progenitor domains in the ventral neural tube, viz. V3 interneuron, motor neurons (MN), V2, V1, and V0 interneurons (in ventral to dorsal order). These different progenitor domains are established by [...] "communication" [...] between different classes of <b>homeobox</b> transcription factors. (See Trigeminal nerve.) These transcription factors respond to SHH gradient concentration. Depending upon {{the nature of}} their interaction with SHH, they are classified into two groups, class I and class II, and are composed of members from the Pax, Nkx, Dbx, and Irx families. Class I proteins are repressed at different thresholds of SHH, delineating ventral boundaries of progenitor domains; while class II proteins are activated at different thresholds of SHH, delineating the dorsal limit of domains. Selective cross-repressive interactions between class I and class II proteins give rise to five cardinal ventral neuronal subtypes.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} occurs due {{to chronic}} inflammation. [...] The principal {{cause of the}} chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). [...] In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to {{the cells of the}} lower esophagus. Recently, bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [...] and the protein kinase enzyme Akt. This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex NF-κB (NFKB1), and ultimately activation of the <b>homeobox</b> gene CDX2, which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as guanylate cyclase 2C. This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.|$|E
2500|$|TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors (often {{referred}} to as TALEs, but {{not to be confused}} with the three amino acid loop extension <b>homeobox</b> sub-family of proteins) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. [...] These proteins can bind promoter sequences in the host plant and activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection. [...] They recognize plant DNA sequences through a central repeat domain consisting of a variable number of ~34 amino acid repeats. [...] There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [...] These proteins are interesting to researchers both for their role in disease of important crop species and the relative ease of retargeting them to bind new DNA sequences. [...] Similar proteins can be found in the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and Burkholderia rhizoxinica., as well as yet unidentified marine microorganisms. The term TALE-likes is used to refer to the putative protein family encompassing the TALEs and these related proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the <b>homeobox</b> protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a negative regulator for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E
