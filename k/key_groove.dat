A review on the existing speed measurement methods of rotary machine was proposed {{to find out the}} defects of each method. A new approach was introduced to fulfill steam turbine speed accurate measuring. The periods of phase signal pulse generated by the <b>key</b> <b>groove</b> and speed signal pulse generated by the velocimetry gear, were measured respectively by the two independent 16 -bit timer/counters, and the "counter overflow " problem was resolved by calling a byte memory unit. According to the record number of the counter, the value of steam turbine speed was calculated accurately. The method of steam turbine speed measurement proposed in this paper can not only simplify the structure of a TDM system, but also reduce its cost...|$|E

By comparing the methylation interference patterns of different sites, performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with IC-substituted oligonucleotides and competition experiments with the minor groove binding (MGB) drugs distamicin A, tallimustine and Hoechst 33258 we show that NF-Y makes <b>key</b> minor <b>groove</b> interactions. Circular permutation assays on four CCAAT boxes, MHC Class II Ea, HSP 70, epsilon-globin and MSV, indicate that NF-Y is able to distort the double helix by angles of 62 - 82 degrees, depending on the site used, and suggest that nucleotides flanking the CCAAT pentanucleotide influence the degree of bending...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the design and {{evaluation}} of a robust drive mechanism intended to robotically steer a thermal ablation electrode. The device is intended to enable more efficient kidney tumor ablation therapy guided by CT scanning. The steering mechanism {{is based on the}} concept of substantially straightening a pre-curved Nitinol stylet by retracting it into a concentric outer cannula, and re-deploying it at a different position. A drive mechanism was previously designed to actuate the cannula and stylet motions. While successfully demonstrating the concept, the previous prototype used a screw-spline mechanism that had a <b>key</b> and <b>groove</b> that were difficult to manufacture, assemble and align. To address the issue of the key being misaligned with the spline nut, an alternative, more robust means was considered for constraining the screw-spline from rotating.

The {{stress and strain}} on the surfaces of a rolling bearing has an important significance in bearing lifespan estimate, fault analysis, and stiffness calculation. Aimed at the contact problem of a {{deep groove ball bearing}} based on ANSYS, this paper mainly discusses three technologies, viz., parameterized modeling technology, division technology, and meshing technology, to provide a new method for setting the contact parameters in the process of finite-element analysis.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{specially}} designed grooved heat pipe charged with nanofluids {{was investigated in}} terms of various parameters such as heat transfer rate (50 - 300 W with 50 W interval), volume concentration (0. 005 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and hybrid combinations), inclination (5 °, 45 °, 90 °), cooling water temperature (1 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C), surface state, transient state and so on. Hybrid nanofluids with different volume concentration ratios with Ag-H 2 O and Al 2 O 3 -H 2 O were used as working fluids on a grooved heat pipe. Comparing with the pure water system, nanofluidic and hybrid nanofluidic systems shows greater overall thermal resistance with increasing nano-particle concentration. Also hybrid nanofluids make the system deteriorate in terms of thermal resistance. The post nanofluid experimental data regarding grooved heat pipe show that the heat transfer performance {{is similar to the}} results of nanofluid system. The thermal performance of a grooved heat pipe with nanofluids and hybrid nanofluids were varied with driving parameters but they led to worse system performance. <b>Key</b> words: <b>grooved</b> heat pipe, nanofluids, heat transfe...|$|R
50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's <b>keys,</b> taper pins, <b>grooved</b> fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, rail lubricators and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed free machining steels containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|R

40|$|We {{synthesized}} fluorescently labeled 16 -unit linear and cyclic peptides with sequences {{found in}} b-hairpins with four-residue loops; in the cyclic peptide the hairpin was stabilized by an S-S bond between two cysteines. The two peptides {{were shown to}} form two types of complex with DNA, with stoichiometry of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 per binding site of four base pairs. For the linear peptide, the DNA titration curve depended on the solvent, and in 20 % trifluoroethanol was S-shaped, suggesting cooperative binding. For the cyclic peptide the titration curve was S-shaped without TFE {{as well as in}} 20 % TFE and 20 % methanol. The thermodynamic parameters of peptide binding were determined without and with 20 % TFE. The cyclic peptide preferred poly(dG) •poly(dC) to poly(dA) •poly(dT) and poly[d(GC) ]•poly[d(GC) ]; the former complex persisted to 0. 06 M NaCl whereas the latter two dissociated at 0. 04 M. The linear peptide formed a tighter complex with poly(dG) •poly(dC) than its cyclic counterpart. Both peptides were shown to compete for binding sites on poly(dA) •poly(dT) with distamycin A and its analog binding in the DNA minor <b>groove.</b> <b>Key</b> words: DNA-binding peptides; two-strand peptide motif; b-hairpin construction; cooperative effect...|$|R

This was achieved through the design of a new profiled threaded shaft and nut that reduced the part count and simplified manufacturing and assembly. To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape, an analytical expression was derived that related the tolerance between the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using SolidWorks. A deterministic design process was then followed to size the actuators and transmissions for such drive mechanisms given a set of specifications for cannula/stylet force and speed. Specifically, the gear train was designed to ensure sufficient force for deploying a pre-curved needle from a cannula and into a gelatinous solid based on previously collected experimental data. Using this process, Faulhaber AM 1524 micro-stepper motors with 15 A planetary gearheads were selected that could provide 10 N and 20 N of force to both the cannula and stylet (in line with the screws) at a speed of 7 mm/s. Accuracy and repeatability of the drive mechanism were measured in a bench-top experiment using calipers and a protractor and yielded sub-mm values for translation and approximately two degrees of play for rotation. Targeting experiments were also performed in ballistics gelatin and ex-vivo tissue samples where the distal tip of the stylet was recorded with a camera and CT scanner and demonstrated that the device is ready for testing with an integrated thermal ablation system. by Carmen Marten-Ellis Graves.

40|$|The first {{genome-wide}} scans {{searching for}} follicular lymphoma (FL) risk factors {{revealed that a}} section of chromosome 6 powerfully impacts risk of this disease. Common genetic variants within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene region were shown {{to be associated with}} an approximate doubling of individual disease odds. This dissertation aims to concurrently improve the resolution of, expand upon, clarify, and take the first steps in explaining these findings. Chapter 1 provides a review of the broadly relevant literature, including the epidemiology of FL and related lymphomas, the molecular immunology of FL, and the HLA gene region. Chapter 2 is a study making use of the highest possible resolution HLA genotyping methodology for its time, applied to an FL case-control study. This study not only increased our knowledge of known risk factors, it also was the first study to demonstrate an association of FL with variation at HLA-DPB 1. Chapter 3 describes the method which will soon be used to localize to a single locus the associations which are ambiguously assigned to several genes. Using pilot data, this study demonstrate the feasibility of performing genetic ancestry matching and HLA imputations on historically stored samples. Chapter 4 uses data from several studies to identify two amino-acid positions, which may themselves explain a substantial portion of FL risk. The fact that these amino acid positions lie in the <b>key</b> peptide binding <b>groove</b> of HLA-DRB 1 gives some evidence that peptide binding is the mechanism by which these HLA associations are impacting FL development. Finally, in Chapter 5 the peptide binding properties of HLA class II alleles are computationally investigated, examining potential environmental and internal proteomes likely to be encountered by HLA proteins. This approach reveals that certain alleles which impact FL risk are predicted to be exceptionally strong or weak at binding peptides, and several candidate antigens are mined from the data. Concluding in Chapter 6, the state of HLA-FL research is summarized, and future research is recommended...|$|R
