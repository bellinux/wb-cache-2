5|$|The {{first player}} born in Puerto Rico {{who played in}} MLB was Hiram Bithorn, who debuted as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs on April 15, 1942. This was {{followed}} by the introduction of African American players in Major League Baseball, which allowed more chances to players born in the island. Subsequently, Afro-Puerto Rican players such as Orlando Cepeda and Victor Pellot Power began having solid performances in the league, and were selected to participate in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In , Roberto Clemente became the first player from Puerto Rico and first Latin American to be elected {{as a member of the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Since then Puerto Rico <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> stable amount of players in the league. During this timeframe, several players have been selected to participate in the All-Star Game or won awards for their performance, while others imposed records within the league. These include Javy López, who holds the record for most home runs hit by a catcher in a single season. Both Iván Rodríguez and Roberto Alomar hold the record for most Gold Glove Awards in their positions.

500|$|Bachelard {{discusses}} the Australian {{branch of the}} Exclusive Brethren that was formed approximately 200 years ago by John Nelson Darby of Ireland. The introduction emphasises the point that intense investigation should {{not be seen as}} vilification of the organisation. He writes that since the organisation's beginnings in Ireland in 1827, it has maintained that the world external to the group is evil, and <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> [...] "doctrine of separation" [...] from non-members. Since 2002, Bruce Hales served as the international leader and [...] "Elect Vessel" [...] of the organisation, which has 15,000 members in Australia and 43,000 total globally. The author describes the beliefs and practices and doctrine of the organisation, including its approaches to business and finance, as well as its methodology with respect to charity, Sunday services, and preparing the dead for burial.

2500|$|The Commitment is a {{quarterly}} newsletter magazine sent to parents of students, alumni {{and friends of}} Los Angeles Baptist High School.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{source code}} {{for the current}} TeX software is written in WEB, a mixture of documentation written in TeX and a Pascal subset {{in order to ensure}} portability. For example, TeX does all of its dynamic allocation itself from fixed-size arrays and uses only fixed-point arithmetic for its internal calculations. As a result, TeX has been ported to almost all operating systems, usually by using the web2c program to convert the source code into C instead of directly compiling the Pascal code. Knuth <b>has</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> very detailed log of all the bugs he has corrected and changes he has made in the program since 1982; , the list contains 427 entries, not including the version modification that should be done after his death as the final change in TeX. Donald Knuth offers monetary awards to people who find and report a bug in TeX. The award per bug started at US$2.56 (one [...] "hexadecimal dollar") and doubled every year until it was frozen at its current value of $327.68. Knuth has lost relatively little money as there have been very few bugs claimed. In addition, recipients have been known to frame their check as proof that they found a bug in TeX rather than cashing it.|$|E
