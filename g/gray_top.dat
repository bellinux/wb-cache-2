6000|$|Mayday {{afternoon}} in Oxford Street, and Felix Freeland, a little late, {{on his way}} from Hampstead to his brother John's house in Porchester Gardens. Felix Freeland, author, wearing the very first <b>gray</b> <b>top</b> hat of the season. A compromise, that--like many other things {{in his life and}} works--between individuality and the accepted view of things, aestheticism and fashion, the critical sense and authority. After the meeting at John's, to discuss the doings of the family of his brother Morton Freeland--better known as Tod--he would perhaps look in on the caricatures at the English Gallery, and visit one duchess in Mayfair, concerning the George Richard Memorial. And so, not the soft felt hat which really suited authorship, nor the black top hat which obliterated personality to the point of pain, but this gray thing with narrowish black band, very suitable, in truth, to a face of a pale buff color, to a moustache of a deep buff color streaked with a few gray hairs, to a black braided coat cut away from a buff-colored waistcoat, to his neat boots--not patent leather--faintly buffed with May-day dust. Even his eyes, Freeland gray, were a little buffed over by sedentary habit, and the number of things that he was conscious of. For instance, that the people passing him were distressingly plain, both men and women; plain with the particular plainness of those quite unaware of it. It struck him forcibly, while he went along, how very queer it was that with so many plain people in the country, the population managed to keep up even as well as it did. To his wonderfully keen sense of defect, it seemed little short of marvellous. A shambling, shoddy crew, this crowd of shoppers and labor demonstrators! A conglomeration of hopelessly mediocre visages! What was to be done about it? Ah! what indeed!--since they were evidently not aware of their own dismal mediocrity. Hardly a beautiful or a vivid face, hardly a wicked one, never anything transfigured, passionate, terrible, or grand. Nothing Greek, early Italian, Elizabethan, not even beefy, beery, broad old Georgian. Something clutched-in, and squashed-out about it all--on that collective face something of the look of a man almost comfortably and warmly wrapped round by a snake {{at the very beginning of}} its squeeze. It gave Felix Freeland a sort of faint excitement and pleasure to notice this. For it was his business to notice things, and embalm them afterward in ink. And he believed that not many people noticed it, so that it contributed in his mind to his own distinction, which was precious to him. Precious, and encouraged to be so by the press, which--as he well knew--must print his name several thousand times a year. And yet, as a man of culture and of principle, how he despised that kind of fame, and theoretically believed that a man's real distinction lay in his oblivion of the world's opinion, particularly as expressed by that flighty creature, the Fourth Estate. But here again, as in the matter of the <b>gray</b> <b>top</b> hat, he had instinctively compromised, taking in press cuttings which described himself and his works, while he never failed to describe those descriptions--good, bad, and indifferent--as 'that stuff,' and their writers as 'those fellows.' ...|$|E

Here groups of young men, with chivalrous idealism, were jeering at and chivying the broken {{remnants of a}} suffrage meeting. Felix debated whether he should oppose his body to their bodies, his tongue to theirs, or whether he should avert his consciousness and hurry on; but, that instinct which moved him to wear the <b>gray</b> <b>top</b> hat prevailing, he did neither, and stood instead, looking at them in silent anger, which quickly provoked endearments--such as: [...] "Take it off," [...] or [...] "Keep it on," [...] or [...] "What cheer, Toppy!" [...] but nothing more acute. And he meditated: Culture! Could culture ever make headway among the blind partisanships, the hand-to-mouth mentality, the cheap excitements of this town life? The faces of these youths, the tone of their voices, the very look of their bowler hats, said: No! You could not culturalize the impermeable texture of their vulgarity. And they were the coming manhood of the nation--this inexpressibly distasteful lot of youths! The country had indeed got {{too far away from}} 'the Land.' And this essential towny commonness was not confined to the classes from which these youths were drawn. He had even remarked it among his own son's school and college friends--an impatience of discipline, an insensibility to everything but excitement and having a good time, a permanent mental indigestion due to a permanent diet of tit-bits. What aspiration they possessed seemed devoted to securing for themselves the plums of official or industrial life. His boy Alan, even, was infected, in spite of home influences and the atmosphere of art in which he had been so sedulously soaked. He wished to enter his Uncle Stanley's plough works, seeing in it a 'soft thing.' ...|$|E

TYPE SPECIMEN: TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: Two of the five sub-species of Laterallus jamaicensis breed in North America, and include L. j. coturniculus and L. j. jamaicensis. DESCRIPTION: Smallest North American rail, sparrow-sized, total adult length 10 - 15 cm (3. 94 - 5. 91 in); mean mass 29 g. Adult generally shades of pale to blackish <b>gray.</b> <b>Top</b> of head darker than surrounding plumage (more evident in females); bill short and black. Underparts from chin to abdomen uniformly colored but lighter on chin and throat. Undertail coverts and flanks streaked with white and dark gray, washed with chestnut. Nape and upper back chestnut. Remainder of dorsum-back, uppertail coverts, and remiges- shades of dark gray, sometimes washed with chestnut or brown with scattered white spots. Spotting extends to wing coverts and secondaries, although much individual variation in amount of spotting. Rectrices brownish gray. Irises of adult shades of bright red, differing from other North American rails. Tarsi and toes grayish brown. Sexually dimorphic in plumage, but sexes similar in size (Eddleman et al 1994). Juveniles similar to adult, but juvenile plumage duller and white spots on back and wings fewer and smaller, white streaks on flanks thinner and less distinct. AIDS TO IDENTIFICATION: Easily distinguished from similar species in hand and at close range. In flight, might be confused with Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) or Sora (Porzana carolina), {{both of which have}} short bills for rails, but substantially smaller and darker than both and lacks white wing patches of Yellow Rail (Eddleman et al 1994) ...|$|E
