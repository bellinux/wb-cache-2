40|$|Recording {{and real}} time {{reconstruction}} of digital <b>hologram</b> sequences have recently become feasible. The {{amount of information}} that such <b>hologram</b> sequences contain results in voluminous data files, rendering their storage and transmission impractical. As a result, compression of digital <b>hologram</b> sequences is of utmost importance for practical applications of <b>hologram</b> sequences. In {{the absence of a}} specific <b>hologram</b> sequence compression technique, a first concern is how a high-performance conventional video compression technique would perform. Such a technique would not be optimized for <b>hologram</b> sequences but would provide a threshold that all <b>hologram</b> sequence compression techniques should reach. In this paper, the use of MPEG- 4 part 2 video coding algorithm for the compression of <b>hologram</b> sequences is investigated. Although the algorithm was originally developed for the compression of ordinary video, we apply it on digital <b>hologram</b> sequences and investigate its performance. For this, appropriate digital <b>hologram</b> sequences are used to asses how the coding algorithm affects their information content. In addition, we investigate whether MPEG- 4 interframe coding, which aims to achieve compression by exploiting similarities across adjacent frames of the sequence, offers any advantage compared to intraframe coding, where each frame is coded independently. Results show that the MPEG- 4 coding algorithm can successfully compress <b>hologram</b> sequences to compression rates of ∼ 20 : 1 while retaining the reconstruction quality of the <b>hologram</b> sequences...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} has demonstrated that with error diffusion, a complex Fresnel <b>hologram</b> can be converted into a phase-only <b>hologram,</b> and capable of preserving high fidelity on its reconstructed image. Furthermore, the phase-only <b>hologram</b> can be embedded with an image that is of {{the same size as the}} <b>hologram.</b> This is achieved by replacing the least M least significant bits (LSB) of each <b>hologram</b> pixel with the M most significant bits (MSB) of the embedded image in the error diffusion process. The phase-only <b>hologram</b> obtained in this manner is known as a Data Embedded Error Diffusion (DEED) <b>hologram.</b> Despite the success, the quality of the embedded image is rather poor for small value of M. However, if M is increased to preserve the quality of the embedded image, the phase-only <b>hologram</b> will be jeopardized. The DEED <b>hologram</b> also has no protection on the access of the embedded image, as it can be retrieved by simply extracting the M least significant bits of the <b>hologram</b> pixels. In this paper, a method for overcoming the above problems is reported. Briefly, the image to be embedded is first converted into an M bit data with the use of error diffusion. Next, a fixed window is reserved in the binary bit-string of each <b>hologram</b> pixel, within which M bits are randomly selected and replaced with the embedded image data. As such, the bit selection configuration in each <b>hologram</b> pixel can be taken as an encryption key for retrieving the embedded image. The image embedded phase-only <b>hologram</b> realized with such means, which is referred to as the Image Encrypted Error Diffusion (IEED) <b>hologram,</b> is capable of preserving high fidelity on the content of the <b>hologram,</b> as well as favorable visual quality on the embedded image if the correct encryption key is presented.

5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated <b>holograms</b> (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E
5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; <b>holograms</b> act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E
