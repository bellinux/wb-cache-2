The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E

5|$|The {{easiest way}} to produce {{intrinsic}} defects in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through irradiation with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The irradiation can occur in the laboratory or in the nature (see Diamond enhancement– Irradiation); it produces primary defects named frenkel defects (carbon atoms <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice vacancies. An important difference between the vacancies and interstitials in diamond is that whereas interstitials are mobile during the irradiation, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, however vacancies start migrating only at temperatures ~700°C.|$|E

The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> her feet by a wave while delivering her first line.

5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years out}} of the World Junior Championships, Martin had formed a new team and won his first provincial championship.

The rink was then off to the 1991 Canada Safeway World Curling Championships in Winnipeg. Martin turned the tables, going undefeated through the round robin. After beating Norway's Eigil Ramsfjell in the semifinal, Martin's team lost in the final, losing to Scotland's David Smith with a score of 2–7.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E

Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list. Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci.

5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado to touch down in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The tornado {{is known as the}} worst disaster in the history of Chappaqua.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was <b>knocked</b> <b>off</b> his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E
