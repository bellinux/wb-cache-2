50|$|Chrome plating is a {{finishing}} treatment using the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>deposition</b> of chromium. The {{most common form}} of chrome plating is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10-&#181;m layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000&#160;µm, are called hard chrome and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear.|$|E

50|$|As an {{original}} worker, Kundt was especially {{successful in the}} domains of sound and light. In 1866, he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes, {{based on the fact}} that a finely divided powder, lycopodium for example, when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air, tends to collect in heaps at the nodes, the distance between which can thus be ascertained. An extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases. This experimental apparatus is called a Kundt's Tube. In 1876 at Strasbourg in collaboration with Emil Warburg, Kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture involves an <b>electrolytic</b> copper <b>deposition</b> stage for consolidation of conductive circuit paths. Miniaturisation trends requiring increased circuit densities and high aspect ratio through-holes are restricted by the phenomenon of non-uniform copper electrodeposit thickness which can affect electrical impedance properties of the circuitry, cause electrical discontinuity between adjoining circuit layers and inhibit component-lead insertion. This thesis considers means of enhancing the electrodeposition process to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Following {{a comprehensive review of}} process technology, both a novel electrolyte agitation method utilising eductors and a Periodic Pulse Reverse (PPR) current technique were investigated experimentally within a pilot tank containing 350 litres of electrolyte. Eductor agitation was analysed/optimised using high-speed photography and a mass transport mapping technique. Data for agitation configurations were verified by statistical analysis of thickness distributions across high surface-area panels. PPR current was initially studied with a small-scale pulse unit and Assaf Cell throwing power test, followed by pilot tank trials using a full-size pulse rectifier in conjunction with eductor agitation and a proprietary electrolyte containing additives. Through-hole throwing power, deposit morphology and microstructure were investigated under various low-frequency pulse conditions and anodic-to-cathodic current density ratios. Eductor agitation and PPR current were compared against the more widely used air agitation and direct current techniques. The effects of air agitation on electrolyte conductivity and commercially produced PCBs were also considered. Optimum agitation conditions were achieved using eight eductors inclined at 37. 5 ° from the horizontal and spaced equidistantly along longitudinal tank walls. Such conditions decreased the standard deviation of copper thickness measured on high surface area panels and lessened edge-effects. Consistent agitation levels up to ten times greater than static solution were recorded, providing enhanced deposition rates; by comparison, air agitation achieved levels of around seven times in uniform regions.
