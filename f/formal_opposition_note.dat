25|$|The Labour, Green, New Zealand First and Mana {{parties are}} all in opposition, but only the Labour Party {{constitutes}} the <b>formal</b> <b>Opposition.</b>|$|R
50|$|The party's first leader, Thomas Greenway, {{does not}} appear to have faced any <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> when he created the party in 1882/1883.|$|R
50|$|Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 2012. She faced no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> in the Democratic primary. She had previously served in this district from 2007-2009.|$|R
50|$|Note: On many {{of these}} elections, the source did not have {{detailed}} information. Several individuals reported here as being elected by 100% {{may have had a}} few votes against them, but all had no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{a lengthy}} letter of resignation, Trotsky {{explicitly}} denied that [...] "Lessons of October" [...] {{had been published}} furtively or that it represented a [...] "platform" [...] for a <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> faction, as his detractors contended: ...|$|R
50|$|Notably for {{the first}} time in the assembly's history, parties {{entitled}} to seats on the executive could instead opt to go into <b>formal</b> <b>opposition.</b> The UUP, SDLP and Alliance all took up this option, leaving the DUP and Sinn Féin to form a government.|$|R
50|$|The {{passage of}} {{legislation}} {{and the government}} is dependent on retaining the confidence of the legislature. However, due to the absence of political parties there is no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> and instead of party caucuses members regularly participate in a caucus of all members of the legislature.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2006, Bale {{claimed that}} the Fiji Labour Party {{had no right to}} call itself the {{opposition}} and appoint shadow ministers. Bale said [...] "as far as the Opposition goes there are only two <b>formal</b> <b>Opposition</b> members {{while the rest of the}} FLP members are government back-benchers." ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{submission}} {{of the construction}} request in 1972 numerous <b>formal</b> <b>oppositions</b> were presented by groups and individuals at federal, cantonal, and communal level. All were rejected and construction started in 1973. In the meantime the oil crisis and the resulting {{awareness of the need}} of an energy mix diversification decreased the resistance to nuclear power.|$|R
2500|$|Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) President John J. Tuohy {{announced}} plans for the plant on April 13, 1965 during a stockholder's meeting. The plant {{was to be the}} first commercial nuclear power plant on Long Island and initially had little <b>formal</b> <b>opposition,</b> as Brookhaven already had multiple research nuclear reactors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, about [...] south of Shoreham.|$|R
50|$|The Labour Party and the Progressive Party, {{backed by}} New Zealand First and United Future, {{established}} a majority {{at the beginning}} the 48th Parliament. The Labour-led administration was in its third term. The National Party and ACT form the <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> to the government. Other non-government parties are the Greens (who promised to abstain on confidence and supply votes) and the Māori Party.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, Ferguson {{challenged}} six-term incumbent George W. Della, Jr. for the Democratic {{nomination for}} the 46th {{district in the}} Maryland Senate. He won the primary election {{by a margin of}} 59-41%. Running in a heavily Democratic district, he won the general election with no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition,</b> receiving 98% of the vote. He is the youngest state senator ever elected in Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{argued that}} the measure is {{antagonistic}} toward immigrants in transition, redundant in that English was already the “official and legal language” of Tennessee, and that passage of the measure could damage Nashville’s reputation as a welcoming city, its international economy, its budget, and its safety. [...] The most <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> came from Nashville for All of Us, a coalition of Nashville groups.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, {{government}} ministers Massat and Patrick Nisira {{resigned from}} the party to sit as independents in protest at a motion by their colleagues {{for the establishment of}} a <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> in Bougainville. The party endorsed Raymond Hakena, a former member of 1980s band Sanguma, in the 2008 presidential by-election after Kabui's death, but lost to James Tanis. Momis returned as leader of the party in August 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} was originally {{named for its}} founder, Landis Clark, who incorporated the town in June 2000 and served as its first mayor. In exchange for renaming the town to DISH, all residents received free basic television service for ten years and a free digital video recorder from Dish Network. There was no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> to renaming Clark; twelve citizens attended the council meeting to support the measure.|$|R
50|$|There {{tends to}} be an {{agreement}} dividing up the 14 posts between the groups, and thus they are usually elected without <b>formal</b> <b>opposition.</b> However, in 2009 Edward McMillan-Scott, through the individual support of 40 MEPs, successfully challenged his group's (the European Conservatives and Reformists) formal candidate; Michał Kamiński. Having been elected and prevented the election of Kaminski, McMillan-Scott was expelled from the ECR and Kaminski gained the group chair.|$|R
50|$|As {{there are}} no {{political}} parties, there is no <b>formal</b> parliamentary <b>Opposition,</b> though there are MPs who oppose the government.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{previous}} result {{the changes were}} that Labour party candidates gained two Conservative-held seats and a Liberal Democrat took a Labour councillor-held seat. [...] As shown in the 2012 table this meant the total of councillors stood as 31, 4 and 4 for these party groups, the governing group being that of Labour councillors. This election saw three seats in that group convert to the now largest <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> group of councillors, local Conservatives.|$|R
50|$|The Faculty and the Institute continues, in {{line with}} the {{majority}} vote, to continue to work up proposals for merger. However, a <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> group, FIDELIS — The Actuarial Defence Group (http://www.fidelisdefence.com), was formed in November 2008 by several members including Past Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the two bodies to oppose the merger. A formal vote on the combined merger, name change and new charter was held on 23 July 2009, when the Faculty vote passed the required threshold but the Institute vote failed.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to reconstruct the process {{that led to the}} <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> between the patterns used for expressing possessive and attributive relationships in the Coptic language (Sahidic dialect). Having explained this opposition on a synchronic level, the following questions should be answered: What {{is the source of the}} formal likeness; How did this system develop, and what were the syntactic and semantic preconditions for such a grammaticalization? Having identified the common source, an additional question arises: How come the two constructions still differ, and do not show a complete formal identity...|$|R
50|$|President Roosevelt was the popular, wartime {{incumbent}} {{and faced}} little <b>formal</b> <b>opposition.</b> Although many Southern Democrats mistrusted Roosevelt's racial policies, he brought enormous war activities {{to the region}} and the end of its marginal status was in sight. No major figure opposed Roosevelt publicly, and he was re-nominated easily when the Democratic Convention met in Chicago. Some pro-segregationist delegates tried to unite behind Virginia senator Harry F. Byrd, but he refused to campaign actively against Roosevelt, and did not get enough delegates to seriously threaten the President's chances.|$|R
50|$|When Ballance led the Liberals into {{government}} in 1891, they faced no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> in a party sense, though certain MPs were styled Leader of the Opposition. However, their opponents gradually coalesced around a leader, William Massey, who became Opposition leader in 1903, and in 1909 {{became the first}} leader of the new Reform Party. After this, the Leader of the Opposition would always be the parliamentary leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives that had not undertaken to support the Government of the day.|$|R
5000|$|Former B.C. cabinet {{minister}} Dr. Patrick McGeer, a research neuroscientist and a science advocate, has repeatedly advanced the proposal in recent decades. In a CKNW news item broadcast in August 2008, McGeer {{said he thinks}} the idea just needs [...] "a visionary politician" [...] to support it. McGeer still has the conceptual model of the bridge that was displayed at Expo 86. The idea has <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> {{in the form of}} an Islands Trust policy banning the building of any bridges or tunnels connecting the Gulf Islands to the Mainland or Vancouver Island.|$|R
5000|$|Little more {{is heard}} of Hatton until 1674, {{when he was}} elected Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire in the Cavalier Parliament. He entered Parliament at a time of acute {{political}} conflict, when a <b>formal</b> <b>Opposition</b> was emerging, arguably for the first time. Hatton, with his dubious reputation for loyalty to the Crown, achieved little distinction as an MP: he was described as being [...] "equally vile" [...] {{in the eyes of the}} Court and the Opposition. Hatton died in 1682 and was buried at Long Stanton on 19 April 1682.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 February 2007 the MK News {{newspaper}} {{reported that the}} V10 diversion plan had been withdrawn. The Citizen confirmed this the following day. English Partnerships have reportedly stated that they respect {{the importance of the}} grid system to the population of Milton Keynes. However, then Council Leader Isobel McCall stated at the time that she continued to support the [...] "City Street" [...] concept, saying that there was no <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> to the concept when first proposed (without saying when any opportunity to do so ever arose).|$|R
5000|$|During Asquith's {{coalition}} government of 1915-1916, {{there was no}} <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by John Redmond. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. Sir Edward Carson, the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{election}} and selection of a Prime Minister he accepted {{a position in the}} new Cabinet, as Minister for Health. On 13 January, however, he resigned from Cabinet, in protest against the inclusion in Cabinet of members from outside Parliament (to positions which he stated could have been entrusted to members of his party), and also to express his refusal to sign an agreement which would have prevented him from voting (in Parliament) against measures endorsed by Cabinet, based on the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility. Although there is no <b>formal</b> <b>Opposition,</b> Pōhiva was, from then on, considered the de facto opposition leader.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>formal,</b> legal <b>opposition,</b> many disputed appointments were occasions for popular demonstrations of discontent, sometimes linked to political demands for more democracy. Presbyteries were empowered {{to call in}} the army to impose a disputed appointment.|$|R
50|$|Bolivia's {{negotiating}} team, led by Pablo Solón, was {{a leading}} critic of the United States-sponsored Copenhagen Accord in the 2009 UNFCCC negotiations in Copenhagen, Denmark. Shortly thereafter, the Bolivian government issued a call for a World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, {{to be held in}} April 2010. The five-day summit, held in Tiquipaya on the outskirts of Cochabamba, issued its own People's Agreement as an agenda for international response to climate change. The Bolivian delegation to global climate talks worked to have this document and its demands included in international negotiations, but was isolated in its <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> to the conclusions of December Cancún climate summit.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the pact}} became a power-sharing {{agreement}} between the two main political parties (Copei and AD). Citizens, intellectuals, journalists, and the media started to demand reform of the whole political system to fit a growing democratic society. More <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> emerged in the late 1980s. One of the first indicators of public unrest was on February 27, 1989 where there were riots due {{to an increase in}} the prices of public transportation and gas. The 1993 presidential elections brought the first break from the pact; the former leader of COPEI, Rafael Caldera, was elected president under a different party, Convergencia. These events signified rising public dissatisfaction with the political system that the Pact of Puntofijo had created.|$|R
5000|$|The Assakenoi fielded 2,000 cavalry, 30 {{elephants}} and 30,000 infantry against Alexander {{during his campaign}} in India, which began in 327 BCE, but they eventually had to surrender after losses at places such as Beira, Massaga and Ora. The Aspasioi chose to flee into the hills but destroyed their city of Arigaion before doing so; 40,000 of them were captured, along with 230,000 oxen. Diodorus recorded {{the strength of the}} Aśvaka <b>opposition,</b> <b>noting</b> that the women took up arms along with the men, preferring [...] "a glorious death to a life of dishonour".|$|R
40|$|International audienceExpressing indefiniteness in adnumeral form in Polish and Latvian Summary When a {{substantive}} of the human-masculine gender stands in subject position in adnumeral plural there exist in Polish two different constructions if the quantifier {{is one of}} the "weak" numerals DWA "two", TRZY "three" or CZTERY "four". A similar phenomenon can be observed in Latvian with "strong" numerals (i. e. numerals expressing a definite quantity from DESMIT "ten" and up, or expressing an indefinite quantity). French slavist Étienne Decaux pointed out that this <b>formal</b> <b>opposition</b> may be used in Polish to express definiteness/indefiniteness of a nominal group. Likewise there exists in Latvian a tendency to express indefiniteness through a construction in which the quantified nominal appears in the form homonymic with the genitive...|$|R
50|$|Incumbent Representative John J. Flynt in his {{previous}} nine runs had never faced any serious challenge, winning re-election in 1972 without any <b>formal</b> <b>opposition.</b> However, in 1974, he was nearly defeated by political newcomer Newt Gingrich. This came as a considerable surprise. Flynt was {{known as one of}} the most conservative Democrats in the House, and 1974 was a very poor year for Republicans nationally due to fallout from Watergate. Gingrich would face Flynt in another close race in 1976, but come short again. Flynt would retire in 1978 rather than fight another close match (and possibly unsuccessful re-election bid) with Gingrich, thus finally giving Republicans a victory in a district that had not elected a Republican to the House of Representatives since Reconstruction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{confrontation}} revived {{in summer}} 1977. Over the Pentecost weekend around 3000 opponents a day participated to a protest march towards the plant construction site. On [...] 2000-3000 activists tried {{to occupy the}} accesses to the KKG {{and had to be}} dispersed by the police. The same scuffles took place two weeks later between 6000 demonstrators and 1000 policemen. Still the plant got the authorization to start operation in 1979. The continual strong opposition to the KKG induced the federal authorities in 1980 to call a hearing about the plant safety. They concluded that the plant satisfied all legal requirements and could continue operation. In April 1981 the last <b>formal</b> <b>oppositions</b> were rejected by the Federal Council, putting an end to a decade of intense confrontation.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Addison was not {{a member}} of the wartime {{coalition}} government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a <b>formal,</b> procedural <b>opposition</b> leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.|$|R
