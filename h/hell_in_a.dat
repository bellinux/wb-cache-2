The feud between the two continued and at the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell PPV, Punk lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell match.

5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E

On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in the <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E

The following pay-per-view event, Bragging Rights, was themed with interpromotional matches and now that The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw he was booked against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, his erstwhile tag team partner John Morrison. In the buildup to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of the}} Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner surviving with Sheamus and Drew Mcintyre.|$|E

At SummerSlam, Cena lost the championship to Brock Lesnar in a squash match, during which Lesnar hit Cena with sixteen suplexes and two F-5s, ending his reign at 49 days. Cena invoked his title rematch clause against Lesnar for Night of Champions, nearly winning before Seth Rollins attacked him to cause a disqualification, although he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events. Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell, but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Cena would instead face Randy Orton in a <b>Hell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Cell match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.|$|E
