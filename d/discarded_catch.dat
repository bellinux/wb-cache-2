The reconstructed total catch of 8. 5 million t from 1950 - 2010 was approximately 63 % higher than the baseline reported ICES landings of 5. 2 million t.

40|$|Light fishing has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, fishing with lamp (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, lift net, purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of light fishing technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of light fishing has been limited especially for purse seine and lift net (bagan). Bagan is a lift net formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on light fishing in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and lift net. These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and <b>discarded</b> <b>catch.</b> The other fishing gear, lift net of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for fish lamp. According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of <b>discarded</b> <b>catch.</b> It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly light fishing technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of lift net (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|E
40|$|High-grading is the {{decision}} by fishers to discard fish of low value {{that allows them to}} land more valuable fish. A literature review showed high-grading is reported in commercial and non-commercial fisheries around the world, although the number of observations is small. High-grading occurs in fisheries that are restricted to land their total catch due to management, market or physical constraints. Using the mixed flatfish fishery as a model system, a dynamic state variable model simulation showed that high-grading of certain grades occurs throughout the year when their ex-vessel price is low. High-grading increases with the degree of quota restriction, while the level of over-quota discarding is unrelated to the quota level. The size composition of the high-graded catch differs from the landed catch. Due to the differences in the seasonal variation in size specific ex-vessel price, the effect of quota restrictions on the size composition of the <b>discarded</b> <b>catch</b> is non-linear. High-grading is difficult to detect for the fishery inspection as it occurs on-board during the short period when the catch is processed.

The number of trips sampled by the Spanish program was distributed by three trawl fleets: Baca otter trawl, Pair trawl and HVO trawl.

A total of 91 fish and cephalopod species were recorded in the catches, of which 20 species were always retained, 40 were always discarded and the remaining 31 were selected depending on size (only larger specimens were retained). The most abundant species in the retained catch were Spicara smaris, Atherina hepsetus and Mullus barbatus, while Chromis chromis, Symphodus ocellatus and small specimens of Boops boops dominated the discards.

Since the minimum landing size (MLS) is regulated for only 4 out of the 15 most important species in this study, and even these regulations are only partially followed, discarding practices were generally market-driven.

Pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries contributed about 64 and 36 % of discards, respectively. Other gear types composed < 1 % of discards. Discards in tuna fisheries are now 63 % lower than estimated 1 decade earlier, mainly due to large declines in discards in longline tuna fisheries, possibly from increased retention of formerly discarded species and sizes of catch and increased gear selectivity. The decline also resulted, in part, from employing different methods to categorize caught sharks whose fins were retained and carcasses discarded following processing. Discard rates were greater in shallow-than deep-set longline fisheries, and higher in purse seine sets associated with fish aggregating devices and other floating objects than in other purse seine set types. The quality and availability of data on discards in global tuna fisheries were extremely limited.

From late 1995 to early 1999 EDCP observers collected discard data from 235 fishing trips by 25 trawl vessels that voluntarily participated in the program. Besides these observer data, vessels in the program kept enhanced logbooks that recorded retained and <b>discarded</b> <b>catch.</b> These logbooks had data from 866 trips by 44 vessels, including most of the trips with observers. Provided logbook data are acceptably accurate, collecting discard data using logbooks could be a cost-effective supplement to an observer program for measuring discard rates and total discards. Comparisons of tow-by-tow logbook discards with the corresponding observer discards indicated substantial inaccuracies in the logbook information. However, when averaged across tows, trips, and vessels, the discard rates (discard/catch) from the logbooks were lower than the observer discard rates, but predictably so. Generalized linear models {{were used to determine}} the major factors contributing to variability in the discard rates. The models indicated tremendous vessel-to-vessel variability in discard rates.

In each area, five species constituted the majority of the marketable catch (> 97 %) : sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), bogue (Boops boops) (in both areas), mackerel (Scomber japonicus; in the Aegean Sea) and picarel (Spicara smaris; in the Ionian Sea). Discarded quantities were on average 4. 6 % and 2. 2 % of the total catch in terms of weight in the Aegean and Ionian Seas respectively. Discards on the marketable ratio fluctuated over years and seasons without showing any particular trend. At the species level, sardine and mackerel were seldom discarded while large amounts of anchovy were discarded only during its recruitment period (autumn), when juvenile fish dominate the population. The discarding ratio for bogue, picarel and round sardinella ranged from zero to total discarding because they constitute a supplementary source of income for the fishers. Discarded fish comprised mainly small individuals for all species considered with the exception of round sardinella. However, the lengths at which 50 % of the individuals were discarded were generally small, often smaller than the species minimum landing sizes. Geographical coordinates and marketable catch explained part of the variability of the discarded quantities, as revealed by generalized additive models. Discarding practices and implications for management of purse seine fisheries are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many {{commercial}} fisheries seek to maximise the economic {{value of the}} catch that they bring ashore and market for human consumption by discarding undersize or low value fish. Information on the quantity, size and species composition of discarded fish is vital for stock assessments and for devising legislation to minimise the practice. However, {{except for a few}} major species, data are usually extremely sparse and reliant on observers aboard a small sample of fishing vessels. Expanding these data to estimate total regional discards is highly problematic. Here, we develop a method for utilising additional information from sci-entific trawl surveys to model the quantities of fish discarded by the {{commercial fisheries}}. As a case-study, we apply the model to the North Sea over the period 1978 - 2011, and show a long-term decline in the overall quantity of fish discarded, but an increase in the proportion of catch which is thrown away. The composition of <b>discarded</b> <b>catch</b> has shifted from pre-dominantly (* 80 %) roundfish, to> 50 % flatfish. Undersized plaice constitute the largest single fraction of discards, unchanged {{from the beginning of the}} 20 th century.

The analysis shows that much more information can be gained on discarding by utilising additional sources of data rather than relying solely on in-formation gathered by observers. In addition, it is clear that reducing fishing intensity and re-building stocks is likely to be more effective at reducing discards in the long term, than any technical legislation to outlaw the practice in the short term...|$|E

Overall, the equipment performed well, recording data for 99. 2 % of the time vessels were at sea.

EM image reviewers were also able to reliably detect hooks deployed and retained catch. About 40 % of the <b>discard</b> <b>catch</b> was not detected by EM image reviewers, because discard releases occurred outside the camera view.

In particular, the peri-mortem condition of a fish plays an integral role in {{the condition of the}} tissues post-mortem and hence in product quality, with harvesting techniques that result in stress or fatigue yielding a lower quality product. An understanding of the physiology of the target species and its response to harvest is therefore essential to implementing targeted improvements in harvesting technologies. For species harvested using trawl-based technologies, this includes knowledge of their exercise physiology, in particular their swimming capacity, since this is a key determinant of the interaction between fish and trawl gears, and hence of the nature and severity of stress experienced and of the condition of fish at landing. This thesis describes a series of discrete studies relating to the exercise physiology of juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, an iconic New Zealand finfish that comprises important recreational and commercial fisheries. In particular, we sought to characterise the capacity of snapper for sustained swimming activity, including how performance may differ between fish of different size or with environmental temperature; to determine the consequences of exhaustive exercise for both subsequent swimming activity, an important determinant of survival in escaping or <b>discarded</b> <b>catch,</b> and for tissue biochemistry, which ultimately determines product quality in harvested fish; to validate the use of laboratory-based simulations for the study of capture-related stress by comparing the response of laboratory-exercised snapper with commercially caught fish; and to determine the tolerance of snapper to environmental hypoxia, and further, the possible consequences of hypoxia for swimming capacity and for recovery in fish retained for subsequent rested-type harvest. The capacity of snapper for sustained swimming activity was characterised through the use of incremental exercise tests to determine critical swimming speeds, Ucrit. Juvenile snapper (94 - 107 mm length, 16 - 157 g mass) demonstrated a strong swimming capacity, with individual fish attaining critical swimming speeds of up to 7. 1 body lengths per second (bl s⁻¹). Swimming performance demonstrated an allometric association, with absolute critical speeds increasing with fish size, whilst relative performance favoured smaller fish. The relation was described by the function Ucrit (m s⁻¹) = 0. 003412 [length (mm) ] + 0. 2669. Critical swimming performance also exhibited variation in response to environmental variables. Thermal performance curves were evident in snapper acclimated to 12, 18 and 24 °C, with the suggestion of optimal performance at acclimation temperatures between 18 and 24 °C. Critical swimming performance was also significantly reduced during exposure to ambient oxygen tensions below 80 mmHg; at 40 mmHg, snapper attained only 21 % of the critical swimming speeds observed under normoxic (150 mmHg) conditions. In juvenile snapper (~ 75 g), exhaustive exercise resulted in severe metabolic, acid-base, haematological and hormonal perturbations, the nature of which were similar to those classically demonstrated in other strong-swimming fish species, especially salmonids. These included the depletion of glycogen from within the white muscle (WM) and the concomitant production of lactate, with a resultant lactacidosis of the plasma; recruitment of erythrocytes from the spleen; and the release of cortisol to the plasma. The recovery of these disturbances required 6 hours under laboratory conditions. As the stresses experienced by fish during commercial capture are often considered to be greater than those which can be induced during laboratory-based simulations, it was necessary to investigate whether the magnitude of the perturbations observed in laboratory-exercised snapper were an appropriate model of those of trawl-caught fish. In trawl-caught snapper (1100 g, 38 cm) obtained under commercially-relevant conditions (tow speed ~ 3. 0 knots; duration 2. 25 - 2. 75 hours), the magnitude of the perturbations were greater than for laboratory-exercised fish. While the recovery of some metabolites was evident within the first 18 hours post-capture, their recovery was prolonged relative to laboratory-exercised fish; other metabolites, namely muscle glycogen and plasma cortisol, exhibited no signs of recovery. These observations suggest that the response of snapper to exhaustive exercise within the laboratory may underestimate the severity of the response induced by commercial harvest. This is further suggested by post-capture mortality rates of 14 %, whereas no mortality was observed following fatigue at Ucrit. Exhaustive exercise also resulted in the impairment of subsequent critical swimming performance. Immediately following fatigue, snapper (85 - 160 g) were capable of sustained swimming activity at speeds of up to 60 - 70 % Ucrit; however, critical swimming performance was reduced 30 %, presumably due to limitations in WM function. There was no suggestion of the recovery of WM function within the first 30 minutes post-fatigue; thereafter, Ucrit was progressively restored, such that snapper were able to repeat their initial swimming performance in a second Ucrit test performed 2 hours after the conclusion of the first. Snapper were moderately tolerant of hypoxia, oxygen-regulating at reduced oxygen tensions (< 100 mmHg) by virtue of increased ventilatory rate and stroke volume, with a distinct bradycardia developing at PO₂ below 60 mmHg. Larger snapper appeared to possess a greater hypoxia tolerance than did smaller fish, with Pcrit resolved to 77 in 20 g fish, and 50 mmHg in 150 and 230 g fish. Exposure to moderate hypoxia (60 - 80 mmHg) during recovery from an exhaustive exercise event constrained MO₂ max to 78 % of that of normoxic fish, however did not appear to impede the return of MO₂ to routine levels. The present study is the first to examine in detail the swimming performance of snapper, and the consequences of exhaustive exercise for physiological condition. By understanding the swimming capacities of snapper, {{it may be possible to}} refine harvesting practices (i. e. tow speeds) or utilise technologies (i. e. net design) such that the water velocities through the trawl net are within the range at which the fish can swim sustainably, minimising the extent of stress and fatigue experienced by fish, and hence their effects on both quality and survival. The study also demonstrates that whilst snapper experience significant physiological disturbance during commercial harvesting, including significant mortality, some fish demonstrate the potential for metabolic recovery, which may permit their retention in an on-board tank facility for subsequent rested-type harvest. Finally, the present work highlights a number gaps in our understanding of the link between harvesting conditions and fish condition, and makes a number of suggestions for future studies or directions...|$|E
40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from Nephrops trawling in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of Øresund to towed gears since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of towed gears in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal towed gears in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod trawl fishery and Nephrops trawl fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of towed gears may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the trawl door distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the Nephrops trawl fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase – reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of semi-pelagic trawl doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of Rapa whelk and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of <b>discarded</b> <b>catch</b> in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|E
