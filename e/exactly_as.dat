5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E

Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E

This printing was available as two slip case sets, with Dragons of Despair included in Dragonlance Volume 1: DL1 – DL8. The four chapters of Dragons of Autumn, an updated version of some Dragonlance modules converting them to Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5, corresponds to the material in Dragons of Despair.|$|E

5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E
5|$|Washed {{up and out}} of {{the public}} eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his {{influence}} to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise that it will be built <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

5|$|As Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165km/h, (105mph) were reported, with {{extensive}} damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$84,000 (63,000 USD 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E
5|$|In Garrard's November 5, 1798, State of the Commonwealth address, he {{encouraged}} the General Assembly to declare its {{views on the}} Alien and Sedition Acts. Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three-person committee {{to carry out the}} governor's charge. The resolutions that the committee brought to the floor on November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions. The first seven were <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> Jefferson had written them, but Breckinridge modified the last two, eliminating Jefferson's suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts. During the debate on the House floor, Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them. Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate. Upon concurrence of both houses, Garrard signed the resolutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only then did Allied pilots learn {{how to deal with}} their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal without the benefit of test reports would beg to differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression of the airplane is <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E
5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.|$|E
