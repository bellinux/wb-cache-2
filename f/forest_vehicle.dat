The three main objectives are the minimization of number of routes, the minimization of total distance and the minimization of total time by respecting the specified time window and the demand of all customers, which are sometimes important in this field.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive numerical {{study of the}} crashworthy design of a rain <b>forest</b> <b>vehicle</b> (RFV) subjected to impact loading. A commercial finite element (FE) nonlinear code, LSDYNA, was employed to further evaluate the energy absorption performance of the structure under two crash scenarios; impacting a rigid wall and a rigid pole. The simulation results were used to identify the energy absorption capacity of the main subcomponent, thus facilitating crashworthiness requirements for future design improvements. The aims of this investigation were to enhance understanding of RFV behavior under impact loading and improve energy absorption capacity and safety, which will contribute towards {{the development of an}} early design stage of the RFV, and design and evaluation that may lessen the need for destructive full-scale testing. Recommendations and suggestions for improving the energy absorption capacity of RFVs have been made. A considerable improvement in energy absorption capacity has been obtained by inclusion of a supplementary device attached to the main chassis. These simplified provisions provide design guidelines that will considerably improve an operator's chances of survival during an accidental impact in the forest...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{research}} of resistance differences in winching of logs with their thicker or thinner end turned forward. Winching represents traction of wood assortments on the ground from the felling site to the <b>forest</b> <b>vehicle</b> equipped with a forest winch. The winching coefficient {{is determined by the}} horizontal tractive force and weight of the traction load. The research of resistance in winching wood assortments was carried out for the purpose of determining the size of the forest winch designed for equipping the prototype of the thinning tractor assembly (adapted farming tractor, forest semi-trailer and hydraulic crane) and developing an environmentally and economically viable technology for timber production. The research was carried out on flat forestland in a pedunculate oak stand by winching three logs of different weight. The research results have shown that the winching coefficients depend on the weight of logs, shape of log and their direction. Higher weight causes higher traction resistance. In all cases, the winching coefficients were higher in winching of logs with their thicker end turned forward. In order to achieve lower ground-based traction resistance and, at the same time, cause less damage to forest soil, winching of logs should be carried out with their thinner end turned forward...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using autonomous forest vehicles (which {{can be regarded}} as logical developments in the ongoing automation of forest machines), the systems that could be applied in them, their potential advantages and their limitations (in the foreseeable future) are considered here. The aims were to analyse: (1) the factors influencing the degree of automation in logging; (2) the technical principles that can be applied to autonomous forest machines, and (3) the {{feasibility of}} developing an autonomous path-tracking <b>forest</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A class of such vehicles that are believed to have considerable commercial potential is autonomous wood shuttles (forwarders). The degree of automation is influenced by increased productivity, the machine operator as a bottle-neck, cost reduction, and environmental aspects. Technical principles that can be applied to autonomous forest vehicles are satellite navigation, laser odometry, wheel odometry, laser scanner and radar. The presented system has demonstrated both possibilities and difficulties associated with autonomous forest machines. It is in a field study shown that it is quite possible for them to learn and track a path previously demonstrated by an operator with an accuracy of 0. 1 m on flat ground.

40|$|Hydrostatic {{transmission}} {{is used in}} many applications where high torque at low speed is demanded. For this project a <b>forest</b> <b>vehicle</b> is at focus. Komatsu Forest {{would like to have}} a model for the pressure in the hose between the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor. Pressure peaks can arise when the vehicle changes speed or hit a bump in the road, but if a good model is achieved some control action can be developed to reduce the pressure peaks. For simulation purposes a model has been developed in Matlab-Simulink. The aim has been to get the simulated values to agree as well as possible with the measured values of the pressure and also for the rotations of the pump and the motor. The greatest challenge has been due to the fact that the pressure is a sum of two flows, if one of these simulated flows is too big the pressure will tend to plus or minus infinity. Therefore it is necessary to develop models for the rotations of the pump and the motor that stabilize the simulated pressure. Different kinds of models and methods have been tested to achieve the present model. Physical modeling together with a black box model are used. The black box model is used to estimate the torque from the diesel engine. The probable torque from the ground has been calculated. With this setup the simulated and measured values for the pressure agrees well, but the fit for the rotations are not as good...|$|E

Airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust.

Experimental testing was conducted on subcomponents to validate the FE model and the analytical analyses from the previous researchers were conducted to compare the results.

The validated model was then used to examine three different crash scenarios; impacting rigid wall, 40 % offset and rigid pole. The simulation results were used to identify the load path, deceleration and the energy absorption capacity of the main longitudinal component and available crush zone, thus facilitating crashworthiness requirement for future design improvements.

40|$|Forests are {{of great}} {{importance}} to the peoples and economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico. Over {{the past two decades}} or so, forest values and practices have evolved to encompass economic, environmental, social and cultural considerations. As a result, sustainable forest management and/or ecosystem management have emerged in North America as a new paradigm. The meaning of the paradigm shift differs somewhat between the three countries. In Mexico, sustainable forestry has led to a stronger emphasis on rural development and equitable benefit distribution. In Canada and the US, a higher level of economic development has led to a more exclusive focus on the environment, and increases in wealth, education and life expectancy in these two countries have led to greater demands for a wide array of environmental services from forests. Significant changes have also taken place in forest policies and governance arrangements of the three countries. The reasons for this have been changing government priorities, the influence of forest interest groups, new knowledge about natural disturbances, climate change and dynamics at the forest landscape level, as well as the influence of global initiatives with respect to forest practices.
