40|$|Abstract: Product {{functional}} analysis {{is the foundation}} of product modularization. Before product module division, function-related analysis of every component or <b>function</b> unit is necessary. As for completely innovative products, the traditional methods are consistent with the habits of designers mind and can help product innovation, while {{it is difficult to determine}} the <b>function</b> decomposition granularity. The issue of <b>function</b> decomposition granularity determination challenges the same for mature products. To achieve the <b>function</b> decomposition of made-products, bottom-up <b>function</b> decomposition are proposed and researched. Firstly, determine the possible <b>function</b> unit (bottom <b>function)</b> list for mature products. Secondly, cluster the <b>function</b> units to get their parent <b>functions,</b> and then execute iterated clustering of parent <b>functions</b> until the parent <b>function</b> is product overall <b>function.</b> Finally, products <b>function</b> tree is obtained to achieve <b>function</b> decomposition. In the proposed methodology, the <b>function</b> hierarchy matrix and <b>function</b> incidence matrix are defined to describe the <b>function</b> and the <b>function</b> unit table is built based on which the <b>function</b> units of products are achieved. The relationship between <b>function</b> units achieved above is expressed by using the <b>function</b> hierarchy matrix and <b>function</b> incidence matrix. The <b>function</b> incidence matrix is operated to get the <b>function</b> tree and <b>function</b> decomposition based on bottom-up method by using-intercept.
