40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is an {{important}} component of the wetland <b>water</b> budget. <b>Water</b> <b>level</b> declines in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, have caused concerns, especially during <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> However, how wetland ET and its partitioning respond to abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> is unclear. In this study, wetland ET was estimated with MODIS data and meteorological data. The wetland ET partitioning and its relationship with abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> were analyzed for 2000 – 2013. The results showed that the water evaporation rate (Ewater) was larger than the land ET rate (ETland); the ETland/Ewater ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 99. When the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was below 12. 8 [*]m, the ET partition ratio was larger than 1, which indicates that wetland ET comes from land surface ET more than water evaporation. The negative standardized <b>water</b> <b>level</b> index (SWI) was used to represent an abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the wetland. Although the monthly wetland ET decreased as the negative SWI decreased, ETland was higher than the average under negative SWI conditions from September to December, when the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> decreased. The abnormally <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> induced more <b>water</b> loss from the land surface, especially when the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> decreased, which reduced the available water resources along the wetland shore...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{on the effect}} of different stress factors on Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758, is far from complete and therefore we decided to find out how the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> stress could effect pathophysiological parameters such as: plasma cortisol level, haemoglobin, haematocrit, chloride (Cl−), sodium (Na+), osmolality, lactate, and glucose in this fish; and how this stressor affects the gut morphology. Two hundred and four juvenile Atlantic salmon were randomly distributed into six fibreglass tanks and divided into two groups: group 1 (control) and group 2 (<b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> tress). The <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> stre did not affect growth performance and the pathophysiological parameters.

During this period the lake levels fell below mean sea level (approximately +0.2 m AHD) downstream of the barrages, reversing the usual positive hydraulic gradient from the lake to the sea.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{findings of}} an online survey of 1, 815 Great Lakes property owners, managers, and other interested stakeholders. The survey was administered between September and November 2014 following {{a period of}} extremely <b>low</b> Great Lakes <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in 2013 and the rapid rebound to average-above average <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in 2014. The purpose of the survey was to inform the University of Michigan Graham Sustainability Institute’s Integrated Assessment of <b>Water</b> <b>Levels</b> in the Great Lakes. The results of the survey indicate that property owners and managers surveyed are highly concerned about <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in the Great Lakes. Some key impacts that respondents have experienced include a decrease in recreational opportunities due to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> an increase in operating expenses due to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> a decrease in water quality due to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> and property damage due to erosion. The most popular forms of information for obtaining knowledge about <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> among respondents are personal contact with friends, family members, and neighbors, websites of organizations dealing with <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> news media, and email updates/alerts.
