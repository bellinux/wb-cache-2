5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move {{downwards}} faster than upwards. If there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> {{direction in which}} the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate for study.|$|E

5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E

25|$|So Newton's {{laws are}} exactly obeyed by the {{expected}} {{values of the}} operators in any given state.

25|$|The Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{does not}} {{directly}} apply to sets of infinitely many points or to geometries over finite fields: the set of all points in the plane or the set of all points in a finite geometry <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> example of a point set without any ordinary lines.|$|E

25|$|As {{described}} above, this hexagonal phase originates from a cubic phase, {{and thus}} one may expect a similar structural element in these phases. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> {{relation between the}} hexagonal ab-plane and the cubic (111) plane. Figures 31a and b show the hexagonal (001) and the cubic (111) planes, respectively. Both network structures are almost the same that allows intergrowth of the hexagonal phase in the cubic phase.|$|E
25|$|Henry (1977) {{alluded to}} Maclean's {{model of the}} {{tripartite}} brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older {{part of the brain}} and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that {{there was a time when}} emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.|$|E
25|$|An {{intensive}} era of whaling {{began when}} peace was established after the Valois marriage (1572). An average of fifteen ships {{was sent to}} Terranova each year, with twenty being sent during the peak years. Aguilar (1986), referring {{to the number of}} both Spanish and French Basque ships, said twenty-thirty galleons would seem fairly accurate. Thomas Cano (1611) said more than 200 ships were sent to Terranova, although this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> exaggeration.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with such}} realism, Purananuru shows glimpses of fantasy as well. The second poem by Mudinagarayar {{addresses}} the Chera king Uthayan Cheralaathan and praises {{him for his}} feeding the armies at the Kurukshetra war. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> anachronism suggesting a king of the early common era Tamil country had {{a role to play}} in a mythological battle of the Mahabharata epic. Based on this one poem, there have been attempts at dating the Purananuru poems to around 1000 BCE or older.|$|E
25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} an open window {{with his back to the}} audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E
25|$|Les bayadères is an {{important}} transitional work {{in the tradition of}} operas on Oriental themes. In the 18th-century, these tended to be set in the Middle East and were usually comic in spirit. Examples include Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Grétry's La caravane du Caire. As the 19th century progressed, French Oriental operas moved further eastwards, especially to South Asia, with works such as Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles and Delibes' Lakmé. These were generally more emotional than comic and Les bayadères, set in India and with a serious plot, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> forerunner.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{formulation}} of the cycle double cover conjecture asks whether every bridgeless undirected graph has a collection of cycles such that each edge of the graph is contained in exactly two of the cycles. The requirement that the graph be bridgeless <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> necessary condition for such a set of cycles to exist, because a bridge cannot belong to any cycle. A collection of cycles satisfying {{the condition of the}} cycle double cover conjecture is called a cycle double cover. Some graphs such as cycle graphs and bridgeless cactus graphs can only be covered by using the same cycle more than once, so this sort of duplication is allowed in a cycle double cover.|$|E
25|$|Little Langdale Tarn {{was several}} times larger {{at the end}} of the last ice age, the lost area having become filled with {{sediment}} and resulted in the flat farmland beside the current lake. The catchment area is a sheepfarm of rough grassland and sphagnum bog in the valley bottom and surrounding fellside. Sediment cores taken at the lake show a top layer of brown organic sediment followed by a grey coloured minerogenic layer rich in copper from the mining activities at Greenburn. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> increase in the sediment accumulation rate with time, the major source being peat pipes and sheep grazing close to Wrynose Beck, a tributary of the Brathay.|$|E
25|$|John Gay parodied {{the opera}} with his satirical Beggar's Opera (1728) and offered up {{a parody of}} Robert Walpole's actions during the South Sea Bubble. Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who keeps being imprisoned by a thief named Peachum and who escapes prison {{over and over again}} because the {{daughter}} of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is in love with him. That <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> parallel with the case of Jonathan Wild (Peachum) and Jack Sheppard (Macheath). However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath). The play was a hit, and its songs were printed up and sold. However, when Gay wrote a sequel called Polly, Walpole had the play suppressed before performance (Winn 112–114).|$|E
