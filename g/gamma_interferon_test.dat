40|$|Tuberculosis, {{known as}} the "White Plague" in the early 19 th century, is the {{infectious}} disease, which is being researched today even {{in some of the}} most developed countries in the world. Epidemiological- epizootiological research points to the importance of pasteurizing milk as well as the transmission in aerosolized droplets in humans and animals. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), M. bovis, M. africanum and M. microti are the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis. Other mycobacteria cause diseases commonly known as mycobacteriosae. Pathogenesis of tuberculosis includes both host- related and mycobacterium-related factors (virulence). Mtb acts through the expression of various genes and their proteins that are detectable in the serums of the diseased only, proving these proteins are formed in the course of the disease. In humans, a diagnosis is established by the detection of antigens (and antibodies), and in animals, with the allergy tests. As far as the bovine tuberculosis is concerned, the combination of skin tuberculin and blood <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> <b>test</b> is recommended.

Using the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> <b>test,</b> exposure to M. bovis was detected in 21. 6 % of the buffaloes. One dead buffalo and an emaciated warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) that was euthanased, were necropsied; both had miliary granulomas from which M. bovis was isolated. None of the buffaloes sampled in Sector A of the park, which has no cattle interface, tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (BTB) exposure. The prevalence and distribution of BTB {{does not appear to}} have changed significantly since the 1960 s, but this may be due to fluxes in the buffalo population. Serological testing for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) demonstrated positive exposure of 57. 1 % of the buffaloes sampled, with types A, O and SAT 1 - 3, which is the first known report of FMD antibodies to A and O types in free ranging African buffaloes.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{an important}} emerging disease in wildlife and a poorly studied zoonosis in Southern Africa. Introduced through livestock to the African buffalo population in the South of Kruger National Park (KNP), the pathogen has spread towards the unfenced northern boundary of KNP which coincides with the boundary with Zimbabwe. If most of KNP is fenced, the adjacent Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) in Zimbabwe is unfenced allowing contacts between wildlife and livestock. We investigated the risk of emergence of bTB in African buffalo and in communal cattle in and around GNP. In Zimbabwe, between 2008 and 2009, 48 buffalos and 120 cattle heads were tested for bTB. Weequippedwith GPS collars 12 buffalos in four herds and 12 cattle heads in 12 herds in {{the periphery of the}} GNP. We collected one year of GPS data. Four buffalos were positive to bTB with the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> <b>test.</b> Two of them were post-mortem and culture isolation of a KNP bTB strain was confirmed. No cattle were confirmed bTB positive. After constructing matrices of contacts between cattle and buffalo, we used network analysis to analyse these contacts for different temporal windows chosen on the basis of bTB modes of transmission. We report the emergence of bTB in GNP buffalo from KNP buffalo. Direct contact between buffalo and cattle were rare but few indirect contacts were compatible with bTB transmission.

40|$|The {{procedures}} for gaining, maintaining, suspending, withdrawing or re-gaining official bovine tuberculosis free herd status and for certification for intra-Union trade {{are based on}} the results of tuberculin skin tests. The skin test has a number of drawbacks, therefore the suitability of the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> <b>test</b> and other tests to be included by EU legislation was assessed. Suitability means that the test has a sensitivity equivalent or superior to the standard test currently used in the European Union and specificity not lower than that of the standard test with the lowest specificity used in the EU. Furthermore, there should be no foreseeable practical difficulties that could compromise test performance. It was concluded that purified protein derivative based gamma interferon tests can be included amongst the official tests for the purpose of demonstrating freedom. However, some results suggest that the specificity of the purified protein derivative based gamma interferon tests may not always be as high as the single intradermal tuberculin test. In case the test is included, the protocols for its use for this purpose should be harmonised in the EU. Based on the reviewed information, other tests should not yet be considered for inclusion in the official tests for the purpose of granting and retaining official tuberculosis free herd status. Further evaluation of the suitability of the gamma interferon tests test should study the influence of factors such as the presence of environmental mycobacteria, prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the herd, the age type and bovine tuberculosis test history of the animals all of which may affect test specificity and hence the suitability of the test for demonstrating freedom from bovine tuberculosis in different situations...|$|E

In this study, the efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for protection against bovine tuberculosis (bTB) was evaluated in Holstein calves under field conditions in Ethiopia. Thirteen neonatally vaccinated and 14 control calves were exposed for 10 to 23 months to skin <b>test</b> reactor cows. <b>Gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> (IFN-γ) <b>testing,</b> comparative intradermal tuberculin testing, postmortem examination, and bacteriological culture {{were used for the}} evaluation of BCG efficacy. The overall mean pathology score was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in control calves than in vaccinated calves. Culture positivity for Mycobacterium bovis was higher in the control calves than in the vaccinated calves, and significantly more BCG-vaccinated animals would have passed a standard meat inspection (P = 0. 021). Overall, the protective efficacy of BCG was between 56 % and 68 %, depending on the parameters selected. Moreover, by measuring <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> responses to the antigens ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10, which are present in M. bovis but absent from BCG, throughout the experiment, we were able to distinguish between vaccinated animals that were protected against bTB and those animals that were not protected.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} whether BCG vaccination, {{in addition to}} a reduction of active tuberculosis, leads to a reduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection during an outbreak of tuberculosis. METHODS: Pupils (n= 199) of a Junior School exposed to a pupil with active pulmonary tuberculosis were screened using a <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> release assay for detection of M. tuberculosis infection (ex vivo ELISPOT assay). Relative risk of M. tuberculosis infection and pulmonary tuberculosis associated with BCG vaccination were calculated and adjusted for exposure risk. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of children with previous BCG vaccination had a reactive <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> release assay compared with 47 % of unvaccinated children (unadjusted RR 0. 61, 95 %CI 0. 39, 0. 96). The protective effect of BCG vaccination persisted following adjustment for other risk factors for infection like ethnicity and proximity to the source case reflected in membership of class and activity groups (corrected relative risk 0. 26, 95 %CI 0. 09, 0. 69 and risk reduction of 74 %, 95 %CI 31 %, 91 %). A higher proportion of unvaccinated children (11 %) were diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with 5 % of vaccinated children (RR 0. 51 95 %CI 0. 15, 1. 70).

40|$|Rapid, simple, and {{accurate}} antemortem tests for tuberculosis (TB) in cattle {{need to be}} developed in order to augment the existing screening methods. In particular, as cattle vaccines are developed, such tests would allow the continuation of test-and-slaughter policies alongside vaccination. Therefore, the development of an assay that distinguishes infected from vaccinated animals (a DIVA test) is an urgent research requirement. In this study, we assessed the performance of a novel multiplex serological test with sera collected from 96 skin-tested animals with bovine tuberculosis, 93 TB-free animals, and 39 cattle vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Our results indicate that the test has a relative sensitivity range of 77. 0 % to 86. 5 % at corresponding specificity levels of 100. 0 % to 77. 6 %. Comparison with the Bovigam <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> antemortem <b>test</b> revealed that this serology test was significantly more sensitive at specificities above 97. 9 %, while the Bovigam test was, on average, about 10 % more sensitive when the test specificity was set below 97 %.

40|$|In December 2007, a tuberculosis-positive cow was {{identified}} when a TB lesion was discovered on a lymph node during routine slaughterhouse surveillance in California. To {{prevent the spread}} of TB, an epidemiological investigation was instigated and the case was traced back to a dairy herd in Fresno County. The affected herd was purchased by the federal government and depopulated, preventing California from losing its accredited-free status. However, on September 18, 2008, a second infected herd was discovered, and California's bovine TB status was downgraded from accredited-free to modified-accredited advanced, limiting trade and movement of cattle from the state. Bovine tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus bacteria caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Primarily known as a respiratory disease, M. bovis can infect many vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, deer, pigs, bison, buffalo, camelids, and humans). The disease is spread by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols, and ingestion of contaminated milk or feed. Clinical signs may be difficult to detect but include lethargy, emaciation, anorexia, a chronic intermittent moist cough, dyspnea or tachypnea, and a low-grade fluctuating fever. Since the 2007 case of bovine TB, 395, 000 cattle have been tested for TB within California. Diagnostic tests include the caudal fold tuberculin test (CFT), comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCT), <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> <b>test,</b> histopathology, PCR, DNA fingerprinting, culture, and necropsy. Today, a total of 8 cases have been confirmed, 2 herds depopulated, and over 8, 000 cattle killed. Although over $ 20 million has been spent on the California investigation, the source of TB infection remains unknown. TB has been an ongoing problem since the early 1900 s when it was {{the leading cause of death}} in the US. In 1917, the Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program was created as a test-and-slaughter program in the US. Today, 49 states are considered accredited-free.

The animals were tested in parallel, after stimulation with Australian tuberculins and tuberculins produced at our institute, by using the skin test and two IFN-γ assays. The results of this trial showed that the specificity of the IFN-γ test is higher than that of the skin test (96. 8 %) and ranges from 97. 3 % (using only Australian tuberculins) to 98. 6 % (using tuberculins produced at our institute).

Furthermore, the intensity and distribution of pathology of bovine tuberculosis were compared between the two breeds. Our data demonstrated significantly (all P 0. 05) between the two breeds.

Neutralization of IL- 10 by a monoclonal antibody resulted in increased levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPDj) -stimulated samples from both infected and exposed goats. However, the levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> release were also increased in unstimulated cells and in PPDj-stimulated cells from some noninfected animals following neutralization. Depletion of putative regulatory CD 25 high T cells had no clear effect on the number of gamma-interferon-producing cells. The IL- 10 -producing cells were identified to be mainly CD 14 + major histocompatibility complex class II-positive monocytes in both PPDj-stimulated and control cultures and not regulatory T cells. However, possible regulatory CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells produced IL- 10 in response to concanavalin A stimulation. The numbers of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 8 + γδT-cell receptor-positive cells producing <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> increased following IL- 10 neutralization. These results provide insight into the source and the role of IL- 10 in <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> assays with cells from goats and suggest that IL- 10 from monocytes can regulate both innate and adaptive <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production from several cell types. Although IL- 10 neutralization increased the sensitivity of the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> assay, the specificity of the test could be compromised...|$|R

Acesso restrito. p. 2066 - 2069 The {{lymphocytes}} {{from eight}} patients with active visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease associated with marked immunologic dysfunction, were examined for {{ability to produce}} interleukin 2 (IL- 2) and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> during in vitro cultivation. It was found that both IL- 2 and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production, in response to leishmania antigen, was absent during the active disease, but was restored after successful chemotherapy. Untreated VL patients produced IL- 2 and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Six patients with either active cutaneous or mucosal leishmaniasis, a disease not associated with immunosuppression, showed high levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> in response to leishmania antigen and PHA. Since IL- 2 and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> {{have been shown to}} have important roles in the immune response and in the killing of leishmania, their absence may represent a key defect in the immune response in VL...|$|R
40|$|Patients with fibrosing {{alveolitis}} have active inflammation {{within their}} lung interstitium. Previous {{studies have focused}} on the humoral (immune complex) driven processes. In this study increased pulmonary <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production has been evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells were obtained from 40 patients with fibrosing alveolitis, 22 with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, and 18 with connective tissue disease associated (CTD) fibrosing alveolitis. Increased <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production was seen in 12 (30 %) patients and was similar in the two study groups. Up to 512 units/ 10 (6) cells were released over 24 hours, showing that the amounts of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> released could be as large as those seen in other pulmonary diseases associated with active cellular immune processes, such as sarcoidosis. Spontaneous <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production was related to increased serum concentrations of IgG and IgM but not to serum IgA, antinuclear antibody, or rheumatoid factor titres. There was no relation between <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production and pulmonary uptake of gallium- 67 citrate. The ratio of helper-inducer (Leu- 3) to suppressor-cytotoxic (Leu- 2) cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was similar in the two study groups and was similar in patients whose cells produced <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> and those whose cells did not. These data suggest that <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is released in the lungs of a proportion of individuals with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and CTD-fibrosing alveolitis, suggesting a role for this cytokine in mediating these diseases...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of interferons on the {{induction}} of human monocyte secretion of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) activity by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Monocytes do not spontaneously produce IL- 1 {{and the addition of}} interferons to the culture does not lead to detectable secretion. Addition of LPS alone induces the release of measurable amounts of IL- 1 activity. The addition of low doses (1 - 10 units/ml) of alpha, beta, or <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> to the LPS-stimulated cultures further increases this secretion by 50 %. The addition of 1000 units/ml of alpha or beta interferon leads to inhibition of IL- 1 release. By contrast, <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is a dose dependent enhancer of IL- 1 release. The effect of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is on the production of IL- 1 and is not an enhancement of IL- 1 activity in the biological assay. Results demonstrate that addition of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> to monocytes increases the rate of secretion of IL- 1 by these cells. <b>Gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> also appears to abrogate the loss in the ability of monocytes to produce IL- 1 activity after overnight culture. This last result parallels the maintainence of the expression of the HLA-DR surface marker on monocytes by <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon.</b> These results may help define a mechanism involving IL- 1 generation which could have bearing on the in vivo pyrogenic effects of purified <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} human malignant {{squamous cell}} lines (SCL- 1 and SW- 1271) and normal human foreskin fibroblasts {{were treated with}} recombinant human alpha, beta, and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferons.</b> HLA-DR expression was induced in a concentration-dependent fashion only on the SCL- 1 cells treated with recombinant human <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> (r-IFN-γ) (102 - 103 U/ml). No HLA-DR expression was observed with alpha or beta interferon on either malignant squamous cell line, nor with <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> on SW- 1271 cells. All three interferons {{reduced the number of}} malignant cells growing in culture but had no effect on the fibroblasts. There was a concentration-dependent growth-inhibitory response of the malignant cells by the interferons (dose range 1 - 103 U/ml; 7. 1 × 10 - 12 M to 7. 1 × 10 - 9 M). The SCL- 1 cells were 102 more sensitive (based on weight) to the antiproliferative effects of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> than alpha or beta interferon. A brief (30 -min) exposure of the SCL- 1 cells to r-IFN-γ (102 and 102 U/mI) produced approximately the same inhibition of cell growth as continuous exposure over a 2 -week period. The SW- 1271 cells were equally sensitive to alpha, beta, and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferons.</b> However, the maximal inhibitory effect on SW- 1271 cells was less than that observed for the SCL- 1 cells. combining beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> resulted in cytotoxicity with SCL- 1 cells and additive cytostatic effect on the SW- 1271 cells. These additional malignant cell lines with their different sensitivities to alpha, beta, and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferons</b> may prove useful in studying the mechanisms of action of various interferons...|$|R
