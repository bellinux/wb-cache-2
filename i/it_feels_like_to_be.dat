500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She {{wanted to make a}} video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and just what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{are worried}} because Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) has not left her abusive husband, Cooter (Eric Bruskotter), as she claimed. Beiste tells them that adult {{relationships}} {{are more complex}} and insists she is fine. Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not know what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass. As the episode ends, Rachel and Tina sing [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", and board the glee club's bus to Nationals.|$|E

2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I know what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suicidal, and I know what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself {{to know that}} I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, {{and then the next}} thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine {{what it feels like to}} not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clements and Musker {{had agreed}} from {{very early on}} that the style they were aiming for was {{primarily}} that of Lady and the Tramp (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents [...] "the pinnacle of Disney's style". [...] "After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians– which are fantastic films as well, but there's a particular style (to 'Lady and the Tramp') that's so classically Disney." [...] Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed {{the style of the}} New Orleans scenes, while Disney's Bambi (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes. Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding [...] "Bambi painted what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the forest instead of the forest" [...] so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.|$|E

He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get {{on the other side of}} that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
