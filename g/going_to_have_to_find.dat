This followed widespread opposition to the introduction of the states ill conceived outcomes based education system into the school system that Axworthy was in charge of. As a result, the Council was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its fourth Chief in twelve months.|$|E

Eventually, Kayoko helps Noriko get over her sexual hang-ups in a session of lesbian love. In the end, Noriko and Yasuo {{discover}} a common ground and begin a romantic relationship. The series is in a way a mix of mecha-fights and sexual interaction between the main characters.|$|E
40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R

In a last-ditch effort to stop Bethany from trusting Angel, Lilah reveals that Angel is a vampire - to which an unfazed Bethany merely replies; [...] "weird."

5000|$|While in {{quarantine}} awaiting {{his prison}} assignment, Dawkins {{wrote down the}} first line of his short story [...] "County", inspired by his experience being incarcerated in the Kalamazoo County jail. Dawkins began writing in prison, explaining: [...] "A part of me realized, if I'm going to live through this, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a purpose." [...] He used an electric typewriter to write short stories and mailed them to his sister who submitted his work to literary magazines. A few of Dawkins' stories were published in less-well-known journals, and in 2016, a selection of his short stories eventually {{came to the attention of}} a literary agent who took Dawkins on as a client. Dawkins' stories were then sold to American publisher Scribner for a six-figure advance, with Dawkins' share going to an education fund for his children.|$|E

[...] The Deputy Director of the Institute of Public Affairs of the Universidad de Chile Robert Funk added: [...] "Latin America is not a priority in terms of foreign policy in the general sense, or {{at least in the short}} term. No one's going to come to Chile because Obama won. That didn't happen last time, and this time people actually know what Obama's about. It's a challenge for Chile. Brazil is going to become a major power in the region and Chile’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to deal with that and to balance that with the United States.

50|$|Maddox {{comes up}} with {{the theory that the}} plasma {{responds}} to both the conscious and the subconscious contents of the minds of those who are around it. Maddox decides that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to control his subconscious if he wants to learn to control the plasma. He works with the rings and the plasma while going through a kind of “house cleaning” of his subconscious mind and becomes better able to control the mysterious plasma. He feels that controlling the plasma is the key to destroying the Cities of Force. As he progresses in his work with the plasma, he becomes telepathic, and can telepathically communicate with Edie. They work out a plan to abandon the baby Sphere, as it has been getting bigger and more dangerous, by going to the nearby City of Force. When they get to the city they discover that they are able to affect the city with their newly concentrated minds. They can create walls, doors, and structures. Maddox isn't perfect in his control; he makes some mistakes, especially while unsuccessfully trying to protect a pregnant woman who is close to giving birth. The spheres do not allow new babies to live, and there haven't been a birth since the Spheres conquered the earth.|$|E

5000|$|In April, 2013, Calgary's {{community}} and protective services committee approved {{the location of}} an [...] "indoor multisport complex in the northwest, at Foothills Athletic Park at University Drive and 24th Avenue N.W. At {{that time it was}} noted by Donna Dixon, then head of the Calgary Multisport Fieldhouse Society, that even though {{there was a lot of}} support from the city, council and administration to look very hard at trying to find funding sources... the time frame is probably still five years out, because the funding hasn't been found yet. After the decision was made to prioritize the building of the Fieldhouse, Alderman Brian Pincott commented, [...] "Putting the fieldhouse first means we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a great gob of money for that first.

[...] In the 2015 CalgaryNext proposal the fieldhouse—a [...] "hub of pro and amateur sporting activity"—would be located in the West Village along the Bow River The second facility would be a combination Canadian Football stadium that would seat 30,000-50,000 spectators and public fieldhouse that would be constructed to also meet FIFA standards for soccer and would include a 400-metre indoor running track, volleyball, basketball, tennis and badminton courts. It is proposed to be a fixed-roof facility with a partially translucent roof to allow for natural sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pilot was}} written by Chris Carter, {{best known as the}} creator of the science-fiction series The X-Files. Carter wrote the pilot as a [...] "high-tech version" [...] of his {{favorite}} films—Paths of Glory, Platoon and Blade Runner. He said of the pilot: [...] "I think this has a tremendous romantic story and a great mythology potential, as well. I think it's a great chance to tell allegorical stories … to take a godless world, where there is no morality, where there is no standard or code of behavior, and see what the world would be like if it were like that." [...] The Fox executives worried that pilot episode included too much violence for the 8:00 p.m. timeslot, and they tried to get the producers of the show to tone the violence down in upcoming episodes. American writer Judd Apatow said he doubted Carter would tone down the violence: [...] "He's going to do what he wants to do, and he should. I don't think it's his place to tone it down for people. It's parents' place to say, 'You know what? You're not allowed to watch Harsh Realm'. But it's much easier to say, 'Take off the shows' than to tell parents to be aware of what their kids are doing." [...] Terry O'Quinn stars in the episode as Omar Santiago. He was concerned that the viewers would find the show confusing, [...] "There might be some things if you miss the first one you won't know what is going on. The writers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a good one- or two-minute intro that explains things." [...] When O'Quinn first read the script of the pilot, he [...] "pretty much understood the concept of the show when I read it, but I had a hard time visualizing it. I'm kind of computer illiterate. So I had a tough time seeing it. But the fact that Carter is doing it is a good starting point." ...|$|E
5000|$|Two Guardian reviews were issued. The first, {{observed}} by Kitty Empire, awarded the album three stars out of five. Conversely, the second Guardian review, {{observed by}} Hermione Hoby, was mixed and awarded it two stars out of five.

[...] She compared the work, including [...] "Like a Champion", to Rihanna. August Brown from the Los Angeles Times found that the album was [...] "the kind of album one makes in 2013 {{if you want to keep}} the pop sugar of the Disney tween cabal but mix in some broken glass and a club bathroom nosebleed. Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode ..." [...] Natalie Palmer from Entertainmentwise took perspective of other critics and commentators, saying the album should have been praised for [...] "trying something new". She discussed [...] "'Stars Dance' isn't what you would expect from a girl who was once a Disney princess. Many often go for the bubblegum pop or the angry rock chick but the 21-year-old has opted for an edgier genre and a unique sound." [...] Matthew Horton from Virgin Media awarded the album two stars. He criticized her [...] "lack of personality" [...] in most songs and felt her vocal abilities on the album [...] "doesn't help". He concluded saying [...] "It's all too identikit, and could be anyone with a grasp of average dance-pop". Simon Price from The Independent awarded one star out of the five, criticizing the lack of effort saying that [...] "Even given these facts, it's a pop record, which means one killer track would redeem everything. Predictably enough, it never comes." [...] Ron Harris from The Huffington Post felt the album did not live up to expectations, citing Gomez as a [...] "vibrant young woman of Disney pedigree who simply punched the clock and worked through an already cooked musical plot foisted upon her. Gomez might be an incredibly talented and interesting person with much to offer artistically, but we'll never find out at this rate." [...] He also found the album to have less personality than her previous records with The Scene.|$|E

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fire me! You want to fire me? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Climate {{change is}} the number one threat to the 22, 000 polar bears that remain in the world. Currently, polar bears are {{suffering}} from a loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic. Polar bears are dependent upon an Arctic sea ice environment for their continued existence. As sea ice is being reduced in the Arctic, the polar bears ’ basis for survival is being threatened. Because the sea ice is melting earlier in the spring, polar bears are being forced to the land without building up sufficient fat reserves to survive until the next freeze up. By {{the end of the summer}} they are skinny bears and in places like the Hudson Bay in Canada their ability to successfully raise a litter is being jeopardized. Inuit people are also affected by warming climate. Their way of life and their culture is based on sea ice. “Inuit are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new ways to make a living from the land, ” said Jose A. Kusugak, a Canadian Inuit and former president of the Inuit Tapirit Kanatami. - 4 He continued that, “our millennia-old traditions are already being altered because of the warming Arctic, and we face the possibility of having to completely reinvent what it means to be Inuit. This is a prospect we fear. ...|$|E
