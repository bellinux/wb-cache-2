40|$|Purpose Assessing the {{recovery}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> after intravenous sedation in the elderly is important for ensuring their safe discharge, especially when they are walking. A reliable, simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> would be useful in daily clinical practice. We observed {{the recovery}} of balance after intravenous sedation with midazolam, using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), and we evaluated {{the correlation between the}} CDP result and the results of simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods Midazolam was administered in divided doses, until the Wilson sedation score reached 3, in 18 elderly male volunteers. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> using CDP with perturbation stimuli was performed before and after sedation. As simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests,</b> the usual-speed walking (USW) and maximum-speed walking (MSW) tests and a modified timed “up and go” (TUG) test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 [*]m forward and return to the chair with MSW, and sit down again) were performed. Results The recovery times (defined as the time until the significant difference between the value at each time point and the baseline value disappeared) in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (CDP), USW test, MSW test, and TUG test, were 80, 40, 80, 80 [*]min, respectively. There was a significant, strong positive correlation between the result of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (CDP) and the TUG test (P < 0. 01; r = 0. 70). Conclusion The TUG test is a useful simple dynamic balance/motor test {{that can be used in}} daily clinical practice in the elderly...|$|R

The subjects were 22 preschool children (age, 5. 0 + 0. 4 years; height, 107. 3 + 5. 7 cm; weight, 17. 9 + 3. 4 kg). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> was assessed by walking the length of a balance beam several times (beam height, 30 cm; width, 10 cm; length, 200 cm) and walking a pathway (width, 10 cm; length, 200 cm). Physical fitness was assessed with activities such as a 25 -meter run, continuous bilateral hopping, upright hand standing, standing long jump, and catching a ball. Significant moderate or high correlations were found between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> (r = 0. 57), between walking the balance beam and continuous bilateral hopping tests (r = 0. 47) and catching a ball tests (r = 0. 71), and between walking a pathway and catching a ball tests (r = 0. 57). In conclusion, both walking a balance beam and pathway showed a relationship to coordination. Walking a balance beam successfully was also positively correlated with agility. However, the relationships between these two <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> were not as high.

40|$|Falls are {{commonly}} reported {{by people with}} Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). This study explores whether <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> can predict falls and which impairments relate to performance of these tests. We measured isokinetic lower limb muscle strength, sensory impairment, disease severity (CMT examination Score) and balance confidence (Modified Falls Self Efficacy scale). Falls events were recorded over 6 months using weekly postcards. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> was <b>tested</b> in the movement laboratory using kinematic analysis of a forward and lateral reach task. An infrared marker {{was placed on the}} right ulnar styloid and participants were asked to maximally reach forward and to the side without stepping. The distance reached was recorded for an average of three trials. Static standing balance was also measured by the velocity and path length of the centre of pressure (COP) using a force plate. Negative binomial regression analysis explored whether forward reach, lateral reach and static balance performance predicted falls. A linear regression analysis explored the impairments that predicted performance of the forward and lateral reach tests. Twenty seven participants completed the reach tests. The negative binomial multiple regression indicated that forward reach and COP velocity significantly predicted falls (R 2 = 0. 14, P< 0. 001). Performance of forward reach was predicted by knee extensor peak torque (R 2 = 0. 23, P= 0. 09) and lateral reach by ankle inverter peak torque (R 2 = 0. 34, P< 0. 001). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>testing</b> may indicate potential falls risk in people with CMT, as has also been demonstrated in older people...|$|R

Methods: Fourteen young male volunteers underwent intravenous sedation with propofol and midazolam for 1 h each at an interval of more than 1 week. Computerized dynamic posturography using a multi-axial tilting platform, the 10 -m maximum-speed walking test and the timed ‘up & go’ test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 m and back with maximum speed and sit down again) were performed before and after sedation. The increase in each variable of the tests described above represents a reduction of function. Results: The score of the computerized dynamic posturography was significantly lower in propofol sedation than that in midazolam sedation until 40 min after the end of sedation (P = 0. 006). The scores of maximum-speed walking test and timed ‘up & go’ test were significantly lower in propofol sedation than those in midazolam sedation till 60 min after the end of sedation, respectively (P = 0. 035 and 0. 042).

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is a neuromuscular multisystemic disorder with slowly progressive muscle weakness. The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis was, in adult patients with DM 1, to investigate factors of importance for functional balance skills and falls, and to investigate the natural course of muscle force and functional balance impairments, with reliable measurement methods. Methods: In the first study we evaluated test-retest reliability in static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> and gait, with three assessment occasions spaced oneweek apart, in ten patients with DM 1. In the second study, which is a crosssectional study, 51 patients were assessed for muscle strength, gait and functional balance together with self-reported balance confidence, walking ability and falls. A multivariate analysis of factors of importance for functional balance impairment was performed. Of these 51 patients, 43 were further analysed in a third five-year prospective study for changes in muscle force, gait and functional balance together with self-reported balance confidence, walking ability and falls. Results: The test-retest reliability analysis results advocate <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> and timed gait before the static tests. The cross-sectional study shows that falls are common in the weaker, but still ambulant, patients. A combination of weak ankle muscles and a physical capability to accelerate to fast walking increased the risk of falling. Over five years the distal muscles of the leg have a more steep force decrease than the proximal muscles. There was a tendency towards a greater worsening in males, and we found {{a statistically significant difference}} between genders in the knee extensor and flexor force change. All men had fallen within the previous year at the fiveyear assessment. Injuries of the face and head were more frequent at five years. Conclusions: Test-retest reliable <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> and isometric muscle force measures showed that there is a statistically significant decrease in functional balance skill and in leg muscle force after five years in patients with DM 1. The number of patients who had fallen had increased and the fall injuries were worse. It is of great importance to prevent falls especially in those who are at most risk for falls, by which we mean those who have a more steep muscle force reduction. Regular assessments of gait, functional balance and leg muscle force could be a way to determine who is at most risk for falls.

Setting: Sports-injury clinic. Participants: 21 athletes completing the event (age 44. 8 ± 8. 09  yrs, mass 74. 4 ± 13. 14  kg, years running 10. 4 ± 7. 39  yrs, average weekly mileage 44. 8 ± 12. 09  miles) entered the study. Ten athletes completed the JPS testing and five athletes completed the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>testing.</b> Assessment of Risk Factors: Risk factors were assessed {{the day before the}} event (day zero) and then following completion of one (day one), five (day five) and nine (day nine) consecutive marathons. The independent variable was time. Main Outcome Measurements: JPS error into flexion and extension, star-excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (SEBT) and number of injuries per runner. Results: Friedman's ANOVAs indicated no effects of time on JPS into extension (p= 0. 94), dominant-leg anterior (p= 0. 52) or posterior-lateral (p= 0. 65) SEBT reach. JPS flexion error significantly decreased by 1. 3 ° from day one to five (p= 0. 032). Non-dominant leg anterior, posterior-medial and posterior-lateral SEBT reaches significantly decreased from day zero to nine by 0. 09...|$|R

This modified version, the Lateral Functional Reach (LFR) incorporates <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>testing</b> in the scapular plane. Fifty female volunteers were recruited from a Senior Center in Holland, Michigan. Each subject completed the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the FR, and the LFR tests. Prior to testing, each subject was screened for depression, cognition and gross medical history. Validity and reliability of the LFR was determined through correlational and test-retest analysis. The correlation coefficient of the LFR with the BBS was, rs= 0. 5243 (p 3 ̆c. 05). The correlation coefficient of the FR with the BBS was rs= 0. 5299 (p 3 ̆c. 05). The correlation coefficient of the LFR with the FR was rp= 0. 7106 (p 3 ̆c. 05) and rs= 0. 6826 (p 3 ̆c. 05).

40|$|The Posturomed {{device is}} used as a {{scientific}} tool to quantify human <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability due to unexpected perturbations, and as a training device. Consequently, the question arises whether such measurements are compromised by learning effects. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze inter- and intra-day reliability of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> responses using the Posturomed. Thirty healthy young subjects participated (24. 3 ± 3. 2 years). The Posturomed was equipped with a triggering mechanism to enable unexpected, horizontal platform perturbations. A force platform was used to quantify Center of Pressure (COP) excursions for two time intervals: interval 1 (0 - 70 ms post perturbation) and interval 2 (71 - 260 ms post perturbation). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in single leg stances in medio-lateral and anterior-posterior perturbation directions. Inter- and intra-day reliability were assessed descriptively using Bland-Altman plots and inferentially using tests for systematic error and intra-class-correlations. With regard to the mean COP excursions for every subject and all intervals, some cases revealed significant differences between measurement sessions, however, none were considered relevant. Furthermore, intra class correlation coefficients reflected high magnitudes, which leads to the assumption of good relative reliability. However, analyzing inter- and intra-day reliability using Bland-Altman plots revealed one exception: intra-day comparisons for the anterior-posterior direction in interval 2, which points towards possible learning effects. In summary, results reflected good overall reliability with the exception of certain intra-day comparisons in the anterior-posterior perturbation direction, which could indicate learning effects in those particular conditions...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the concurrent validity and reliability of kinematic data recorded using a marker-based three dimensional motion analysis (3 DMA) system and the Kinect V 2 during a variety of static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> assessments. Thirty healthy adults performed two sessions, separated by one week, consisting of static standing <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> under different visual (eyes open vs. closed) and supportive (single limb vs. double limb) conditions, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> consisting of forward and lateral reach and an assessment of limits of stability. Marker coordinate and joint angle data were concurrently recorded using the Kinect V 2 skeletal tracking algorithm and the 3 DMA system. Task-specific outcome measures from each system on Day 1 and 2 were compared. Concurrent validity of trunk angle data during the dynamic tasks and anterior–posterior range and path length in the static balance tasks was excellent (Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s r 3 ̆e 0. 75). In contrast, concurrent validity for medial–lateral range and path length was poor to modest for all trials except single leg eyes closed balance. Within device test–retest reliability was variable; however, the results were generally comparable between devices. In conclusion, the Kinect V 2 has the potential to be used as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of some aspects of balance performance...|$|R
40|$|The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is one {{functional}} {{clinical test}} that widely {{used to assess}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in patients with ankle injuries. Since the ability of this test to detect impairments between athletes with and without chronic ankle instability(CAI) is not clear, the aim of {{present study was to}} determine if the modified SEBT could detect reach deficits in patients with unilateral CAI. A convenience sample of thirty elite and sub elite women athletes were selected and assigned into two groups: CAI group (Mean ± SD: age: 25 ± 3. 5 years; height: 1. 68 ± 0. 09 m; weight: 62. 7 ± 7. 3 kg), and healthy controls (Mean ± SD: age: 26 ± 4. 2 years; height: 1. 69 ± 0. 05 m; weigh t: 62. 7 ± 7. 3 kg). The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> was obtained using modified SEBT from both limbs of each participant. The independent sample t-test was used for both between group and within group inter-limb comparisons. There {{was no significant difference in}} any directions of modified SEBT between two groups in both limbs. No significant interlimb differences were also observed within both groups. The modified SEBT may not enough sensitive to differentiate between athletes with and without CAI. Other factors such as ankle range of motion, muscle strength and pain intensity should be considered for better interpretation of the SEBT results. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Determinants {{of balance}} {{have not been}} well studied in women with {{osteoporosis}} yet falls are the major cause of fracture in this population. Objective: To describe the associations among knee extension strength, medication history, medical history, physical activity and both static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in women diagnosed with osteoporosis. Methods: We assessed health history, current medication {{and quality of life}} by questionnaire in 97 community-dwelling women with osteoporosis. Static balance was measured by computerized dynamic posturography (Equitest), <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> by timed figure-eight run, and knee extension strength by dynamometry. Results: The 97 participants (mean (SD) age 69 (3. 2) years) had a mean lumbar spine BMD of T = - 3. 3 (0. 7) and total hip BMD of - 2. 9 (0. 4). In stepwise linear regression, the significant determinants of static balance that explained 18 % of total variance were knee extension strength (10 %, p < 0. 001), age (5 %, p < 0. 01) and tobacco use (3 %, p < 0. 05). The significant predictors of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> were knee extension strength (26 %, p < 0. 001), medications (6 %, p < 0. 05), age (4 %, p < 0. 05), height (4 %, p < 0. 001), as well as years of estrogen use (2 %), tobacco use (2 %) and weight (2 %) (all p < 0. 05). Knee extension strength was also associated with quality of life (r 2 = 0. 12, p < 0. 001). Based on these models, a 1 kg/cm (~ 3 %) increase in mean knee extension strength was associated with 1. 2, 2. 4 and 3. 4 % greater static <b>balance,</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and quality of life, respectively. Conclusions: Knee extension strength is a significant determinant of performance on static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> in 65 - to 75 -year-old women with osteoporosis. In this cross-sectional study, knee extension strength explained a greater proportion of the variance in <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> than did age.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether textured surfaces alter postural stability and lower limb muscle activity during quiet bipedal standing balance with eyes open. Anterior–posterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sway variables and the intensity of electromyographic (EMG) activity in eight dominant lower limb muscles were collected synchronously over 30 s in 24 young adults under three randomised conditions: control surface (C), texture 1 (T 1) and texture 2 (T 2). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that the textured surfaces did not significantly affect AP or ML postural sway in comparison to the control condition (p> 0. 05). Neither did the textured surfaces significantly alter EMG activity in the lower limbs (p> 0. 05). Under the specific conditions of this study, texture did not affect either postural sway or lower limb muscle activity in static bipedal standing. The results of this study point to three areas of further work including the effect of textured surfaces on postural stability and lower limb muscle activity: (i) in young healthy adults under more vigorous <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests,</b> (ii) post-fatigue, and (iii) in older adults presenting age-related deterioration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this nonexperimental case-control study was to compare the {{postural}} control abilities in normal subjects (n= 25) and patients with chronic low back pain (n= 25), selected by nonprobability convenient sampling. The Biodex balance system was used to implement dynamic test in four positions including double-leg eyes-open (DEO), double-leg eyes-closed (DEC), single-leg eyes-open (SEO), single-leg eyes-closed (SEC) and dynamic limits-of-stability (LOS) test. Overall, anteroposterior and mediolateral stability indices as wall as the time percent of zone A (< 5 ˚ inclination) were measured in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> while the completation time and overall directional control were measured in LOS test. Independent-t test (α = 0. 05) were used to compare dependent variables between two groups. All dependent variables showed statistically significant difference (P< 0. 01) {{between the two groups}} except for AP stability index in DEO position. The most obvious differences were seen with eye closure and in ML indices. Based on these results, chronic low back pain patients had abnormalities in balance control both during body maintainance and weight shift. The patients had visual dependency and lateral instability. Balance problems, motor control abnormalities, proprioceptive deficits and muscular stabilizing systems of lumbopelvic region must be considered for successful evaluation and management in patients with chronic low back pai...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Balance is {{a complex}} construct, {{affected}} by multiple components such as strength and co-ordination. However, whilst assessing an athlete's <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> {{is an important part}} of clinical examination, there is no gold standard measure. The multiple single-leg hop-stabilization test is a functional test which may offer a method of evaluating the <b>dynamic</b> attributes of <b>balance,</b> but it needs to show adequate intra-tester reliability. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the intra-rater reliability of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test,</b> the multiple single-leg hop-stabilization test on the dominant and non-dominant legs. DESIGN: Intra-rater reliability study. METHODS: Fifteen active participants were tested twice with a 10 -minute break between tests. The outcome measure was the multiple single-leg hop-stabilization test score, based on a clinically assessed numerical scoring system. Results were analysed using an Intraclass Correlations Coefficient (ICC 2, 1) and Bland-Altman plots. Regression analyses explored relationships between test scores, leg dominance, age and training (an alpha level of p[*]=[*] 0. 05 was selected). RESULTS: ICCs for intra-rater reliability were 0. 85 for the dominant and non-dominant legs (confidence intervals[*]=[*] 0. 62 - 0. 95 and 0. 61 - 0. 95 respectively). Bland-Altman plots showed scores within two standard deviations. A significant correlation was observed between the dominant and non-dominant leg on balance scores (R(2) = 0. 49, p< 0. 05), and better balance was associated with younger participants in their non-dominant leg (R(2) = 0. 28, p< 0. 05) and their dominant leg (R(2) = 0. 39, p< 0. 05), and a higher number of hours spent training for the non-dominant leg R(2) = 0. 37, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The multiple single-leg hop-stabilisation test demonstrated strong intra-tester reliability with active participants. Younger participants who trained more, have better <b>balance</b> scores. This <b>test</b> may be a useful measure for evaluating the <b>dynamic</b> attributes of <b>balance.</b> LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3...|$|R
