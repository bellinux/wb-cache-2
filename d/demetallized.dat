50|$|More than 400 {{corporate}} and Government companies are clients of EDAPS and need the holographic {{security of documents}} and goods, including excisable ones. Specialists of the Specialized Enterprise HOLOGRAPHY, {{a member of the}} EDAPS Consortium, designed the state-of-the-art technologies for hologram production: <b>demetallized</b> high resolution holograms, bigrams, BEPRINT holograms, etc.|$|E
50|$|Demetallization: The {{commercial}} proprietary Demet Process removes {{nickel and}} vanadium from the withdrawn spent catalyst. The nickel and vanadium are converted to chlorides {{which are then}} washed out of the catalyst. After drying, the <b>demetallized</b> catalyst is recycled into the circulating catalyst. Removals of about 95 percent nickel removal and 67 to 85 percent vanadium have been reported. Despite that, {{the use of the}} Demet process has not become widespread, perhaps because of the high capital expenditure required.|$|E
5000|$|For 10 {{years the}} specialists of SE Holography has devised {{a variety of}} {{developments}} and innovations in applied optics. Thus the <b>demetallized</b> hologram outmatches in resolution (dpi) similar inventions on the global market. The enterprise constantly participates in events such as international conferences and exhibitions on security printing and holography (Holopack-Holoprint, INTERGRAF, Holoexpo, etc.). The Holography’s in-house developments are manufacturing technology for bigrams, biprint technology. The area of expertise is the development and mastering of holographic elements for anti-counterfeiting solutions to protect products and documents.

40|$|When the Mn 2 + and Ca 2 + ions {{normally}} {{present in}} concanavalin A are removed, the protein becomes incapable of binding saccharides. To explore the structural {{differences between the}} native and <b>demetallized</b> forms and their effects on the saccharide-binding properties of the protein, we have refined and compared the crystal structures of both forms. Refinement, carried out by automated difference Fourier methods, has revealed a number of {{differences between the two}} structures as well as minor differences between the two crystallographically independent monomers in the <b>demetallized</b> structure. Significant differences between the holo- and apoproteins are confined to the region where the metals are bound. These differences include a reorganization and disordering of the loop, consisting of residues 7 - 25, that contains all of the direct metal ligands of the protein. In some molecules, the side chain of arginine- 228 appears to move into the metal-binding region, possibly compensating in part for the absence of the metal's positive charge. The cis peptide observed in the native protein at alanine- 207 is apparently not present in the <b>demetallized</b> protein. The conformational differences affect many of the residues currently thought {{to be involved in the}} specific binding of saccharides...|$|E
40|$|Histamine release {{induced by}} plant lectins was studied with {{emphasis}} on the carbohydrate specificity, external calcium requirement, metal binding sites, and mast cell heterogeneity and {{on the importance of}} antibodies bound to the mast cell membrane to the lectin effect. Peritoneal mast cells were obtained by direct lavage of the rat peritoneal cavity and guinea pig intestine and hamster cheek pouch mast cells were obtained by dispersion with collagenase type IA. Histamine release was induced with concanavalin A (Con A), lectins from Canavalia brasiliensis, mannose-specific Cymbosema roseum, Maackia amurensis, Parkia platycephala, Triticum vulgaris (WGA), and <b>demetallized</b> Con A and C. brasiliensis, using 1 - 300 µg/ml lectin concentrations applied to Wistar rat peritoneal mast cells, peaking on 26. 9, 21. 0, 29. 1, 24. 9, 17. 2, 10. 7, 19. 9, and 41. 5 %, respectively. This effect was inhibited in the absence of extracellular calcium. The lectins were also active on hamster cheek pouch mast cells (except <b>demetallized</b> Con A) and on Rowett nude rat (animal free of immunoglobulins) peritoneal mast cells (except for mannose-specific C. roseum, P. platycephala and WGA). No effect was observed in guinea pig intestine mast cells. Glucose-saturated Con A and C. brasiliensis also released histamine from Wistar rat peritoneal mast cells. These results suggest that histamine release induced by lectins is influenced by the heterogeneity of mast cells and depends on extracellular calcium. The results also suggest that this histamine release might occur by alternative mechanisms, because the usual mechanism of lectins is related to their binding properties to metals from which depend the binding to sugars, which would be their sites to bind to immunoglobulins. In the present study, we show that the histamine release by lectins was also induced by <b>demetallized</b> lectins and by sugar-saturated lectins (which would avoid their binding to other sugars). Additionally, the lectins also released histamine from Rowett nude mast cells that are free of immunoglobulins...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{parameters of}} <b>demetallized</b> alpha-lactalbumin {{in the range}} from pH 8 to 2 show an extreme around pH 5 - 4 (a minimum in quantum yield and wavelength and a maximum in polarization). This extreme is not due to a competition between Ca 2 + and protons but rather to a stabilization of the conformation of the protein near the isoelectric pH by the ionic interactions between local positive and negative charges on the protein. The calcium-free protein has similar fluorescence characteristics at pH 2 and 8 but the thermal transition curve is different. The influence of 0. 1 M NaCl is also considered. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between Concanavalin A (ConA) and the lanthanide ions La 3 + and Gd 3 + {{has been studied}} calorimetrically at 25 degrees C. The measurements were carried out at a pH of 4. 5, where the protein exists prevailingly as a dimer. Calorimetry allows the direct determination of the binding enthalpy and the evaluation of both the apparent association constant, and the apparent free energy and entropy. Three groups of data were collected. The first concerns {{the interaction of the}} 'native' protein, i. e., fully metallized with Mn 2 + and Ca 2 +, with the lanthanides. The second concerns the interaction of the completely <b>demetallized</b> protein with La 3 + and Gd 3 +. Finally, the affinity of each complex was tested for the specific sugar alpha-methylmannopyranoside. The analysis of the thermodynamic parameters obtained, led to the following conclusions: 1) a specific site, named S 3, exists on the protein for the lanthanides, distinct from the S 1 site of the transition metal and from the S 2 site, specific for calcium. There is only one S 3 site per protomer when the protein has Mn 2 + in S 1 and Ca 2 + in S 2. Moreover, there is no appreciable competition for S 1 and S 2 from the lanthanides. The 'native' protein, metallized with La 3 + or Gd 3 +, is a fully functional protein. 2) The <b>demetallized</b> protein (ApoCon A) has at least two sites per protomer for the lanthanides. The hypothesis is that, besides the S 3 site, the lanthanides, in the absence of Mn 2 +, can also occupy the S 1, but not the S 2, site. The protein metallized only with gadolinium ion is completely inactive toward the interaction with the mannoside. The same happens when, along with gadolinium, only calcium or manganese is present. Hence, {{in the absence of the}} transition metal in S 1 or of calcium in S 2, the protein is not in the conformation suitable to interact with its specific substrate...|$|E
40|$|The raw {{materials}} of secondary catalytic processes must be pre-refined. Among these refining processes are the deasphalting and demetallization including their thermo adsorption or thermo-contact adsorption variety. In oil processing four main processes of thermo-adsorption refining of hydrocarbon residues are used ART Asphalt Residual Treating - residues deasphaltizing 3 D Discriminatory Destructive Distillation {{developed in the}} US ACT Adsorption-Contact Treatment and ETCC Express Thermo-Contact Cracking developed in Russia. ART and ACT are processes with absorbers of lift type reactor while 3 D and ETCC processes are with an adsorbing reactor having ultra-short contact time of the raw material with the adsorbent. In all these processes refining of hydrocarbon residues is achieved by partial Thermo-destructive transformations of hydrocarbons and hetero-atomic compounds with simultaneous adsorption of the formed {{on the surface of}} the adsorbents resins asphaltene and carboids as well as metal- sulphur - and nitro-organic compounds. <b>Demetallized</b> and deasphalted light and heavy gas oils or their mixtures are a quality raw material for secondary deepening refining processes catalytic and hydrogenation cracking etc. since they are characterized by low coking ability and low content of organometallic compounds that lead to irreversible deactivation of the catalysts of these deepening processes...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} Cd {{exposure}} by synthesizing heavy-metal-binding oligopeptides, called phytochelatins (PCs). These peptides reduce {{the activity of}} Cd 2 + ions in the plant tissues by forming Cd chelates. The main objective of the present work was to develop an analytical technique, which allowed identication {{of the most prominent}} Cd species in plant tissue by SEC-ICP-MS and ESI-TOF-MS. An integrated part of the method development was to test the hypothesis that dierential Cd tolerance between two barley genotypes was linked to dierences in Cd speciation. Only one fraction of Cd species, ranging from 7001800 Da, was detected in the shoots of both genotypes. In the roots, two additional fractions ranging from 29004600 and 670015 000 Da were found. The Cd-rich SEC fractions were heart-cut, de-salted and <b>demetallized</b> using reversed-phase chromatography (RPC), followed by ESI-MS-TOF to identify the ligands. Three dierent families of PCs, viz. (gGlu-Cys) n-Gly (PCn), (gGlu-Cys) n-Ser (iso-PCn) and Cys-(gGlu-Cys) n-Gly (des-gGlu-PCn), the last lacking the N-terminal amino acid, were identied. The PCs induced by Cd toxicity also bound several essential trace elements in plants, including Zn, Cu, and Ni, whereas no Mn species were detected. Zn, Cu and Ni-species were distributed between the 7001800 Da and 670015 000 Da fractions, whereas only Cd species were found in the 29004600 Da fraction dominated by PC 3 ligands. Although the total tissue concentration of Cd was similar for the two species, the tolerant barley genotype synthesized signicantly more CdPC 3 species with a high Cd specicity than the intolerant genotype, clearly indicating a correlation between Cd tolerance and the CdPC speciation...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} remediation {{strategy that}} involved washing with complexing reagents(s) [disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na 2 EDTA) {{alone or in}} combination with bis-(2 -hydroxyethyl) dithiocarbamate (HEDC) ] was evaluated with an urban soil that had been field contaminated with excesses of heavy metal (HMs). Heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were targeted for removal. The aqueous solution that resulted from, washing was treated with zero-valent (ZV) magnesium (Mg 0) or bimetallic mixture (Pd 0 /Mg 0 or Ag 0 /Mg 0) to release the chelating reagent(s) from their heavy metal complexes. During this reaction, the heavy metals were precipitated from solution as hydroxides or became plated on {{to the surface of}} the excess ZV reagent. Thus, an appreciable fraction of the mobilized Pb and Cu and a portion of Zn became cemented {{to the surface of the}} ZV metal whereas most of the Fe and Mn were removed from solution as insoluble hydroxides. After filtration and pH re-adjustment, the <b>demetallized</b> solution was then returned to the soil to extract more heavy metals. After three washing cycles with the same reagent, it was observed that the sparing quantity of EDTA (10 mmoles) had mobilized 32 [...] 54 % of the soil burden heavy metals (5 mmoles), but only 0. 1 % of the iron had been removed. A 1 : 1 (mol/mol) mixture of EDTA and HEDC proved to be approximately equally efficient at HM extraction despite more than a three-fold reduction (3 mmoles) in the quantity of reagents. Three washing with the same reagent mobilized some 49 % of the Pb, 18 % of the Zn and 19 % of the Mn but only 7 % of the Cu and 1 % of the Fe from the test soil...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} effects of {{alternative}} fuels and raw materials on the cement clinker quality. The clinker quality was expressed by the content of two principal minerals alite C 3 S and belite C 2 S. The additions of alternative fuels ashes and raw materials, in principle, always increased the belite content and conversely reduced the amount of alite. The alternative fuels with high ash content were used such as the meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge and the used alternative raw materials were metallurgical slags - granulated blastfurnace slag, air cooled blastfurnace slag and <b>demetallized</b> steel slag, fluidized bed combustion fly ash and waste glass. Meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge were evaluated as moderately suitable alternative fuels which can be added in the amounts of 2. 8 wt. % addition of meat-bone meals ash, 3. 64 wt. % addition of sewage sludge ash and 3. 8 wt. % addition of paper sludge ash to the cement raw mixture. Demetallised steel slag is suitable for production of special sulphate resistant cement clinker for CEM I –SR cement with addition up to 5 wt. %. Granulated blastfurnace slag is a suitable alternative raw material with addition 4 wt. %. Air cooled blastfurnace slag is a suitable alternative raw material with addition 4. 2 wt. %. Waste glass is not very appropriate alternative raw material with addition only 1. 16 wt. %. Fluidized bed combustion fly ash appears not to be equally appropriate alternative raw material for cement clinker burning with less potential utilization in the cement industry and with addition 3. 41 wt. %, which forms undesired anhydrite CaSO 4 in the cement clinker...|$|E
