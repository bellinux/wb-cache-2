40|$|The fast {{development}} of LED and its applications has enabled {{a new generation}} of lighting device with higher efficiency and long lifespan. By employing a primary-side sensing flyback converter and the PIC 18 F micro-controller series, an LED driver could achieve two important features: (1) the compatibility with the available lighting fixtures, and (2) reducing unit price. The flyback converter was chosen for its simplicity, competitive low cost, and its ability to provide a constant output current, a necessarily important factor to an LED driver. Meanwhile, the PIC 18 F micro-controller series offer numerous advanced features which include but not limited to pulse-width modulation (PWM), 10 -bit 13 -channel Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) etc., which suitably meet the requirements for regulating a primary-side sensing flyback converter. The design process was first conducted in simulation stage with aid from Matlab®-Simulink and Cadence OrCAD Capture CIS (PSpice). By using PI based control scheme and making full use of built-in Analog Behavioral Modelling (ABM) blocks, the simulation-relevant difficulties due to lacking of appropriate model for the PIC 18 F series micro-controller were completely solved. The simulation results matched well with the intended design specifications: the output voltage is 32 VDC while the load current is 350 mA. More importantly, the simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of deploying a primary-side sensing flyback converter in conjunction with a PIC 18 F micro-controller as an LED driver. Next, a <b>demo</b> printed-circuit <b>board</b> (PCB) was layout by using OrCAD PCB Editor. Finally, the PIC 18 F 4550 micro-controller was programmed to undertake control tasks of the LED driver.

40|$|Abstract. The {{usage of}} the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) for neural network {{implementation}} provides flexibility in programmable systems. For the neural network based instrument prototype in real time application, conventional specific VLSI neural chip design suffers the limitation in time and cost. With low precision artificial neural network design, FPGAs have higher speed and smaller size for real time application than the VLSI design. In addition, artificial neural network based on FPGAs has fairly achieved with classification application. The programmability of reconfigurable FPGAs yields the availability of fast special purpose hardware for wide applications. Its programmability could set the conditions to explore new neural network algorithms and problems of a scale {{that would not be}} feasible with conventional processor. The goal of this work is to realize the hardware implementation of neural network using FPGAs.

40|$|The AC {{induction}} motor is the workhorse of modern industry. Worldwide about 50 million motors are installed every year that have greater than 1 / 2 hp. Today {{only a small}} percentage of these motors utilize variable speed drives. Almost half of the variable speed AC drives sold today are in the 1 to 5 hp range. Companies producing this range of drives are under a great deal of pressure to reduce costs. Lower system cost will result in higher volumes as more applications use variable speed.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, {{we present a}} dynamic gate biasing {{technique}} applied to a 10 W, S-band GaN amplifier. The proposed methodology addresses class-B operation of power amplifiers that offers the potential for high efficiency but requires a careful attention to maintain good linearity performances at large output power back-off. This work proposes a solution to improve the linearity of class-B amplifiers driven by radio frequency-modulated signals having large peak to average power ratios. An important aspect of this work concerns the characterization of the dynamic behavior of GaN devices for gate bias trajectory optimization. For that purpose, the experimental study reported here {{is based on the}} use of a time-domain envelope setup.

In addition was a Global Position System (GPS) receiver board, and a Radio Frequency (RF) communication board, developed. The GPS receiver was used to position the GS, and used as a source for position correction data. The RF communication board was developed for mounting in the CS and to be connected to its computer system to enable communication with the GS.

40|$|Overview: This design note {{describes}} how to incorporate an external circuit to provide dedicated output {{short circuit protection}} of the NCL 30051. Referring to Figure 1, In {{the event that the}} output is accidentally shorted to ground, the leakage inductance of the resonant half bridge transformer limits the current through the half bridge MOSFETS. Therefore, the higher the leakage inductance, the higher the impedance of the resonant tank circuit resulting in lower peak current in the MOSFET switches when the output is shorted. Since this is transformer dependent, it can be highly desirable to add protection that is not dependent on the transformer design and manufacturing variation. The described circuit has been validated on the existing NCL 30051 LED <b>Demo</b> <b>Board</b> to illustrate actual performance. Background: The NCL 30051 implements LED current regulation by controlling the bulk voltage provided by the PFC converter. The resonant half bridge provides voltage transformation as well as primary to secondary isolation. A minimum operating LED voltage is imposed by the minimum PFC voltage. This level can be no lower than the peak of the applied ac input voltage. If the LED voltage falls below this minimum operating voltage, the current in the LEDs and therefore the half bridge stage increases being limited only by the leakage inductance of the transformer. This half bridge converter uses series-connected capacitors to maintain transformer core volt-second balance by introducing an offset voltage at the midpoint as needed. During normal operation, there is also a small ac component at the half bridge frequency present on the midpoint between these ‘balancing ’ capacitors...|$|E
