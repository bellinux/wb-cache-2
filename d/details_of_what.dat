Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to Kanons beginning.

Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind.

Mexican authorities claimed Iguala's mayor, , and his wife María de los Ángeles Pineda Villa, masterminded the abduction. However, there are also reports linking Federal forces to the case, some stating that military personnel in the area deliberately omitted helping the students in distress.

Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit.|$|E
25|$|Recording {{took place}} {{intermittently}} between April and December 2000 at Sunlight Studios. Financial issues forced the band into recording it in spurts, throughout this time.

Shortly afterwards he was interviewed by the Palestine Police Force, and gave them the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened. Reports of the kidnapping also reached the Haganah in Netanya. Oved Ben-Ami, head of the Netanya council, called an emergency council meeting. He did not invite the Revisionist party members, who were identified with Irgun. The decision was made {{in accordance with the}} Yishuv's position, which was published the next day, calling the kidnapping a provocation that might jeopardize what hope was left for clemency for those condemned to death.

25|$|In practice, {{the walls}} of a sukkah can be {{constructed}} from any material that will withstand a normally anticipated terrestrial wind. If the material is not rigid and therefore will sway in the wind, the sukkah is not kosher (Talmud, Sukkah 24b). Accordingly, there is a discussion among contemporary halakhic authorities whether canvas may be used for walls: Some, such as R. Ovadiah Yosef (Shu"t Yechaveh Da'at 3:46) hold that even the slightest degree of swaying in the wind will disqualify the sukkah walls, and thus canvas cannot realistically be employed. Others, such as the Chazon Ish, permit motion to and fro of less than three handbreadths, thereby facilitating the usage of canvas walls. The specific <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a wall, the minimum and maximum wall heights, whether there can be spaces between the walls and the roof, and the exact material required for the s'chach (roofing) can be found in various exegetical texts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{followed}} {{during the}} students' {{clash with the}} police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the students because they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive them off {{to carry out the}} protests and then return to their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. His eyes had been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an [...] "elusive historical figure".

After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked on the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity.

In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was {{the full range of}} his depredations, including <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he did to some of his victims after their deaths.

In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless face, and he repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. [...] "If you've got time," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "they can be anything you want them to be."

500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand some of what was happening to me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers.
