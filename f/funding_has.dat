5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no <b>funding</b> <b>has</b> been committed to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. <b>Funding</b> <b>has</b> been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E

Known as Muchea to Wubin Stage 2 Upgrade, the project continues work undertaken on this section from 2000 to improve the road to National Highway standards. Several bypasses, realignments, and other improvements have been planned at or near Muchea, Bindoon, New Norcia, Walebing, Miling, Pithara, Dalwallinu, Nugadong, and Wubin. Sections near Bindi Bindi and Batty Bog, completed in 2015, {{were included in the}} review. The highest priority works are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019. These include the New Norcia Bypass, Milling Straight section, Muchea North section (designed to link to the NorthLink WA project), and Milling Bypass. , designs are being finalised for the Walebing Curve, Dalwallinu Bypass, Nugadong, and Wubin Bypass section, while <b>funding</b> <b>has</b> not been confirmed for the Bindoon upgrades.|$|E
5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. <b>Funding</b> <b>has</b> not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

40|$|Mutual Funds {{around the}} world have {{attracted}} trillions of dollars and millions of investors. Given the importance of the industry, performance evaluation of mutual <b>funds</b> <b>has</b> become the most commonly discussed topic in finance. Mutual <b>Funds</b> in Pakistan <b>have</b> recently become the centre of attraction for both practitioners and academics since the mutual <b>fund</b> industry <b>has</b> recently started to develop, and it has been hardly four to five years since most of the open-ended <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> been introduced. The assets under management of open-ended <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> swelled from PKR 25 billion in 1997 to PKR 340 billion in 2008. This paper attempts to examine the performance of newly introduced and rapidly growing open-ended funds in Pakistan, though some <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> been in existence for long. The study uses pioneering models of Mutual Fund performance proposed by Sharpe (1966), Treynor (1965) and Jensen (1967). The results of the evaluation indicate the performance of the funds being quite negative. But the performance evaluation also reveals some positive characteristics of the <b>funds</b> which <b>have</b> been discussed in the paper. Naturally, since most of the <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> hardly completed around three to four years of their operation, {{it is too early to}} conclude whether the overall performance of the industry is good or bad...|$|R
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with an alternate route that involved an indirection connection via the BL I-94 interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but since then, <b>funding</b> <b>has</b> not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this reason in the department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. The department has listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mutual <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> {{become an}} {{important}} part of the Swedish deposit market. Savings in mutual funds add up to almost 20 percent of the households'assets. When the pension reform is carried out all employees are going to have savings both in mutual and bond funds. But only if the fund overperforms the market it is worth investing. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore if Swedish mutual <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> generated higher returns than market portfolio in the late nineties. Research method: Returns of the mutual <b>funds</b> <b>have</b> been examined by four different measures. These are return on investment, the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio and Jensens alpha. Results: According to the results from my study only one mutual <b>fund</b> <b>has</b> performed better than the market on the average.
