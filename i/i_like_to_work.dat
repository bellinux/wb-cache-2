500|$|Taborn's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} came in 1994, {{and was released}} by DIW. Craig Taborn Trio, with bassist Jaribu Shahid and drummer Tani Tabbal, featured Taborn playing {{in a range of}} styles on piano and included several of his own compositions. At this stage in his career, his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were: [...] "Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music, I like to swing. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with harmony and melody in my own music, and I like acoustical instruments. But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section, and lay down in great detail what everyone is supposed to do and how they should do it." ...|$|E

60|$|DEAR MR. WALKER,--By gracious but {{you have}} a talent for making a man feel proud and good! To say a {{compliment}} well is a high art--and few possess it. You know how to do it, and when you confirm its sincerity with a handsome cheque the limit is reached and compliment can no higher go. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for you: when you don't approve an article you say so, recognizing that I am not a child and can stand it; and when you approve an article I don't have to dicker with you as if I raised peanuts and you kept a stand; I know I shall get every penny the article is worth.|$|E

60|$|If I had schoolmasters, my benevolent friend, do {{you imagine}} I would {{set them on}} {{teaching}} a set of unteachables, who as you perceive have already made up their mind that black is white,--that the Devil namely is the advantageous Master to serve in this world? My esteemed Benefactor of Humanity, it shall be far from me. Minds open to that particular conviction are not the material <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> upon. When once my schoolmasters have gone over all the other classes of society from top to bottom; and have no other soul to try with teaching, all being thoroughly taught,--I will then send them to operate on these regiments of the line: then, and, assure yourself, never till then. The truth is, I am sick of scoundreldom, my esteemed Benefactor; it always was detestable to me; and here where I find it lodged in palaces and waited on by the benevolent of the world, it is more detestable, not to say insufferable to me than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... ...I {{have been}} both very busy and very bent on getting away this year without fail, for a miracle, from the oppressive London season. I have just {{accomplished}} it; I passed the St. Gotthard day before yesterday, and I {{hope to find}} it possible to remain absent till August 1st. After that I am ready to pay cheerfully and cheaply for my journey by staying quietly in town for August and September, in {{the conditions in which}} you saw me last year. I shall take as much as possible of a holiday, for I have been working carefully, consecutively and unbrokenly {{for a very long time}} past--turning out one thing (always [...] "highly finished") after another. However, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> thank heaven, and at the end of a month's privation of it I sink into gloom and discomfort--so that I shall probably not wholly [...] "neglect my pen".... I hope you will have received promptly a copy of The Tragic Muse, though I am afraid I sent my list to the publishers a little late. I don't in the least know, however, when the book is supposed to come out. I have no opinion or feeling about it now--though I took long and patient and careful trouble (which no creature will recognise) with it at the time: too much, no doubt: for my mind is now a muddled, wearied blank on the subject. I have shed and ejected it--it's void and dead--and my feeling as to what may become of it is reduced to the sordid hope it will make a little money--which it won't.... The matter you expressed a friendly hope about the success of, and which for all sorts of reasons I desire to be extremely secret, silent and mysterious about--I mean the enterprise I covertly mentioned to you as conceived by me with a religious and deliberate view of gain over a greater scale than the Book (my Books at least) can ever approach bringing in to me: this matter is on a good and promising footing, but it is too soon to say anything about it, save that I am embarked in it seriously and with rather remarkably good omens. By which I mean that it is not to depend on a single attempt, but on half a dozen of the most resolute and scientific character, which I find I am abundantly capable of making, but which, alas, in the light of this discovery, I become conscious that I ought to have made ten years ago. I was then discouraged all round, while a single word of encouragement would have made the difference. Now it is late. But on the other hand the thing would have been then only an experiment more or less like another--whereas now it's an absolute necessity, imposing itself without choice if I wish a loaf on the shelf for my old age. Fortunately as far as it's gone it announces itself well--but I can't tell you yet how far that is. The only thing is to do a great lot.|$|E

Although the album failed to chart in the US, it received considerable critical acclaim with Robert Christgau observing [...] "...this is his best album because the songs are so much his catchiest and pithiest.

(…) When it comes to me, well <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as a cook, but at the moment I cannot, because of the {{children}} and the tasks around them (…) if the children grow up, then <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> again, but now it's not the time, my son is 7 and my daughter will be 5 in December (Paulina, 33, Germany, 2 children aged 4 & 7).|$|R

5000|$|Turner {{later said}} of the film's production, [...] "I {{remember}} terrible arguments Robert Zemeckis doing Romancing. He's a film-school grad, fascinated by cameras and effects. I never felt that he knew what I was having to do to adjust my acting {{to some of his}} damn cameras - sometimes he puts you in ridiculous postures. I'd say, 'This is not helping me! This is not the way <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> thank you!'"

50|$|Schmidt {{respected}} and admired {{the work of}} abstract and non-objective artists, but she never felt inclined to work in that style.

And I do my best work when I do that. I don't know whether it's just because I put it out of my mind that I don't like to make things up. Some artists are marvelous at just fantastic inventions.

2500|$|That was Roma's {{first major}} honour {{in a decade}} and only the third time ever {{that they had been}} crowned champions of Italy.

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{inspired}} by the belief that Francisco Varela’s last work, found in his essays between 1997 and 2000, contains several highly significant experimental and epistemological intuitions {{for the future of}} an approach to the study of cognitive and evolutionary developmental processes that we might start by describing as “anti-computationalist”. The assumption <b>I</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on is seeking inspiration in these intuitions to outline a possible “radical theory of emergence”, based on two essential remarks: 1) 	Developmental processes are phenomena of emergence from reticular connections that involve the integrated totality of the systems examined (internal source of order); 2) 	Developmental processes occur within structurally coupled systems whose co-evolutionary dynamic presents characteristics of irreductible unicity and contingency (external source of order) ...|$|R

Website Fingerprinting allows a local, passive eavesdropper who has access to the link between the Onion Proxy and the Entry Guard to learn user’s browser activity by leveraging packet sequence information. This attack breaks the privacy expectations of Tor users and although there are several countermeasures proposed,  none of them has been yet implemented. Most of these countermeasures are based on linkpadding. This consists in adding dummy cells to conceal features of the traffic that could be exploited by the adversary.
