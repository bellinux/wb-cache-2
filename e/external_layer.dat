5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the <b>external</b> <b>layer</b> can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

40|$|During {{development}} of the primary olfactory system, sensory axons project from the nasal cavity to the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. In the process axons can branch inappropriately into several glomeruli and sometimes over-shoot the glomerular layer, entering the deeper <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer.</b> However in the adult, axons are rarely observed within the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer.</b> While chemorepulsive cues are proposed to restrict axons to the glomerular layer in the embryonic animal, these cues are clearly insufficient for all axons in the postnatal animal. we hypothesised that the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> is initially {{an environment in which}} axons are able to grow but becomes increasingly inhibitory to axon growth in later postnatal development. We have determined that rather than having short localised trajectories as previously assumed, many axons that enter the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> had considerable trajectories and projected preferentially along the ventro-dorsal and rostro-caudal axes for up to 950 mu m. With increasing age, fewer axons were detected within the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> but axons continued to be present until P 17. Thus the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> is initially an environment in which axons can extensively grow. We next tested whether the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> became increasingly inhibitory to axon growth by microdissecting various layers of the olfactory bulb and preparing protein extracts. When assayed using olfactory epithelium explants of the same embryonic age, primary olfactory axons became increasingly inhibited by extract prepared from the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer</b> of increasingly older animals. These results demonstrate that primary olfactory axons can initially grow extensively in the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer,</b> but that during postnatal development inhibitory cues are upregulated that reduce axon growth within the <b>external</b> plexiform <b>layer.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The {{differences in the}} coefficient of thermal expansions between the alternating layers lead to residual stresses after cooling.

Different designs of laminates were produced with <b>external</b> <b>layers</b> under compression and tension exhibiting different failure mechanisms. Facture toughness was measured by SEVNB method. In systems with <b>external</b> <b>layers</b> under compression the measured fracture toughness was up to three times that of Si 3 N 4, i. e. up to 17 MPa m 1 / 2.

60|$|I {{went first}} to-day into the Townley Gallery, and so along {{through all the}} ancient sculpture, and was glad to find myself able to sympathize more than {{heretofore}} with the forms of grace and beauty which are preserved there,--poor, maimed immortalities as they are,--headless and legless trunks, godlike cripples, faces beautiful and broken-nosed,-- heroic shapes which have stood so long, or lain prostrate so long, in the open air, that even the atmosphere of Greece has almost dissolved the <b>external</b> <b>layer</b> of the marble; and yet, however much they may be worn away, or battered and shattered, the grace and nobility seem as deep in them as {{the very heart of}} the stone. It cannot be destroyed, except by grinding them to powder. In short, I do really believe that there was an excellence in ancient sculpture, which has yet a potency to educate and refine the minds of those who look at it even so carelessly and casually as I do. As regards the frieze of the Parthenon, I must remark that the horses represented on it, though they show great spirit and lifelikeness, are rather of the pony species than what would be considered fine horses now. Doubtless, modern breeding has wrought a difference in the animal. Flaxman, in his outlines, seems to have imitated these classic steeds of the Parthenon, and thus has produced horses that always appeared to me affected and diminutively monstrous.|$|E

Methods: We derive non-adiabatic parameters for delta Scuti stars by using, for the first time, stellar models with the same treatment of convection in the interior and in the atmosphere. We compute classical non-gray mixing length models, and as well non-gray ``full spectrum of turbulence'' (FST) models.

The generation time is 19 hr, presynthetlc time 8. 5 hr, DNA-synthetic time 8 hr, postsynthetic time 2 hr, and mitotic time 0. 5 hr. These proliferating cells occupy the outer {{half of the}} <b>external</b> granular <b>layer</b> and make up the <b>external</b> matrix <b>layer.</b> Neuroblasts are differentiated from the external matrix cell, migrate out from the layer and accumulate in the inner half of the <b>external</b> granular <b>layer</b> to form the <b>external</b> mantle <b>layer.</b> The transit time of the neuroblasts in the <b>external</b> mantle <b>layer</b> is 28 hr.

6000|$|Take a small india-rubber ball--not of the {{inflated}} kind, nor of {{the solid}} kind, but of the kind about {{an inch or so}} in diameter with a small hole through which, under pressure, the air escapes. Suppose that instead of consisting of india-rubber its wall consists of small cells made polyhedral in form by mutual pressure, and united together. This will represent the blastoderm. Now with the finger, thrust in one side of the ball until it touches the other: so making a cup. This action will stand for the process of invagination. Imagine that by continuance of it, the hemispherical cup becomes very much deepened and the opening narrowed, until the cup becomes a sac, of which the introverted wall is everywhere in contact with the outer wall. This will represent the two-layered [...] "gastrula"--the simplest ancestral form of the Metazoa: a form which is permanently represented in some of the lowest types; for it needs but tentacles round the mouth of the sac, to produce a common hydra. Here the fact which it chiefly concerns us to remark, is that of these two layers the outer, called in embryological language the epiblast, continues to carry on direct converse with the forces and matters in the environment; while the inner, called the hypoblast, comes in contact with such only of these matters as are put into the food-cavity which it lines. We have further to note that in the embryos of Metazoa at all advanced in organization, there arises between these two layers a third--the mesoblast. The origin of this is seen in types where the developmental process is not obscured by the presence of a large food-yolk. While the above-described introversion is taking place, and before the inner surfaces of the resulting epiblast and hypoblast have come into contact, cells, or amoeboid units equivalent to them, are budded off from one or both of these inner surfaces, or some part of one or other; and these form a layer which eventually lies between the other two--a layer which, as this mode of formation implies, never has any converse with the surrounding medium and its contents, or with the nutritive bodies taken in from it. The striking facts to which this description is a necessary introduction, may now be stated. From the outer layer, or epiblast, are developed the permanent epidermis and its out-growths, the nervous system, and the organs of sense. From the introverted layer, or hypoblast, are developed the alimentary canal and those parts of its appended organs, liver, pancreas, &c., which are concerned in delivering their secretions into the alimentary canal, as well as the linings of those ramifying tubes in the lungs which convey air to the places where gaseous exchange is effected. And from the mesoblast originate the bones, the muscles, the heart and blood-vessels, and the lymphatics, together with such parts of various internal organs as are most remotely concerned with the outer world. Minor qualifications being admitted, there remain the broad general facts, that out of that part of the <b>external</b> <b>layer</b> which remains permanently external, are developed all the structures which carry on intercourse with the medium and its contents, active and passive; out of the introverted part of this <b>external</b> <b>layer,</b> are developed the structures which carry on intercourse with the quasi-external substances that are taken into the interior--solid food, water, and air; while out of the mesoblast are developed structures which have never had, from first to last, any intercourse with the environment. Let us contemplate these general facts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Knowledge-based NMR {{spectral}} prediction {{relies on}} the correlations between substructures and sub-spectra. To extract the correlations, a systematic substructure measurement has been developed to classify substructures according to their chemical shift values. Historically, the atom center fragment (ACF) concept {{has been used as}} a means to systematically measure substructures for NMR spectral prediction. The assumption behind this concept is that the chemical shift value of an atom is influenced by its chemical environment. Based upon the study of the ACF-type approaches, a generalized atom center fragment (GACF) approach is proposed in this paper. In the GACF approach, a substructure consists of a center atom, core <b>layer,</b> and <b>external</b> <b>layers.</b> The center atom and the core layer, are identified as the super center atom. The <b>external</b> <b>layers</b> are the chemical environment.
