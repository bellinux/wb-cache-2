25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> is too focused on {{transport}} and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth.

40|$|An {{environmental}} review {{has been carried}} out at FORIA AB, a transportation- and machine service company, to analyze the company’s <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> from the transportation segment. This report describes the essential background and the methods of identifying and evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> It also describes how the work with the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> often vary between different actors. The design of the ISO 14001 is intentionally broad in order to apply on all sorts of activities and organizations. The report describes the ISO 14001 requirements regarding the work with the identification of the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and the requirements within the organization. Further, the report describes how the Swedish Transport Policy is designed, and how the transportation goal and the intermediate goal “good environment” looks like today. Transportation means in the extension an environmental impact of some kind. The emissions and discharge which derives from transport is accounted and also which impact they can have on the environment. The environmental investigation within the transportation segment at FORIA consists of a methodical and analytical procedure for identifying the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> has been designed. The <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> influence on the environment is valued and described. The valuation model is designed and developed for FORIA. Based on the evaluation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> within the transportation segment the concluded significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> are: fuel, noise and transport planning.

40|$|Education {{provided}} by schools {{requires that the}} teaching promotes sustainable development and help students to develop a commitment to influence development in a sustainable direction. Using ISO 14001, schools can reduce their environmental impact, while students become involved in environmental activities. This report shows how an initial environmental review of a pre- and elementary school can be conducted, and how short-term and long-term environmental targets for the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> can be identified. The initial environmental review of Nyckelknippan förskole AB can hopefully provide a basis on which {{the establishment of the}} environmental management system ISO 14001 can be developed. The methodology for the initial environmental review had a starting point of already proposed <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> that were investigated and quantified. A list of environmental laws was compiled and linked to the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were evaluated using an FMEA where the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were identified; energy consumption, chemical use, accidents, consumables, wastes, internal transportation and education. The proposals on objectives and targets for the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were linked to the Stockholm County regional environmental objectives and can be further developed together with teachers and students. It is possible to improve the initial environmental review in the future as part of the standard's requirements for continuous improvement, depending on if Nyckelknippan förskole AB chooses to continue the implementation of the environmental management system ISO 14001. ...|$|R

50|$|Sasaki {{helped to}} {{modernize}} the concepts of Landscape Architecture. He created a practical approach to designing a landscape. In his works, several characteristics are taken into account, such as the historical, cultural, environmental, and social use of the land. Sasaki became famous for developing this concept of interdisciplinary planning. In all of the sites that he developed, a balance is implemented into the design. One aspect that Sasaki Associates pays particular attention to is the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of the land. They have taken part in creating several “green designs.” These designs are created to enhance or maintain {{the health of the}} environment. Some of the prominent examples can be viewed at the Utah State University Innovation Campus, The Virginia Biosphere, Walden Woods, and the Manulife Financial U.S. Operations Headquarters. Another facet of Sasaki's approach was the modernism that he worked into his college campus projects.|$|E
50|$|Several {{themes are}} used to express these {{historical}} dimensions. A more traditional historical approach is to analyse {{the transformation of the}} globe’s ecology through themes like the separation of man from nature during the neolithic revolution, imperialism and colonial expansion, exploration, agricultural change, the effects of the industrial and technological revolution, and urban expansion. More environmental topics include human impact through influences on forestry, fire, climate change, sustainability and so on. According to Paul Warde, “the increasingly sophisticated history of colonization and migration can take on an <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect,</b> tracing the pathways of ideas and species around the globe and indeed is bringing about an increased use of such analogies and ‘colonial’ understandings of processes within European history.” The importance of the colonial enterprise in Africa, the Caribbean and Indian Ocean has been detailed by Richard Grove. Much of the literature consists of case-studies targeted at the global, national and local levels.|$|E
