She lived henceforth in complete retirement, residing chiefly at Chiswick House, where she turned to piety for consolation. Her contacts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> were chiefly her children and step-children, her brother William, {{and the children of}} her sister Georgiana. She survived her husband by fifteen years, dying on 25 November 1862 of a stroke at her London home at 13 Hereford Street.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

He outgrew the suit and never used the replacement one provided for him by NASA.|$|E
25|$|Born as {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, Drusilla grew up on Paradise Island along with her older sister, Princess Diana. After her sister left the island, she quickly became the finest archer and rider of the Amazons. When Hippolyta felt {{it was time for}} her elder daughter to return to the island, Drusilla was sent to America to urge her return. Reluctant to leave, Diana decided to show her younger sister of the need for Wonder Woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> As part of this she convinced Drusilla to pose as Diana Prince's teenage sister for a few days. During this time she accompanied General Blankenship on a car trip. They were attacked by Nazi spies who abducted the general and left her behind. Unable to contact her sister, she decided to go after the spies herself and transformed into Wonder Girl.|$|E
25|$|Adam Branson : Adam is Tender's older twin brother. Because {{he was the}} firstborn, Adam got {{to stay in the}} Church {{community}} in Nebraska and marry, while Tender was among those sent to earn a living for the Church <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal seems to be to completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the caseworker and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends a dashboard figurine (of Tender) into Adam's eye. Adam forces Tender to beat him with a rock, thereby killing him.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo {{reproduction}} {{is similar to}} that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo (the red kangaroo) the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.|$|E

500|$|According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close {{identification}} with Czech nationalism and the tragic {{circumstances of his}} last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland [...] "monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged" [...] by the Czech authorities, even {{as late as the}} last part of the 20th century. As a result, Tyrrell claims, a view of Czech music has been propagated that downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors such as Dvořák, Janáček, Josef Suk and other, lesser known, composers. This is at odds with perceptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> where Dvořák is far more frequently played and much better known. Harold Schonberg observes that [...] "Smetana was the one who founded Czech music, but Antonín Dvořák... was the one who popularized it." ...|$|E
500|$|The first verse of {{the song}} has the singer {{infatuated}} with the woman, admiring her inner strength. The three remaining verses reflect the inauthentic chaos that the singer {{has to deal with}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> from which the lover's Zen-like calm provides needed refuge. The final image is of the lover being like some raven at the singer's window with a broken wing. This image recalls Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Raven", but is also a symbol of the lover's vulnerability in spite of her strength. The broken wing may also be a reference to the woman's need for shelter, or else to a flaw in her. The style {{of the song}}'s lyrics are comparable to William Blake's poem, [...] "The Sick Rose", in their economy of language and use of a detached tone to express the narrator's intense emotional experience. The song's surreal images anticipate the psychedelic songs Dylan would later write.|$|E
