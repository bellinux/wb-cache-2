40|$|Non {{magnetic}} <b>foundry</b> <b>materials</b> {{such as the}} {{austenitic stainless}} cast steel had not been used for abrasion resistant materials, because their hardnesses were very low. Usually, ceramics, cermets and cemented carbides are used for the abrasion resistant materials {{even though they are}} expensive compared with <b>foundry</b> <b>materials.</b> In this study, WC powder were inserted by using the austenitic stainless cast steel (JIS SCS 13 A) and the austenitic cast iron (JIS FCA-NiCr 202) for producing surface hardened non magnetic materials. The melting temperature (pouring temperature) is lower in the austenitic cast iron than in the austenitic stainless cast steel while the fluidity of the melts is superior in the austenitic cast iron. For the WC powder inserted specimens, the hardness, the abrasion resistance and the magnetic property were examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was much higher than that of base metals of the cast steel and the cast iron, and that the magnetic permeability did not change by the inserting. Especially, a lot of WC powder was found to dissolve into the base metal in the cast steel than in the cast iron. In the case of the cast steel, Fe 3 W 3 C compound phase having high hardness of HV 800 was formed in the region of inserted WC powder. The hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was higher in the cast steel than in the cast iron, because the cast steel contained a lot of chromium compared with the cast iron...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The article {{presents}} {{one of the}} most advantageous trends of the development in the world power industry: wind power stations. One third of the weight of the installations in the wind power stations consists of castings. Since the year 2006 an increase in the demand for such cast-ings, and, consequently, an increase in the chances of the European and Polish foundries is fore-seen. The Enterprise METALODLEW S. A. (Joint Stock Company) in Kraków as the main element of its development strategy assumed an increase in the production of large-sized, technologically advanced castings made in high quality <b>foundry</b> <b>materials</b> and designed chiefly for export. Among this group of castings are castings of parts for wind power stations. A challenge for META-LODLEW and the scientific circles in Kraków, with whom this enterprise co-operates, was an order for a casting of a platform for the wind power station of the type N- 60 according to the strictly determined acceptance requirements, quality inspection and anticorrosion protection. The authors of the article presented the characteristics of the above-mentioned casting of the platform and the preparatory work connected with the realisation of this order for the wind power station of the type N- 60. Finally, the obtained mechanical properties of this casting which allow its applica-tion under extreme static and dynamic loads and low temperature were given.

40|$|Silica sand for foundry use is {{inexpensive}} to purchase, readily transported {{and widely}} available. As a result, it is universally used. However, three factors {{are becoming increasingly}} significant as more environmental regulations are promulgated. First, the disposal of waste foundry sand has become an excessively burdensome cost. Second, the phase changes which occur in the silica structure on heating and cooling cause thermal breakdown of the sand into smaller unusable fractions. Third, silica is a relatively weak mineral. Alternatives to silica sand which can withstand the rigors of repetitive reuse must be seriously evaluated {{as a way to}} control production costs of the domestic metal casting industry. Chromite sands, olivine sands and carbon sands have each been successfully used to solve operating problems and thus have developed their specific niches in the <b>foundry</b> <b>materials</b> inventory. However, there are several other materials that are candidates for replacing silica sand, such as fused alumina, sintered bauxite and sintered oil well proppants. These media, and others that are generically similar, are manufactured for specific purposes. Compositions and shapes could be readily tailored for used in a metal casting environment of total recycling and materials conservation. This study examines materials that are readily available as alternatives to silica sand from a functionality perspective and a cost perspective. Some of the alternative materials are natural and others are synthetic and thus referring to them as ``sands`` has the potential to cause confusion; the generic term ``granular medium`` is used in this study to mean any material that could functionally substitute for silica sand in the foundry process...|$|E

The foundry produced 12400 t of wastes in year 2002, made of the following materials: several types of muds and dusts coming from dust abatement plants (28. 7 %), furnace and ladle slags (21 %), aluminium shavings (21 %), machinery emulsions (9. 8 %), exhaust moulds and cores (4. 7 %), various materials packing (4 %), refractory material from furnaces (3. 5 %), saline solutions containing phosphates (3. 5 %), wastewater treatment mud (1. 6 %) and other materials (1. 7 %).

Design/methodology/approach: The selected method of numerical modelling enables 3 D fully dimensional numerical simulation of steel casting and the subsequent solidification of steel with the possibility of prediction of ingot defects. Findings: The numerical modelling of casting and solidification of the 90 ton heavy steel ingot under different boundary conditions of the casting led to these main conclusions: In all simulated variants, the final character of solidification was very similar. The lowest level of porosities were achieved in the variant when we used the longer filling time together with decrease of casting temperatures. However, the tested adjustment of casting technology appeared to have only small impact on the resulting porosity. Practical implications: The change of geometry of the mould will have probably more effect on the character of the solidification than only the small changes of the casting parameters which are dependent on the steel grade.

40|$|Natural materials, such as bone, {{integrate}} {{living cells}} composed of organic molecules together with inorganic components. This enables combinations of functionalities, such as mechanical {{strength and the}} ability to regenerate and remodel, which are not present in existing synthetic materials. Taking a cue from nature, we propose that engineered ‘living functional materials’ and ‘living materials synthesis platforms’ that incorporate both living systems and inorganic components could transform the performance and the manufacturing of materials. As a proof-of-concept, we recently demonstrated that synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli enabled biofilms to be both a functional material in its own right and a materials-synthesis platform. To demonstrate the former, we engineered E. coli biofilms into a chemical-inducer-responsive electrical switch. To demonstrate the latter, we engineered E. coli biofilms to dynamically organize biotic-abiotic materials across multiple length scales, template gold nanorods, gold nanowires, and metal/semiconductor heterostructures, and synthesize semiconductor nanoparticles (Chen, A. Y. et al. (2014) Synthesis and patterning of tunable multiscale materials with engineered cells. Nat. Mater. 13, 515 – 523.). Thus, tools from synthetic biology, such as those for artificial gene regulation, can be used to engineer the spatiotemporal characteristics of living systems and to interface living systems with inorganic materials. Such hybrids can possess novel properties enabled by living cells while retaining desirable functionalities of inorganic systems. These systems, as living functional materials and as living <b>materials</b> <b>foundries,</b> would provide a radically different paradigm of materials performance and synthesis–materials possessing multifunctional, self-healing, adaptable, and evolvable properties that are created and organized in a distributed, bottom-up, autonomously assembled, and environmentally sustainable manner.
