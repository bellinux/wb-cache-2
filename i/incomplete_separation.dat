40|$|ABSTRACT Spindle assembly, {{establishment}} of kinetochore attachment, and sister chromatid separation must occur during mitosis {{in a highly}} coordinated fashion to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. In most vertebrate cells, the nuclear envelope must break down to allow interaction between microtubules of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochores. It was previously shown that nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) is not coordinated with centrosome separation and that centrosome separation can be either complete {{at the time of}} NEB or can be completed after NEB. In this study, we investigated whether the timing of centrosome separation affects subsequent mitotic events such as {{establishment of}} kinetochore attachment or chromosome segregation. We used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate kinetochore attachment and chromosome segregation in cells with complete versus <b>incomplete</b> spindle pole <b>separation</b> at NEB. We found that cells with <b>incomplete</b> spindle pole <b>separation</b> exhibit higher rates of kinetochore misattachments and chromosome missegregation than cells that complete centrosome separation before NEB.

His method (2) when repeated with 10 gin. lots concentrated the luciferin from 15 to 30 times. His last method (3) was less successful {{because most of the}} luciferin was extracted from the final benzene solution or oxidized, by the recommended washing with "large amounts " of water. By making use of this extractability of luciferin from benzene solutions or residues by 0. 5 ~ hydrochloric acid instead of water, particularly in the presence of small amounts of ethyl alcohol, and the 10 or 20 to 1 distribution ratio of luciferin between N-butyl alcohol and the acid, preparations 200 or 300 times as active as the initial dry Cypridina were obtained. Results were similar when the luciferin was precipitated from the dilute acid solutions, alcohol free, with an excess of flavianic acid. However, losses from oxidation and <b>incomplete</b> <b>separations</b> were large. Also, although Kanda considered the benzene solubility as good support for his suggestion that luciferin is a phospholipid, it would go into benzene only under limited conditions and much of the behavior indicated that other materials present played an important part both in the transfer into and out of benzene. 1 1 For instance when a benzene solution was shaken with an equal volume of HCI, no alcohol being present, {{less than half of the}} luciferin transferred to the HC 1 during a few minutes of shaking. However, when once in the HC 1 no appreciable quantities have ever been found to transfer back from it into pure benzene.

40|$|We do {{not know}} how or why {{multicellularity}} evolved. We used the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt.

50|$|During {{embryonic}} development, twins {{can form}} from the splitting {{of a single}} embryo (monozygotic)which forms identical twins or the twins can arise from separate oocytes in the same menstrual cycle (dizygotic) which forms fraternal twins. Although the latter is more frequent, monozygotic is the reason conjoined twins can develop. In monozygotic twinning for conjoined twins such as ischiopagi, the twins form by the splitting of a bi-laminar embryonic disc after {{the formation of the}} inner cell masses. Thus, making the twins occupy the same amnion which can lead to a conjoining of the twins {{as a result of the}} twins not separating properly during the twinning process. Separation occurring between the seventh and thirteenth days should result in a monochorionic, monoamniotic identical twins sharing a yolk sac. If separation of the twins occur in the later stages of development prior to the appearance of the primitive streak and axial orientation, then it can be predicted that conjoined twins will develop. The origin of exactly what goes wrong to produce ischiopagus or any conjoined twin is a result by either incomplete fission or double overlapping inducing centers on the same germ disc. Various studies suggest that mechanical disturbances such as shaking of the blastomeres, exposure of the embryo to cold or insufficient oxygen during the early process of cleavage, grafting organizer onto gastrula or half a gastrula together, or constricting the blastula or early gastrula can cause the <b>incomplete</b> <b>separation</b> of monozygotic twins. However, studies have shown that these disturbances must happen at critical times in the pregnancy for the conjoined twins to develop.|$|E
50|$|There are broad generalizations {{relating}} to amphibians {{that can be}} used to describe their digestive processes. One such generalization is that digestion raises metabolic rate in the organism in which it is occurring. This wide idea will apply to T. carnifex. Digestion results in a hypertrophy (swelling) of the gastrointestinal regions. This is similar to the shunting of blood flow to the gastrointestinal compartments, as seen in muscular exercise. Both activities place a specific demand on the cardio-respiratory system. However, the similarities end at the surface and underlying mechanisms between the two processes differ. While muscular activity increases heart rate by vagal release, the digestive processes act directly on the heart and involve both non-adrenergenic and non-cholinergic factors. Digestion is demonstrated by an increase of the concentration of HCO3 in the blood. Since this shift is towards the lower (and more acidic) end of the pH scale, there is a countering mechanism in the increase of CO2 pressure in order to reduce the pH shift in the arterioles. This another example of regulation as opposed to conformation in the Italian crested newt. The high metabolic activity is caused by the digestion after feeding and more specifically the absorption of nutrients into the body and the utilisation of those nutrients. The height of metabolic change is directly proportional to how much food is consumed by the newt. There will also be an increase in heart rate post-feeding. An important note regarding the heart of the newt is that it possesses an <b>incomplete</b> <b>separation</b> between the two sides. This is not ideal, as it makes it possible for oxygen rich blood and oxygen poor blood to mix. The mixing of these two differing compositions would create problems in the arterial blood/gas composition, such as the decrease and reduction of the metabolic rate which is sustainable at the maximum level. Because of this, the physiology of newts attempts to avoid mixing.|$|E
