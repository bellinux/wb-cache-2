25|$|The program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for students to develop an appreciation for different cultures and promotes greater understanding. They {{can learn a lot}} by asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are learning it in class. If not, a simple PowerPoint with basic background information including geography, language, food, music, dance, sports, holidays, weather, and celebrations is sufficient. The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

Furthermore, it was contended that this damage constituted a threat to {{public health and safety}} and the MBTA would suffer irreparable harm <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were allowed to present; that the students converted and trespassed on MBTA property; that the students illegally profited from their activities; and that MIT itself was negligent in supervising the undergraduates and notifying the MBTA.|$|E

The students find themselves taken to the remote tropical Jabberwock Island by their alleged teacher, a small, rabbit-like mascot named Usami, who claims {{it to be a}} simple field trip. However, things turn out to be {{too good to be true}} as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get away with it. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but if they make the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E

25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E

The Forbidden Zones are randomly chosen areas of the map that increase in number as time goes on, re-sculpting and shrinking the battlefield and forcing the students to move around. The collars secretly transmit sound back to {{the organizers of the}} game, allowing them to hear the students' conversations, root out escape plans, and log their activities. The collars will explode <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> go a full day without anyone dying.|$|E

2500|$|Charles Goetzinger {{conducted}} an experiment using the mere-exposure {{effect on his}} class at Oregon State University. Goetzinger had a student come to class in a large black bag with only his feet visible. The black bag sat {{on a table in}} the back of the classroom. Goetzinger's experiment was to observe <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> would treat the black bag in accordance to Zajonc's mere-exposure effect. His hypothesis was confirmed. The students in the class first treated the black bag with hostility, which over time turned into curiosity, and eventually friendship. This experiment confirms Zajonc's mere-exposure effect, by simply presenting the black bag over and over again to the students their attitudes were changed, or as Zajonc states [...] "mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it".|$|E
2500|$|King's {{best known}} program is its Foundation Year Programme (FYP) for first year students, an {{intensive}} survey course of history, philosophy, and {{literature in the}} western tradition.

A Bachelor of Journalism program is offered as either a four-year honours degree or an intensive one-year program to students already holding a bachelor's degree. King's College and Dalhousie University also jointly offer a 10-month Master of Journalism program [...] and a two-year limited residency Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Nonfiction program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternative}} learning {{systems in}} the Philippines caters {{to the needs of}} the following: elementary and secondary school dropouts, kids that are older than the normal age for a specific grade level (this may be a 12 year old in grade 4), unemployed adults that haven’t finished their education degree, indigenous people, people with disabilities or are mentally challenged, and inmates. [...] It is possible to have both informal and formal references for these alternative learning systems because these are apart from the formal teaching institutions. Although similarly to the formal teaching institutions, there will be a diagnostic test for everyone that will participate in order to gauge the level they are at in terms of the skills needed per grade level. If there are people that do not have the basic skills such as reading and writing there will be an additional program that will help them first learn the basics before taking the diagnostic test. There will be a specific number of hours that is required of the student in order for him/her to be able to finish the program. There will be a final assessment to test the comprehensive knowledge of the student. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> passes he/she will be given a certificate that is signed by the secretary of the department of education allowing the student to apply for college degrees, work, formal training programs, and can re-enroll in elementary/secondary education in formal teaching institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Deployment of {{the main}} canopy for {{students}} in an AFF program is generally 6000 ft AGL (one mile or 1600 m), down to 5000ft AGL on later levels. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> experiences trouble in the deployment of their parachute, the instructors first use hand signals to remind <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to [...] "Pull". <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> still experiences trouble, the instructors will assist their student by physically putting <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> hand on <b>the</b> pilot chute, but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> still has trouble, the instructor will deploy for <b>the</b> <b>student.</b> <b>The</b> instructor may pull <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> main canopy at any time <b>the</b> <b>student</b> {{appears to be in}} danger.

2500|$|Felix Weil {{was one of}} the {{students}} who received their doctorate on the concept of socialization from the University of Frankfurt. [...] He, along with Max Horkheimer and Kurt Albert Gerlach, developed the Institute of Social Research and it was established in 1923. Kurt Albert Gerlach would serve as the institute’s first director. Their goal in creating the institute was to produce a place that people could discover and be informed of social life as a whole. Weil, Horkheimer, and Gerlach wanted to focus on interactions between economics, politics, legal matters, as well as scholarly interactions in the community and society. The main research that got the institute known was its revival of scientific Marxism. Many benefactors contributed money, supplies, and buildings to keep this area of research going. When Gerlach, became ill and had to step down as director, Max Horkheimer took his place. He encouraged {{the students}} of the institute to question everything they studied. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> studied a theory, he not only wanted them to discover its truth themselves, but also to discover how, and why it is true and the theories relation to society. The National Socialist regime exiled many {{of the members of the}} Institute of Social Research. The regime also forced many students and staff from the entire Frankfurt University, and most fled to America. Many people forced from the institute also left the war path, but unlike the university, the institute lost too many people and was forced to close. In 1950, the institute was reopened as a private establishment. From this point on the Institute of Social Research would have a close connection to sociology studies in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Chester Community Charter School is {{a charter}} school {{established}} in 1998 that serves over 2,000 students in grades K-8. [...] It is currently run by Steven Lee. New school Chester Charter School for the Arts was established in 2012 and currently house 460 children K-9 (adding on until 12). In 2017, New building will be established on Highland Ave. Widener Partnership Charter School was first launched in 2006, and is currently located across from the main campus university of Widener. It has been operating for eight years, and now has four hundred enrolled students from kindergartener to eighth grade. The university of Widener provides numerous support options to the charter school including educating staff, providing work to there graduate students, {{and use of the}} university facilities to help further the education of the charter school. The school also has a number of outside partners that include 21st Century Learning Communities, Andrew Hicks Foundation, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Big Friends, Chester Education Foundation, Earth Force, Exelon Foundation, Incredible Years, PECO, and Soccer for Success. Widener Partnership Charter School also has been proven to be efficient in helping children gain scholarships, and academic awards. Twenty Five eighth graders that graduated from the first class received scholarships to Philadelphia Catholic high schools, and where also given 100,000 dollars to attend Widener as undergraduate students <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> meet the requirements through high school. This marked the first graduating class of a university partnered charter school. Other news involving the charter school includes the new principle April Thomas who replaced Dr. Darlene Davis. She was the former assistant principle, and has a positive relationship with the students parents, and school community. Thomas currently holds master's degrees in reading and educational leadership from Arcadia University and a bachelor's degree in sociology from Millersville University. She has been in this position since February 27 of 2014. The Widener Partnership Charter School also has a number of after school programs. the Widener Cares Tutoring Project is a program dedicated to connecting Widener students, faculty, and staff volunteers with the elementary school students. They connect through the Freedom Baptist Church, The Nia Center, and the Unity Center. Widener Partnership Charter School also offers the Widener Reads and Widener Counts. This program is dedicated to students in Chester Community Charter School, Chester Upland School of the Arts, Drexel Neumann Academy, Stetser Elementary School and the Widener Partnership Charter School, and helps improve students reading skills through tutoring. The Widener Partnership Charter School also has recently added a new $4.6 million wing of the school at 1450 Edgmont Ave. This new edition includes a [...] Science Learning Center, an extension of the library, a gymnasium, eight classrooms and eight offices. The New wing was funded by the university, and the university charges the school rent on an annual basis, but no university tuition dollars or district reimbursement funds were put into the new wing of the school.|$|E

"It seems, young gentlemen, to be {{generally}} the custom in colleges, {{for the students}} to ornament the walls and benches of their recitation rooms, with various inscriptions and carricatures, so that after the premises have been for a short time in the possession of a class, every thing within reach, which will take an impression from a penknife, or a trace from a pencil, is covered with names, and dates, and heads, and inscriptions of every kind. The faculty do not know what you wish in this respect, in regard to the new accommodations which the Trustees have now provided for you, and which you are soon to enter. They have had them fitted up for you handsomely, and if you wish to have them kept in good order, we will assist you. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> think proper to express by a vote, or in any other way, their wish to keep them in good order, we will engage to have such incidental injuries, as may from time to time occur, immediately repaired.

60|$|The text-book, however good, and the lecturer, however able, {{are only}} one of two {{necessary}} factors in College work, the reciprocal element is the students' activity. Unless the students are actively engaged not simply in taking in what they are told, but in rearranging it, turning it over, trying and testing it, they are doing little good. We recognize this quite abundantly in the laboratory nowadays, but we neglect it enormously in the more theoretical study of a subject. The facts of a subject {{if it is a}} science may be got at in the most thorough way by handling in the laboratory, but the ideas of a subject must be handled in discussion, reproduction and dispute. Examinations, examinations by teachers who understand this very fine art, in which the student is obliged to restate, apply, and use the principles of his subject, are of the utmost value in keeping the mind active and not simply receptive. They are just as good and as vitally necessary as examination papers which merely demand definitions and lists and bald facts are bad. And then there might be discussions--if the Professor were clever enough to conduct them. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of a class could be induced to submit propositions for discussion, from which a topic could be selected, and could then be made to prepare for a disputation to which all would have to contribute, with the Professor as a controlling influence in the chair to check facts and logic and to conclude, it would have the value of a dozen lectures. But Professors who are under the burthen of perhaps ninety or a hundred lectures a year cannot be expected to do anything of this sort. Directed reading, conferences on knotty points, special lectures followed by the questioning of the lecturer, discussions upon matters of opinion, laboratory work when needful, fairly frequent test examinations, and a final examination for places, are the proper ingredients of a good modern College course, and in the necessity of leaving the Professor's energies free for the direction of all this really educational work, lies another reason for that complete, explicit, well-arranged text-book upon which I am insisting.|$|E
