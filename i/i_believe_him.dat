25|$|Foch {{was pleased}} at Wilson’s appointment, {{although}} Haig {{noted in his}} diary (25 February) that Wilson was no longer so keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig’s unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig’s attitude was “very stupid & short sighted but agreed we could not force Haig at this moment“. Wilson defended Haig’s position to the War Cabinet (6 March) and blamed Clemenceau and Petain (both of whom disliked Foch) and wrote in his diary that the British government {{had little choice but}} to back Haig “wrong as <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be”. At a SWC Meeting in London (14–15 March) Foch agreed under protest to shelve the Allied Reserve.|$|E
2500|$|I had the {{pleasure}} of meeting Raven Grimassi during the summer of 2001, unfortunately after the final draft of my article had already been submitted to The Pom. [...] He was very gracious and helpful to me. From information he revealed during our interview, I can say with reasonable certainty that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to have been initiated into a domestic tradition of folk magic and healing such as I describe in my article.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, O'Neal {{said that}} Bryant {{should have won}} the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which was awarded to Dirk Nowitzki. During the offseason, Bryant was [...] "beyond furious" [...] at reports from a Laker insider that Bryant had insisted O'Neal be traded from the Lakers. [...] Bryant {{reported}} that Buss said, [...] "I {{am not going to}} re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years ... His body is breaking down, and I don't want to pay that money to him when I can get value for him right now rather than wait ... It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay , period." [...] O'Neal agreed with Bryant: [...] "There's {{no doubt in my mind}} Kobe is telling the truth. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> a thousand percent ... I would have respected Dr. Buss more as a man if he would have told me that himself, because I know he said it." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> quite <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> now; and, in <b>believing,</b> <b>I</b> honoured <b>him</b> with a {{sincerity of}} esteem which made my heart ache.|$|R
60|$|Stroeve stopped {{again and}} mopped his face. I kept quite still. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> now, and <b>I</b> was astounded. But {{all the same}} I could not understand.|$|R
2500|$|Notable {{critics of}} the {{experiments}} include psychologists Dr. David Marks and Dr. Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977. Their 1978 article in Nature and 1980 book The Psychology of the Psychic (2nd ed. 2000) described how a normal explanation was possible for Geller's alleged psychic powers. Marks and Kammann found evidence that while at SRI, Geller was allowed to peek {{through a hole in}} the laboratory wall separating Geller from the drawings he was being invited to reproduce. The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the peep hole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the high importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics. Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller's paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that [...] "Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be a very clever, well-practiced magician." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} help it; <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him.</b> My own {{judgment}} seemed suddenly to rise up and ask me why I should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as <b>I</b> too <b>believed</b> in <b>him.</b> For <b>I</b> {{absolutely}} did, Maggie." [...] To which Fanny then added: [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>him</b> yet. <b>I</b> mean," [...] she subjoined--"well, I mean I DO." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know nothing}} myself. He {{talked to me}} about his affairs once, but he was such a liar that not a word that he said was worth anything. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> then. How it will go, I can't say.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I?" [...] he laughed. [...] "I am not bitter against him. Only <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be a {{man without}} heart or {{conscience}} or principles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Selina, I've {{told you}} before that such was not the case. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be {{perfectly}} worthy of me, and of any one much my superior too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a {{liar and}} a blackguard, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be a swindler," [...] said Sir Harry. Then Lady Elizabeth was mute, and her husband left her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} troubled {{by a strong}} {{impression}} that Casimer is not what he seems. Till he denied it on his honor <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> to be Baron Palsdorf. Did he speak the truth {{when he said he}} was not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, but Noureddin {{has just}} been {{to tell me that}} his father has changed his mind and has {{bestowed}} me upon <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him,</b> and so great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willingly pass my life with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|My face {{must have}} shown <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> utterly; yet my hands--but {{it was for}} pure tenderness--shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all for nothing, he had {{condemned}} me to months of torment. [...] "What then did you do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, with a {{fluttering}} breath, [...] "I {{have thought it}} out, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him.</b> I--" [...] She tried to say something more, but could not.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{believed}} {{him to be}} guilty," [...] she said, resolutely, [...] "I should not have the courage. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be innocent. Lead the way, Lady Lundie, {{as soon as you}} please." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE [soothing her]. Of course <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him,</b> dearest. But {{you should}} have broken it to me by degrees. [Drawing {{her back to her}} seat]. Now tell me all about him. Are you in love with him? ...|$|E
60|$|No, <b>I</b> don't. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> like <b>him.</b> Yet it's almost unbelievable. I've {{always thought}} men so detestable.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Garvey," [...] said Coltrane; [...] "the man {{you sold}} out to. There's no doubt but he's {{considerably}} cracked. I {{had to send}} him up for moonshining once, several years ago, {{in spite of the}} fact that <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> irresponsible. Why, what's the matter, Yancey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} I hesitated, {{and then walked}} slowly across the yard and opened the door. [...] "Sir William," [...] I said, as I did so, [...] "I {{travelled}} here with a companion dressed as a man; and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> to be what he seemed till this minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I aye {{thought the}} Doctor {{was a man}} till this moment," [...] said Luckie Simson; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> now to be an auld wife, little baulder than mysell; and I dinna wonder that poor Mrs. Gray"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] she said, [...] "I {{should tell}} you that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be the special envoy from New York to The Hague, or {{whatever}} place on the Continent this coming conference is to be held at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for {{not having}} done it earlier. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be Lady Catherine's nephew. It will be {{in my power to}} assure him that her ladyship was quite well {{yesterday}} se'nnight." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. No: {{it was not}} that. <b>I</b> didn't <b>believe</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> {{only wish}} I could.|$|R
5000|$|When I was {{at school}} a teacher {{told me the}} most {{beautiful}} word in the English language was cellar door—and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him,</b> even though it's strictly two words, and I made it mine. Many years later, I discovered the word he meant was [...] "celador". It's still my favorite.|$|R
60|$|This {{reference}} to Mr. Allen, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> frightened <b>him.</b> For a second {{only did he}} show it.|$|R
6000|$|I {{addressed}} her solemnly: [...] "David and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be utterly depraved. He availed {{himself of}} the first moments of his liberation to kiss Alice." [...] Aunt Martha {{looked at me with}} wide-open eyes, and then her brows contracted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't worry, Captain," [...] {{he remarked}} coolly. [...] "I am not taking too many chances, and if our friend Mr. Jocelyn Thew should {{turn out to}} be the man <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be, I would rather tackle him alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was MY room. His was opposite. He {{told me so}} when I {{first saw}} the sketch. I am the girl you speak of, for he knew no other, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> {{to have been a}} truthful, honorable man." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{did as he}} thus commanded; but {{my heart}} was lighter {{than at any time}} since we entered this prison-like hiding-place, for the belief was strong in my mind that if worse came to worse, and Master Lord was indeed the treacherous villain <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him,</b> we might be able to escape, so far as leaving the cellar was concerned.|$|R
60|$|Darius {{would have}} it that the traitor had not been seriously hurt by the blow on the head; but when he failed to show any signs of {{consciousness}} after we stowed him away in the hold, I grew alarmed, and, calling on Jim Freeman for assistance, set about trying {{to bring him to}} life, for of a verity <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "He went away--with a look {{as though}} he were heartbroken. He crept away slowly, saying that he was the most wretched soul alive. For a minute <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him,</b> and could almost have called him back; but no, Fanny, do not think that I am over proud, or {{conceited}} about my conquest. He had not reached the gate before he was thanking God for his escape." ...|$|R
