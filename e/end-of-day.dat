[...] David Thomson of The New Republic remarked that [...] "The most bracing and liberating thing about Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer is not just its lyrical forward motion, but the exuberance with which the film revels in its plot predicament."

[...] In relation to the declining music industry, Joseph Jaffe of Brandweek commented that such [...] "mysterious marketing measures [...] are what's desperately needed to gain attention in this uncertain era of distribution dilemmas and sagging sales", also commending acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead for being [...] "more innovative than marketers". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, comparing it to The X-Files and calling it [...] "A sci-fi concept album whose <b>end-of-days,</b> paranoia-drenched story line has been disseminated via the Internet".

50|$|The high {{discipline}} {{required by}} the original practices often went by the wayside, causing some of these practices, such as those thought too rigid, to be deprecated or reduced, or even left unfinished, on individual sites.

Such a more relaxed schedule could avoid people feeling rushed to generate artificial stubs just to pass the <b>end-of-day</b> testing.

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV also highlighted the comparisons to [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", explaining that [...] "the director's cut of the video is a sexy mash-up of Spears doing what she does best: groping half-naked guys, giving the camera bedroom eyes and being sassy {{in a number of}} leather jackets and skintight bodysuits." [...] Chris Gayomali of Time stated that the video [...] "s sweaty, at times blinding, yet undeniably enjoyable, adopting many of its key elements from Britney's coming-of-age 'I'm a Slave 4 U.'"

500|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 73 out of 100 based on 11 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was positive in the review of Cannibal. Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like {{they came from the}} bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous <b>end-of-days</b> whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|R
