25|$|In Vienna {{he became}} {{acquainted with the}} {{classical}} instrumental style. In 1807 Giuliani began to publish compositions in the classical style. His concert tours took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe. Everywhere he went he was acclaimed for his virtuosity and musical taste. He achieved great success and became a musical celebrity, equal {{to the best of}} the many instrumentalists and composers who were active in the Austrian capital city {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Beauty {{witnesses}} {{the harsh}} punishment of a runaway slave, Prince Laurent, {{as he is}} bound to a wooden cross and the Captain whips <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> his muscular body, and later sees Tristan pulling a cart carrying Laurent in a penitential procession. Tristan begs Nicholas {{to be allowed to}} meet Beauty and they reunite in Nicholas' house. Beauty and Tristan copulate as Nicholas watches behind a one-way mirror. Suddenly, Arab soldiers raid the village and several naked slaves, including Beauty, Tristan and Laurent, are kidnapped. The book closes as they are sent across the sea to serve in the palace of the Sultan.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 {{he founded}} the Joseph Howe Initiative, to {{celebrate}} in 2004 the 200th birthday of Joseph Howe, Nova Scotia's greatest son. He performed as Joseph Howe on several occasions in 2004, including in a version of Howe's famous defence against a charge of seditious libel in 1835, and in a CBC-TV documentary on Howe. He also wrote a young adult's novel, Joe Howe to the Rescue, to introduce Howe to the young generation. In 2008 he appeared as Joseph Howe on many occasions for Democracy250, an initiative {{set up by the}} Province of Nova Scotia to celebrate the birth of Canadian democracy in Nova Scotia in 1758. These performances took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Nova Scotia, as well as to Ottawa, Boston and London UK.|$|E
25|$|Rusk's {{mountaineering}} career took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the West Coast of the United States, {{beginning in}} 1889 {{and continuing to}} 1930. He met many other people on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described {{him as one of}} the most expert and daring mountaineers in the West. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, he had very few accidents while climbing and often saved others from extreme danger. He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E
500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front of the mix, is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus comes around, though, he plays something entirely different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that almost seems to evoke the falling rain.|$|E

500|$|Johnston {{was based}} at the branch of the USGS in Menlo Park, California, but his work on volcanoes took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the Pacific Northwest region. When the first {{earthquakes}} shook Mount St. Helens on March 16, 1980, Johnston was nearby at the University of Washington, where he had pursued his doctorate. Intrigued by the possible advent of an eruption, Johnston contacted Stephen Malone, a professor of geology at the university. Malone had been his mentor when Johnston had worked at the San Juan complex in Colorado, and Johnston admired his work. Malone stated that he [...] "put him to work" [...] almost instantly, allowing Johnston to escort interested reporters to a place near the volcano. Johnston was the first geologist on the volcano, and soon became a leader within the USGS team, taking charge of monitoring of volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
500|$|Getzein's {{record for}} {{complete}} games {{is based in}} part on the customs of the 1880s. [...] In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era. [...] It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that {{he would be able to}} finish the game." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival at}} Cardiff Central railway station, Friday {{was arrested by}} the British Transport Police for having {{travelled}} from Reading with only a platform ticket. Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody {{and took him to}} Ninian Park to sign the contract. Despite the manner of Friday's arrival, and although he knew there [...] "had to be something wrong with him", the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase, describing the £28,000 transfer as [...] "an absolute steal". After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. [...] "Oh, Charlie", Andrews gushed, [...] "he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place". The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. [...] "Jimmy, you've only had him four days", he warned, sombrely: [...] "Give it a few months"...|$|E

500|$|After winning {{his second}} world title, he {{embarked}} on a European tour which took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the Continent. Robinson traveled with his flamingo-pink Cadillac, which caused quite a stir in Paris, and an entourage of 13 people, some included [...] "just for laughs". He was a hero in France due to his recent defeat of LaMotta—the French hated LaMotta for defeating Marcel Cerdan in 1949 and taking his championship belt (Cerdan {{died in a plane}} crash en route to a rematch with LaMotta). Robinson met President of France Vincent Auriol at a ceremony attended by France's social upper crust. During his fight in Berlin against Gerhard Hecht, Robinson was disqualified when he knocked his opponent with a punch to the kidney: a punch legal in the US, but not Europe. The fight was later declared a no-contest. In London, Robinson lost the world middleweight title to British boxer Randolph Turpin in a sensational bout. Three months later in a rematch in front of 60,000 fans at the Polo Grounds, he knocked Turpin out in ten rounds to recover the title. In that bout Robinson was leading on the cards but was cut by Turpin. With the fight in jeopardy, Robinson let loose on Turpin, knocking him down, then getting him to the ropes and unleashing a series of punches that caused the referee to stop the bout. Following Robinson's victory, residents of Harlem danced in the streets. In 1951, Robinson was named Ring Magazine's [...] "Fighter of the Year" [...] for the second time.|$|E
500|$|During the 2003–04 season, {{his fourth}} with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting {{for a record}} five teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four {{international}} pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French Winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: [...] "He destroyed us all... They were kicking <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien." [...] At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, {{he made his first}} team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called [...] "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.|$|E

In {{one of the few}} instances where medieval infantry stood up against cavalry charges, the disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry broke into the Frankish square several times. Despite this, the Franks did not break. The well-trained [...] Frank soldiers accomplished what was not thought possible at that time: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge. Paul Davis says the core of Charles's army was a professional infantry which was both highly disciplined and well motivated, [...] "having campaigned with <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe".

2500|$|In 1934, an {{anonymous}} editor expanded the compilation with [...] "Text and Commentary" [...] (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded {{edition of the}} twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on {{the coming of the}} anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical The Dearborn Independent. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, {{as well as on the}} internet.

2500|$|Zindler {{began his}} {{broadcasting}} career in 1943 {{as a part-time}} night radio disc jockey and spot news reporter at now defunct Houston radio station KATL-AM while working for his family's clothing store. Beginning in 1951, when he worked for KATL, he hosted The Roving Mike, a 30-minute radio program airing on Sundays that documented crime and {{the people involved in}} Houston. In 1950 Zindler became a reporter and cameraman for Southwest Film Production Company which produced the 6 P. M. news for KPRC-TV, but in 1954, he was fired by an executive who said he was [...] "too ugly" [...] to work in TV. Two years later, Zindler joined the Scripps Howard Houston Press to work part-time as a crime reporter and photographer. While working for the newspaper and his father's store, Zindler became dissatisfied with the retail business and in 1962 took a career detour to join the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He handled Civil Process for two years and then joined the Fugitive Squad where his work took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world to extradite fugitives.|$|E
2500|$|Just as the feud {{was about}} to reach its heated highlight, the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the World Wrestling Federation without informing booker Bill Watts of his decision. This meant that the {{federation}} was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in [...] "Master G" [...] (journeyman wrestler George Wells) to take JYD’s place but the feud between Reed and “Master G" [...] never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When [...] "General" [...] Skandor Akbar entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels, he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch {{with the understanding that}} it wasn’t actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed, he became incensed, in the storyline, stomped on the watch, and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar and his cronies came to ringside, which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd behind him as he told them he didn’t need back-up. When “Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack, Reed’s face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar’s army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, and Hercules. The two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against Kamala. He proved to be too much for Reed, beating <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left.|$|E
