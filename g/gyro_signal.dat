50|$|The term TVRO {{has been}} in use on ships since it was {{introduced}} in the 1980s. One early provider of equipment was SeaTel with its first generation of stabilized satellite antennas that was launched in 1985, the TV-at-Sea 8885 system. Until this time ships {{had not been able to}} receive television signals from satellites due to their rocking motion rendering reception impossible. The SeaTel antenna however was stabilized using electrically driven gyroscopes and thus made it possible to point to the satellite accurately enough, that is to within 2°, in order to receive a signal. The successful implementation of stabilised TVRO systems on ships immediately led to the development of maritime VSAT systems. The second generation of SeaTel TVRO systems came in 1994 and was the 2494 antenna, which got its <b>gyro</b> <b>signal</b> from the ship rather than its own gyros, improving accuracy and reducing maintenance.|$|E

A novel approach in the time-frequency domain for <b>gyro</b> <b>signal</b> characteristics analysis is proposed based on the empirical mode decomposition and Allan variance (EMDAV). The output signal of gyro is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) first, and then the decomposed signal is analyzed by AV algorithm.

The typical control scheme of the light source power employs an additional photodetector to detect the output power of the light source.

The spike pulse overlapping on the <b>gyro</b> <b>signal</b> denotes potentially the change of the light power and fiber loss. In the novel scheme, the spike pulse is extracted from the <b>gyro</b> <b>signal,</b> and is transformed into the square wave by the differential circuit.

The first step was to characterize the new HEL testbed at NPS. This included determination of natural frequencies and component models which were used to create a Matlab/Simulink model of the testbed. Adaptive filters using Filtered-X Least Mean Squares (FX-LMS) and Filtered-X Recursive Least Square (FX-RLS) were then implemented. Disturbance sources included narrowband mechanical vibration of the optical bench as well as broadband atmospheric turbulence (simulation only). A feedback controller with adaptive filter (or feedbacktype adaptive filter) was applied to a multi-rate video tracking loop, which required precise plant identification to prevent instabilities.

Aircraft spin drives the silicon pendulum of a gyro rotating at a high speed {{so that it can}} sense the transverse angular velocity of the rotating aircraft based on the gyroscopic precession principle when the aircraft has transverse rotation. In applications of the rotating aircraft single channel control system, such as damping in the attitude stabilization loop, the <b>gyro</b> <b>signal</b> must be kept in sync with the control signal. Therefore, the phase difference between both signals needs to be measured accurately.

On the basis of theoretical analysis, a dynamic simulation has been done for a case where the spin frequency is 15 Hz.

Velocity estimation is of importance for lunar rovers to autonomously navigate and successfully traverse on rough terrains.

Treating the lunar rover with passively compliant mechanisms as a series-parallel multi-body system, we can directly build the whole kinematics model based on closed velocity chain theory.

40|$|A Kalman filter {{approach}} for combining the outputs of {{an array of}} high-drift gyros to obtain a virtual lower-drift gyro has been known in the literature {{for more than a}} decade. The success of this approach depends on the correlations of the random drift components of the individual gyros. However, no method of estimating these correlations has appeared in the literature. This paper presents an algorithm for obtaining the statistical model for an array of gyros, including the cross-correlations of the individual random drift components. In order to obtain this model, a new statistic, called the “Allan covariance” between two gyros, is introduced. The gyro array model can be used to obtain the Kalman filter-based (KFB) virtual gyro. Instead, we consider a virtual gyro obtained by taking a linear combination of individual gyro outputs. The gyro array model is used to calculate the optimal coefficients, as well as to derive a formula for the drift of the resulting virtual gyro. The drift formula for the optimal linear combination (OLC) virtual gyro is identical to that previously derived for the KFB virtual gyro. Thus, a Kalman filter is not necessary to obtain a minimum drift virtual gyro. The theoretical results of this paper are demonstrated using simulated as well as experimental data.
