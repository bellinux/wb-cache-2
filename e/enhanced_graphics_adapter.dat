500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E
500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|E
