50|$|Groundwater banking is {{accomplished}} in two ways: through in-lieu and direct recharge. In-lieu recharge is storing water by utilizing surface water “in-lieu” of pumping groundwater, thereby storing {{an equal amount}} in the <b>groundwater</b> <b>basin.</b> In-lieu recharge is the renewable surface water used to irrigate the farmland in place of using regular groundwater. This is helping to save more groundwater because the water stays in the aquifer to be used later. Direct recharge is storing water by allowing it to percolate directly to storage in the <b>groundwater</b> <b>basin.</b> With direct recharge it floods an area so that water seeps through the ground {{to get to the}} aquifers. The water is then pumped out when there is more of a demand with the use of recovery wells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrology}} of karst aquifers {{has been}} of interest since early historic times with caves serving as water-carrying pathways. The modern period of karst hydrology {{can be said to}} have begun roughly in the 1960 s with the work of the International Hydrologic Decade and with the recognition of the relationship of cave exploration to <b>groundwater</b> <b>basins.</b> A theme for the 40 year period between the 25 th anniversary of the NSS and the present is the gradual melding of traditional hydrogeology, which does not work well in karst, and the contributions of cave explorers who have provided tremendous detail about the conduit systems in aquifers. Important {{progress has been made in}} techniques for water tracing in karst areas and in systematic mapping of karst <b>groundwater</b> <b>basins.</b> Qualitative studies have largely been replaced by quantitative measurements of spring flow and water chemistry. The current research front deals with the construction of flow models for karst aquifers...|$|R

40|$|Karstic <b>groundwater</b> <b>basins</b> are {{characterized}} by both point and diffuse recharge. This paper describes the hydrologic characteristics of point recharge and their influence on recharge estimation for four <b>groundwater</b> <b>basins.</b> Point recharge is highly transient and may occur in relatively short-time periods, yet is capable of recharging a large volume of water, even from a single extreme rainfall event. Preferential groundwater flows are observed in karst aquifers with local fresher water pockets of low salinity that develop around point recharge sources. Measurable fresh water plumes develop only when a large quantity of surface water enters the aquifer as a point recharge. In fresh water plumes, the difference in chloride concentrations in diffuse and point recharge zones decreases as the plumes become enriched through mixing. The relative contributions to total recharge from point sources using the measured gap between groundwater and rainwater chloride in the chloride vs. δ 18 O plot is not necessarily indicative of sinkholes not directly recharging the aquifer. In karst aquifers, recharge estimation methods based on groundwater age distribution; average annual rainfall and basin average chloride in the conventional chloride mass balance (CMB) method are questionable due to theoretical limitations and key assumptions of these methods not being met. In point recharge dominant <b>groundwater</b> <b>basins,</b> application of: watertable fluctuation, numerical groundwater modelling, Darcy flow calculation or water budget methods {{are more suitable for}} recharge estimation as they are independent of the particular mode of recharge. The duality of the recharge mechanism in karst aquifers suggests that modification to the CMB method may be required to include both point and diffuse recharge components...|$|R
