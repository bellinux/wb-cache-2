5000|$|An <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is a [...] "stretchable bandage used {{to create}} {{localized}} pressure". Elastic bandages are commonly used to treat muscle sprains and strains by reducing {{the flow of blood}} to a particular area by the application of even stable pressure which can restrict swelling at the place of injury. Elastic bandages are also used to treat bone fractures. Padding is applied to the fractured limb, then a splint (usually plaster) is applied. The <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is then applied to hold the splint in place and to protect it. This is a common technique for fractures which may swell, which would cause a cast to function improperly. These types of splints are usually removed after swelling has decreased and then a fiberglass or plaster cast can be applied.|$|E
50|$|An <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage,</b> {{rather than}} a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, non-elastic bandage will result in {{reduction}} of adequate blood flow, potentially causing ischemia. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood.|$|E
50|$|Class I devices present minimal {{potential}} for {{harm to the}} user and are often simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of early fitting in trans-tibial amputees. The {{assumption}} is that compared to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging,</b> {{the use of a}} rigid dressing in early fitting will result in quicker wound healing and earlier ambulation. A retrospective file search was carried out in three different hospitals, analysing the time to first prosthesis, the incidence of local and general complications and the functional outcome after discharge from hospital. Each of the hospitals used a different method of postoperative care: <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging,</b> immediate postoperative application of the plaster cast or delayed application of the plaster cast within one week post amputation. In comparison to the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging</b> method (N =  52), the use of a rigid dressing in the early fitting method (immediate and delayed, N =  97) resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (110 days vs 50 days) and a decreased risk of knee flexion contracture. Although, differences in local complications were not observed, the risk of pressure sores in other places than the stump was increased in early fitting. Instead of further reducing the time to first prosthesis by immediate fitting, the use of delayed fitting resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (56 vs 40 days). However, delayed fitting was associated with an increased risk for reamputation. In conclusion, this study indicates that early fitting by use of a rigid dressing after trans-tibial amputation is the treatment of choice. If it is possible to apply a plaster cast in the operating room, the authors would prefer the immediate fitting method...|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{possible}} with ice, cold compression therapy, wearing heel pads {{to reduce the}} strain on the tendon, and an exercise routine designed to strengthen the tendon (see eccentric strengthening, above). Some people have reported vast improvement after applying light to medium compression around ankles and lower calf by wearing <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> throughout the day. Using these <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> while sleeping can reduce morning stiffness but {{care must be taken}} to apply very light compression during sleep. Compression can inhibit healing by hindering circulation. Seeing a professional for treatment as soon as possible is important, because this injury can lead to an Achilles tendon rupture with continued overuse. Other treatments may include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, ultrasound therapy, manual therapy techniques, a rehabilitation program, and in rare cases, application of a plaster cast. Steroid injection is sometimes used, but must be done after very careful, expert consideration because it can increase the risk of tendon rupture. There has recently been some interest in the use of autologous blood injections; however the results have not been highly encouraging and there is little evidence for their use.|$|R
50|$|Protocols vary {{depending}} on local standard procedures and the extremity being operated on. A vast majority of practitioners begin by exsanguinating the limb as Bier did with an elastic bandage(Esmarch bandage), squeezing blood proximally toward the heart, then pneumatic tourniquets are then applied to the limb and inflated 30mmHg above arterial pressure to occlude all blood vessels and then the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> is removed. The local anesthetic, typically lidocaine(DOC) or prilocaine without adrenaline, is slowly injected as distally as possible into the exsanguinated limb. The veins are filled with the anesthetic and sets in after approximately 6-8 minutes, after which the surgery may begin. Analgesic effect remains for upto 2 hours.The wait time is important for avoiding toxic levels of anesthetics in the systemic bloodstream {{which can lead to}} hypotension convulsions and even death in extreme cases so, cardiotoxic LA like bupivacaine and etidocaine are strictly contraindicated.|$|E
5000|$|The Unna (sometimes called [...] "Unna's") Boot {{itself is}} a {{compression}} dressing, usually made of cotton, that contains zinc oxide paste. The zinc oxide paste in the Unna Boot helps ease skin irritation and keeps the area moist. The zinc promotes healing within wound sites, making it useful for burns and ulcers. Zinc oxide paste is superior to gelatins used in other dressings, {{because it does not}} harden or cake. Some Unna Boots also contain calamine lotion and glycerin. For venous stasis ulcers, the paste-impregnated wrap is covered by an elastic layer, generally an elastic wrap ("ACE" [...] bandage) or self-adherent <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> such as Coban; this is referred to as a 2-layer compression bandage. An alternative treatment is a 4-layer, graduated compression wrap (Pro-Fore is an example). Evidence indicates that both are equally effective in healing venous stasis ulcers — a slow process in the best of circumstances, often taking 2-6 months.|$|E
50|$|Pressure is preferably {{applied with}} an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> Alternatively it is {{possible}} to wrap much of the limb with an intact long-sleeved shirt, {{but it is difficult to}} apply an ideal even pressure with an inelastic fabric, and one shirt may not be long enough. Bandaging begins two to four inches above the bite (i.e. between the bite and the heart), winding around in overlapping turns and moving up towards the heart, then back down over the bite and past it towards the hand or foot. Then the limb must be held immobile: not used, and if possible held with a splint or sling. The bandage should be about as tight as when strapping a sprained ankle. It must not cut off blood flow, or even be uncomfortable; if it is uncomfortable, the person will unconsciously flex the limb, defeating the immobilisation portion of the therapy. The location of the bite should be clearly marked on the outside of the bandages. Some peripheral edema is an expected consequence of this process.|$|E
50|$|The use of elastic {{compression}} stockings can reduce volumetric variations during standing hours.

5000|$|Non-elastic, ambulatory, below knee (BK) {{compression}} counters {{the impact}} of reflux on venous pump failure. Compression therapy is used for venous leg ulcers and can decrease blood vessel diameter and pressure, which increases their effectiveness, preventing blood from flowing backwards. [...] Compression is also used [...] to decrease release of inflammatory cytokines, lower the amount of fluid leaking from capillaries and therefore prevent swelling, and prevent clotting by decreasing activation of thrombin and increasing that of plasmin.

40|$|In {{patients}} with leg ulcer and restricted mobility, compression with elastic material is often preferred {{based on the}} concept {{that it is more}} effective as it exerts a sustained higher resting pressure while inelastic material is believed to exert a very low resting pressure and to work only during movement. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate that elastic and inelastic material can exert similar pressure at rest and that inelastic material can produce a much higher pressure during sitting and light exercise in ulcer {{patients with}} restricted mobility. In 30 patients (12 men, 18 women mean age 76. 3 ± 9. 1 years, range 63 - 80) with leg ulcers and severely reduced mobility we applied consecutively <b>elastic</b> and inelastic <b>bandages</b> with the same resting pressure of 40 mmHg. Pressure changes were measured while the patient was sitting and standing and during active and passive muscle contractions. The pressure differences between standing and supine and sitting and supine position were calculated as well as between muscle systole and diastole during active and passive contractions. Starting with the same resting pressure inelastic bandages produce significantly higher pressure peaks in the sitting and standing position and during the muscular systole both during active and passive exercise compared to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> (P< 0. 001). The results show that inelastic bandages, applied with the same pressure as <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> at rest, will exert much higher pressures even during minimal or passively induced muscle contractions.

5000|$|The Italian grip, {{evolving}} {{from the}} handle of the rapier (Renaissance) and its later progeny, the smallsword (Baroque period), is rarely used today in sport fencing today, but is common among classical fencers. In the 1940s and 50s, it was very popular with sport fencers in America and many other countries, until being supplanted by the pistol grip. Its advocates say that it has most of the French grip's agility with a much greater degree of power and stability. The Italian grip consists of a straight handle, usually wood or aluminium covered in grip tape, as well as a crossbar (the quillions), and two rings. The fencer's fingers actually rest upon the ricasso, {{which is part of the}} blade. This not only gives great security, but great sensitivity. Because of the smaller length of the handle, and particulars of the Italian style of bladework, the Italian grip is used with a [...] "martingale" [...] which is either a leather strap around the wrist into which the pommel is tucked, or an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> which is wrapped completely around the hand.|$|E

Magni continued the race with his shoulder wrapped in an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> To compensate for his inability to apply force with his left arm, he raced while holding a piece of rubber inner tube attached to his handlebar between his teeth for extra leverage. Since his injury prevented him from effectively braking and steering with his left hand, Magni crashed again after hitting a ditch by the road during a descent on stage 16. He fell on his already broken clavicle, breaking his humerus, after which he passed out from the pain. They put him in an ambulance, but when Magni regained his senses and realized that he was being taken to the hospital he screamed and told the driver to stop. Magni took his bike and was able to finish the stage in the peloton, which had waited for him. Of the evening that followed Magni said [...] "I had no idea of how serious my condition was, I just knew that I was {{in a lot of pain}} but I didn't want to have X-rays that evening".

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} need to wear {{compression}} stockings for 4 weeks after inversion stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) from the groin {{to the level of}} the knee. DesignRandomised controlled trial. PatientsA total of 104 consecutive patients with primary complete incompetence of the GSV treated by inversion stripping of the GSV. MethodsPostoperatively treated limbs underwent <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging</b> for 3 days. Volunteers were randomised to wear a compression stocking for additional 4 weeks (intervention group) or no compression stocking (control group). The primary outcome was limb oedema as assessed by photoelectric leg volume measurement. Secondary outcome measures were pain scores, postoperative complications and return to full work. ResultsThe control leg volume was 3657 ml (standard deviation, SD 687) preoperatively and 3640 ml (SD 540) 4 weeks postoperatively (non significant, N. S.). The stocking leg volume was 3629 ml (SD 540) preoperatively, falling to 3534 ml (SD 543) (P< 0. 01) 4 weeks postoperatively. The difference in leg volume between both the groups was not statistically significant. Patients in the control group resumed work earlier (control 11 days, stocking 15 days, P= 0. 02, Mann–Whitney test). No difference was observed in the number and type of complication and in pain scores during the 4 -week follow-up period. ConclusionsWearing an elastic compression stocking has no additional benefit following <b>elastic</b> <b>bandaging</b> for 3 days in postoperative care after stripping of the great saphenous vein as assessed by control of limb oedema, pain, complications and return to work...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{compartment}} syndrome (ACoS) is a serious, limb-threatening condition, but ACoS after {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) is rare. ACoS is diagnosed {{with the help of}} typical symptoms, but due to the use of analgesics in a postoperative setting, these symptoms may vary. Identifying risk factors for ACoS after CABG could reduce the risk of developing this complication. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of five cases of ACoS arising from CABG procedures at our institution during the last 5 years. We also review all cases found in literature about this complication. Both systemic and local factors may contribute to ACoS of the lower leg. These factors include increased microvascular permeability caused by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the use of cardiac-assist devices causing arterial occlusion and reperfusion injury, diminished arterial blood flow in patients with peripheral vascular disease due to lithotomy position and the use of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> and local trauma and hematoma formation due to the harvesting of the greater saphenous vein (GSV). To prevent this serious complication, we advise to pay extra attention to the patients with a greater risk. Hemostasis after venectomy in CABG surgery is mandatory, especially in the endoscopic harvesting of the GSV. <b>Elastic</b> <b>bandages</b> should be applied after weaning from CPB.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} methods of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application in nursing practice. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} anatomy or venous and lymphatic system. It also focuses on examinations of venous and lymphatic system in which <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application {{is an integral part}} of the procedure. The thesis refers to roles of a nurse in <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application and to roles of bandage in nursing practice. Three objectives were set for the thesis. The first objective was to identify methods used by nurses in <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application. The second objective was to find out what information about <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> application is available to the nurses. The third objective was to propose input documents for development of a manual for practical application of <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> All the objectives set for the thesis have been met. The thesis establishes four hypotheses. The hypothesis No. 1 ``Nurses prefer ear-shaped turns in application of elastic bandage`` has been confirmed. The hypothesis No. 2 ``Nurses are able to explain the difference between short-stretch and long-stretch bandages`` has not been confirmed. The hypothesis No. 3 ``Nurses understand the potential complications from incorrect application of elastic bandage`` has been confirmed. The survey used a questionnaire containing 26 questions. The questionnaire contained closed, half-closed and open questions. The data were collected in March 2009 in the hospital in České Budějovice. 110 questionnaires were distributed in total and 98 questionnaires were returned. 5 questionnaires were eliminated due to incompleteness.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the RRD’s efficacy in decreasing stump edema and pain compared to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> for diabetic mellitus patients after transtibial amputation. Methods: Interventional research was using consecutive  sampling. Subjects were randomized into two groups: RRD and <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> Twenty-three subjects were analyzed. Stump  edema volume was measured by the amount of water spilled out from volume glass. <b>Elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> was reapplied every 4 hours  and RRD was refitted every 7 days during evaluation time. Stump edema volume was evaluated every 7 days during the 8 week observation. Results: There was a significant decrease of stump volume in RRD group during the first and second week (p = 0. 03, p = 0. 01) and the edema decreasing time was also significant (p = 0. 03).   The average decrease of edema volume in RRD was 63. 85 % of second week and in the <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> group was 34. 35 %. There were a tendency of pain reduction time in RRD group (4. 83 ± 1. 95 weeks) compared to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> group (5. 18 ± 2. 31 weeks). Cox regression result of decreasing edema volume time was 3. 088 (CI 95 %: 1. 128 – 4. 916).

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of the interventional limb raising management strategy (ILRMS) to <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> compression at radial vascular access sites following coronary angiographies (CAGs) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Methods: Patients with ischemic coronary heart disease whose condition was stable over three months were enrolled in this clinical study (n =  590; aged 25 – 80). All participants had just undergone CAG and PCI. Patients were randomized into either the ILRMS group (n =  360) or standard post-intervention care with an <b>elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> (n =  230). Overall comfort and wrist pain was assessed and the degree of index finger swelling and oxygen saturation was measured on the affected arm.
