25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy. These rapid changes in governments led to rapid policy changes and reversals and {{the reduction of}} transparency and accountability in government.

Political instability and macroeconomic imbalances have been reflected in poor creditworthiness ratings, even compared to other countries of similar income levels, with resulting capital flight and lower foreign direct investment inflows.

[...] On 30 June 1982, with {{approval from the}} Riksdag, the FMV issued contracts worth SEK 25.7 billion to Saab, covering five prototypes and an initial batch of 30 production aircraft. By January 1983, a Viggen was converted to a flying test aircraft for the JAS 39's intended avionics, such as the fly-by-wire controls.

500|$|The game began {{production}} {{alongside the}} company's second project, , and remained in development after that game's 1993 release. It then {{continued through the}} creation of their titles System Shock (released in 1994) and Flight Unlimited. The game was subject to numerous delays, which Schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline. He stated that the team was [...] "trying to go with the same philosophy" [...] as the company's earlier games, in that they would [...] "develop the systems and the game would come out of it". However, the team's <b>development</b> <b>priorities</b> regularly changed, and the programmer who led the project left several years into production. According to Schmidt, his departure meant that [...] "there was no-one left who was psyched about making this really [...] simulation". Despite this fact, the team continued using the idea, even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it. Schmidt said that the game's development status was uncertain after the programmer left, and that he inherited the role of lead programmer around that time merely because the position had to be filled. He later assumed the role of project leader. In January 1995, Looking Glass showed Terra Nova alongside Flight Unlimited at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their [...] "Immersive Reality" [...] marketing label.|$|E
2500|$|One of the Paris Declaration's {{priorities}} is {{to reduce}} systems of aid that are [...] "parallel" [...] to local systems. For example, Oxfam reported that, in Mozambique, donors are spending $350 {{million a year on}} 3,500 technical consultants, which is enough to hire 400,000 local civil servants, weakening local capacity. [...] Between 2005 and 2007, the number of parallel systems did fall, by about 10% in 33 countries. In order to improve coordination and reduce parallel systems, the Paris Declaration suggests that aid recipient countries lay down a set of national <b>development</b> <b>priorities</b> and that aid donors fit in with those plans.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, {{a version}} of Windows codenamed Blackcomb was planned as the {{successor}} to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed [...] "Longhorn," [...] was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three major viruses: the Blaster, Nachi, and Sobig worms, exploited flaws in Windows operating systems {{within a short time}} period in August 2003, Microsoft changed its <b>development</b> <b>priorities,</b> putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
