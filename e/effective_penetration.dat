In selective laser ablation of thin films, the precise control of the heat affected zone in the vertical direction becomes critical {{in order to avoid}} the damage of the substrate. For this application an <b>effective</b> thermal <b>penetration</b> depth can be defined determined by not only the optical penetration depth, but also the lattice thermal diffusion length in short pulse ablation or the hot- electron penetration depth in case of ultrashort laser ablation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 60 - 63) During {{the cold}} war, the United States intelligence community {{was focused on}} addressing a specific intelligence threat: spies. One of the ways U. S. intelligence agencies alleviated this threat was by penetrating the adversary's Foreign Intelligence Services. They learned {{that this was the}} most effective way in countering the threat. After September 11, the intelligence community focused on addressing a new threat: al-Qaida, a networked based terrorist organization. Traditional counterterrorism tools are insufficient in addressing the new threat. The U. S. government is willing to bring to bear every tool at its disposal including the penetration of terrorist organizations. This thesis compares the infiltration of terrorist organizations versus Foreign Intelligence Services. It also discusses why terrorist organizations are much more difficult to penetrate and which methods that were previously employed against Foreign Intelligence Services are ineffective. This will enable the reader to realize that penetrating terrorist organizations require a different mentality as well as a tailored approach.

50|$|Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) {{primarily}} {{in the form of}} lactic acid and glycolic acid are the most researched forms of AHAs because they have a molecular size that allows <b>effective</b> <b>penetration</b> into the top layers of skin. It is generally assumed that in and of themselves AHAs in concentrations of 4% to 15% are not effective for inhibiting melanin production and will not lighten skin discolorations in that manner. It is believed that their benefit is in helping cell turnover rates and removing unhealthy or abnormal layers of superficial skin cells (exfoliation) where hyperpigmented cells can accumulate. However, other research has shown that lactic and glycolic acids can indeed inhibit melanin production separate from their actions as an exfoliant on skin.|$|E

Scholars also use this theory to examine other factors influencing the social penetration process in close friendships. As Mitchell and William (1987) put it, ethnicity and sex do have impact on the friendship foster.

40|$|The {{significance}} of interior humidity in attaining sustainable, durable, healthy and comfortable buildings is increasingly recognised. Given their significant interaction, interior humidity appraisals need a qualitative and/or {{quantitative assessment of}} interior moisture buffering. While the <b>effective</b> moisture <b>penetration</b> depth and <b>effective</b> capacitance models allow quantified assessment, their reliance on the ‘moisture penetration depth’ necessitates comprehensive material properties and hampers their application to multidimensional interior objects. On the other hand, while various recently suggested protocols for the simple and fast measurement of the moisture buffer potential of interior elements allow qualitative assessment, none of these are currently dependable {{for a wide range}} of moisture production regimes. In response to these flaws, this paper introduces the production-adaptive characterisation of the moisture buffer potential of interior elements and corroborates their superposition toward a room-enclosure moisture buffer potential. It is verified that this enables qualitative comparison of enclosures in relation to interior moisture buffering. It is moreover demonstrated that it forms an alternative basis for quantitative evaluation of interior moisture buffering by the <b>effective</b> moisture <b>penetration</b> depth and <b>effective</b> capacitance models.

40|$|Three {{types of}} graphitic shelled-magnetic core (Fe, Fe/Co, and Co) {{nanoparticles}} (named as C-Fe, C-Fe/Co, and C-Co NPs) were synthesized by radio frequency-catalytic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (RF-cCVD). X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the cores inside the carbon shells of these NPs were preserved in their metallic states. Fluorescence microscopy images indicated <b>effective</b> <b>penetrations</b> of the NPs through the cellular membranes of cultured cancer HeLa cells, both inside the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Low RF radiation of 350 kHz induced localized heating of the magnetic NPs, which triggered cell death.

It was showed that the Fe-C NPs had a much higher ability of killing the cancer cells (over 99 %) compared with the other types of NPs (C-Co or C-Fe/Co), even at a very low concentration of 0. 83 μg/mL. The localized heating of NPs inside the cancer cells comes from the hysteresis heating and resistive heating through eddy currents generated under the RF radiation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} columnar defects in layered superconductors on the thermally activated penetration of pancake vortices through the surface barrier. Columnar defects, located near the surface, facilitate penetration of vortices through the surface barrier, by creating ``weak spots'', through which pancakes can penetrate into the superconductor. Penetration of a pancake mediated by an isolated column, located near the surface, is a two-stage process involving hopping from the surface to the column and the detachment from the column into the bulk; each stage is controlled by its own activation barrier. The resulting effective energy {{is equal to the}} maximum of those two barriers. For a given external field there exists an optimum location of the column for which the barriers for the both processes are equal and the reduction of the <b>effective</b> <b>penetration</b> barrier is maximal. At high fields the <b>effective</b> <b>penetration</b> field is approximately two times smaller than in unirradiated samples. We also estimate the suppression of the <b>effective</b> <b>penetration</b> field by column clusters. This mechanism provides further reduction of the penetration field at low temperatures.
