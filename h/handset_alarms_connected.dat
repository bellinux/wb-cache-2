In this paper we present a temporal segmentation technique based on significance testing, connected components analysis and mathematical morphology. We first derive the difference image between two consecutive images of a video sequence and form a histogram. The image noise, which is assumed to follow a zero-mean Gaussian distribution, is therefore reflected in the histogram and we use a fitting technique to find the variance of this noise. We obtain change detection thresholds based on suitable false <b>alarm</b> probabilities. <b>Connected</b> components analysis is then utilized to remove any residual noise, and the morphological close operator is applied to obtain the segmentation mask.

5000|$|Initially {{the police}} did not {{consider}} the fire suspicious. Questions arose {{about whether or not}} the fire alarms could be heard in the lobby of the Holiday Inn when firefighters arrived. While hotel officials said the alarms were functioning, firefighters first at the scene said they were unable to hear the bells. Although the building met existing fire codes, it lacked some fire prevention equipment including no smoke detectors, no sprinkler system, the fire <b>alarm</b> system wasn't <b>connected</b> to the Greece-Ridge Fire Department or other security agency, and there was only one vertical fire wall between the two wings. The alarm system consisted only of one bell in the middle of each of the two wings. [...] An expert fire investigator named John Stickevers was brought in from New York City to assist with the investigation. He discovered that an uncommon highly flammable accelerant was used to start the fire in the form of a liquid which was ignited inside a storage cupboard under the first floor stairwell. The fire was officially ruled as an arson attack. No one was ever charged with this crime. The case remains open today. In early 2011, the Greece Police Department launched the most intensive investigation of the fire in the last thirty years. On November 26, 2014, police announced that they have identified a suspect for the first time. This comes almost 36 years following the deadly fire.|$|R
40|$|Experienced staffs acquire their {{experience}} during {{many years of}} practice, and sometimes also through expensive mistakes. This knowledge is often lost when technicians retire, or if companies need to downsize during periods of reduced sale. When scaling up production, new staff requires training and may repeat similar mistakes. Another issue that may be costly is when monitoring systems repeatedly give false alarms, causing expensive loss of production capacity and resulting in technicians losing trust in the systems and in worst case, switch them off. If monitoring systems could learn from previous experience for both correct and false alarms, the reliability and trust in the monitoring systems would increase. Moreover, <b>connecting</b> <b>alarms</b> to either equipment taking automatic actions or recommend actions based on the current situations and previous experience would be valuable. An engineer repeating the same task a second time is often able to perform the task in 1 / 3 {{of the time it}} took at the first time.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} three diagnostic methods {{for use with}} industrial processes. They are measurement validation, i. e., consistency checking of sensor and measurement values using any redundancy of instrumentation; alarm analysis, i. e., analysis of multiple alarm situations to find which <b>alarms</b> are directly <b>connected</b> to primary faults and which alarms are consequential effects of the primary ones; and fault diagnosis, i. e., {{a search for the}} causes of and remedies for faults. The three methods use multilevel flow models (MFM), to describe the target process. They have been implemented in the real-time expert system tool G 2, in C, and in Common Lisp, and successfully tested on simulations of several processes. The knowledge representation ontology used is based on the notion of flows, of mass, energy, and information, which are used to describe physical systems. The relationships between structure and function of a system is described by teleological relations, which connect the flow structures into a graph, built at model construction time. This allows the diagnostic reasoning to be implemented as searches in a static graph structure, and it can thus be performed extremely rapidly. As with other model-based approaches, general algorithms are used over a representation with generative capacities. The representation gains strength from being functional with a very abstract physical level, more abstract than most qualitative physics models. It works well with systems that can be described using flows, while it currently lacks the capability of capturing important aspects of other types of systems, for example, electronic circuits...|$|R
40|$|Lack of time, lack of staff, unwillingness of nurses, poor {{communication}} and cooperation of nurses with family members, and non-satisfaction of a childs needs are the faults of nurses {{that affect their}} approach to the hospitalized children. These <b>alarming</b> facts are <b>connected</b> with hospitalization of children and, {{as a matter of}} course, influence the way a child feels in hospital, the way the parents look on hospitalization of their child, and the way the parents of a child regard the approach of nurses to their children during hospitalization in hospital. The objective of the thesis was to ascertain an opinion of a family member about the nurses approach to the hospitalized children, and whether family members approve or disapprove the nurses approach. The objective of the thesis has been attained. Three hypotheses were raised in the thesis. The first hypothesis ascertained whether a family member hospitalized with a child is more satisfied with the nurses approach than a family member not hospitalized with a child. This was the sole hypothesis that has not been confirmed. The second hypothesis was to confirm that family members were informed about the nursing care of the hospitalized child. This hypothesis has been confirmed and revealed that despite occurrence of {{communication and}} awareness faults the parents often show initiative so they have the information they want to know and they need. The third hypothesis was to verify whether family members of a child were satisfied with the nurses approach to the hospitalized child. The last hypothesis has also been confirmed. The data for the research were collected by means of a quantitative research. Family members were provided with anonymous questionnaires. The research set were family members of children hospitalized in hospitals Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s., Nemocnice Tábor, a. s. and in one of the hospitals in the capital city of Prague in the period from February to March 2010.
