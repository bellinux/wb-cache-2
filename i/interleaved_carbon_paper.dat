50|$|An Autographic Register is a {{business}} machine invented in 1883 by James C. Shoup. The device consisted two separate rolls of <b>paper</b> <b>interleaved</b> with <b>carbon</b> <b>paper.</b> Usually {{one or both of}} the rolls would be preprinted with form information. To operate the machine the user would write, for example, a sales receipt and the machine automatically produced a copy. The crank on the machine ejected the records and moved a blank form into view. The original receipt produced would go to the user and the copy was filed. Shoup founded the Autographic Register Company in Hoboken, NJ to manufacture his invention.|$|R

For example, if six extra {{copies of a}} letter were needed, the fluid-corrected {{original}} would be photocopied, but only for the two recipients getting [...] "c.c."s; the other four copies, the less-important file copies that stayed in various departments at the office, would be cheaper, hand-erased, less-distinct bond paper copies or even [...] "flimsies" [...] of different colors (tissue <b>papers</b> <b>interleaved</b> with black <b>carbon</b> <b>paper)</b> that were all typed as a [...] "carbon pack" [...] {{at the same time}} as the original.|$|R
5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain <b>paper</b> <b>interleaved</b> with <b>carbon</b> <b>paper.</b> The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the <b>carbon</b> or carbonless <b>paper</b> transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as an invoice to give to a customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure. The different copies can be on paper of different colour to distinguish them, and preprinted content may vary between copies.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{years before}} his death in 1989, Andrei Sakharov’s {{comments}} at a scientists’ forum helped begin the process for the elimination of thousands of nuclear ballistic missiles from the US and Soviet arsenals. Sakharov (1921-89) was recruited into the Soviet Union’s nuclear weapons program in 1948, a year after he completed his doctorate. In 1949 the US detected the first Soviet test of a fission bomb, and the two countries embarked on a desperate race to design a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb that was a thousand times more powerful. Like his US counterparts, Sakharov justified his H-bomb work by pointing to the danger of the other country’s achieving a monopoly. But also like some of the US scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, he felt a responsibility to inform his nation’s leadership and then the world about the dangers from nuclear weapons. Sakharov’s first attempt to influence policy was brought about by his concern about possible genetic damage from long-lived radioactive carbon-14 created in the atmosphere from nitrogen-14 by the enormous fluxes of neutrons released in H-bomb tests. In 1968 a friend suggested that Sakharov write an essay {{about the role of the}} intelligentsia in world affairs. Self-publishing was the method at the time for spreading unapproved manuscripts in the Soviet Union. Many readers would create multiple copies by typing with multiple sheets of <b>paper</b> <b>interleaved</b> with <b>carbon</b> <b>paper.</b> One copy of Sakharov’s essay, “Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom,” was smuggled out of the Soviet Union and published by the New York Times. More than 18 million reprints were produced during 1968-69. After the essay was published, Sakharov was barred from returning to work in the nuclear weapons program and took a research position in Moscow. In 1980, after an interview with the New York Times in which he denounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the government put him beyond the reach of Western media by exiling him and his wife to Gorky. In March 1985 Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. More than a year and a half later, he persuaded the Politburo, the party’s executive committee, to allow Sakharov and Bonner to return to Moscow. Sakharov was elected as an opposition member to the Soviet Congress of People’s Deputies in 1989. Later that year he had a cardiac arrhythmia and died in his apartment. He left behind a draft of a new Soviet constitution that emphasized democracy and human rights.|$|R

Selective CNF growth on only one side of <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> is required to transfer the generated protons on platinum catalyst fast enough to avoid any proton mass transfer losses.
