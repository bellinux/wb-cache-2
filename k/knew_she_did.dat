500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> a lot of characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You {{have to believe that}} he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' â€“ and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E

60|$|She {{could not}} help it, {{that she was a}} traveller. She knew Anthony, that he was not one. But oh, {{ultimately}} and finally, she must go on and on, seeking the goal that she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> draw nearer to.|$|E
60|$|I. Mas. The reason is, {{because you}} <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not regard you enough to appear, if you awaked her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{speaking}} now {{of all of}} you," [...] said Nanda. [...] "But {{it was she who}} {{was most}} so, for <b>she</b> tried--I <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> told me so--to control you. And it was when, you were most controlled--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, perhaps I {{blame her}} wrongly. She {{may have some}} little good faith--a woman has, here and there. How <b>do</b> you <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not love Ladywell?' ...|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{kissed the}} pearls--I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not do it}} on account of any love for them--and tears came into her eyes. I believe she had long waited to receive this gift, in the precise {{character}} {{in which it was}} now received.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{belonged to}} you, Coppy," [...] said Wee Willie Winkie, {{indicating}} Miss Allardyce with a grimy forefinger. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> n't {{ought to go}} acwoss ve wiver, and I knew ve wegiment would come to me if I sent Jack home." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took her}} leave of her {{mistress}} and returned home. She {{was glad to}} be on the station with a crowd of Saturday-night people, glad to sit in the lighted, crowded railway carriage. Only {{she did not want to}} meet anybody she <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not want to talk. She was alone, immune.|$|E
50|$|At {{school the}} next day, Buffy and Willow talk again about their future. Buffy <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> can not leave Sunnydale; Willow now <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not want to leave}} because {{fighting}} evil and studying Wicca are what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do.</b> Both will attend UC Sunnydale.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she's {{going to}} stay here. I <b>know</b> <b>she's</b> <b>doing</b> it {{for the sake of}} those blessed cats, {{although}} she says it's too much trouble to open her own house, and she hates visiting." ...|$|R
60|$|How should her ladyship <b>know?</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> {{not marry}} Doctor Tusher {{until she was}} {{advanced}} in life. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not become Madame de Bernstein until still later. Old Dido, a poet remarks, was not ignorant of misfortune, and hence learned to have compassion on the wretched.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} nice of you, Rose," [...] she said, and they walked off together. She talked about the flowers in the grass, and Rose ran to and fro, {{climbing}} fences to pick all sorts that she <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not laugh when the teacher told her the botanical names. She wished she could remember them.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{in spite}} of all, she perversely hoped. If he would only make any sign, the least in the world, that he was sorry--that he still loved her--she could forgive him everything. When he drove away without another word, she could not believe it again. Surely he would not go--surely he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not mean it--he would turn back before {{he got to the}} gate.|$|E
60|$|She {{did what}} she knew, and then sat biting {{the top of her}} pen till her aunt came back, and there was a change in occupations all round, {{resulting}} in her having to read French aloud, which she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> well; but it was provoking to find that Gillian read quite as well, and knew a word at which she had made a shot, and a wrong one.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{this young}} couple can not {{cope with their}} {{responsibilities}} and begin to have a painful separation. Ana knows that only time and maturity of the can save, but also <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have much time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> but <b>she</b> won't let me relieve her, {{even for}} an hour. It isn't because she doesn't trust me; she says it's because she doesn't want me sitting there--so--publicly. She doesn't oppose my {{housekeeping}} any more--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What a bad {{disposition}} you have, Peggotty!' returned my mother. 'You are as {{jealous of}} Miss Murdstone {{as it is}} possible for a ridiculous creature to be. You want to keep the keys yourself, and give out all the things, I suppose? I shouldn't be surprised if you did. When you <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> only <b>does</b> it out of kindness and the best intentions! You <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> Peggotty--you <b>know</b> it well.' ...|$|R
60|$|Here I must explain, if I {{have not}} done so already, that she had graciously {{informed}} me that notwithstanding my refusal in past years of such a priceless opportunity, I also was {{to be allowed to}} bathe my superannuated self in the vital fires, though in what guise I should emerge from them, like Herodotus when he treats of the mysteries of old Egypt, if she <b>knew,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not think it lawful to reveal.|$|E
60|$|We {{were going}} {{now to the}} Villa Mandragone, but we had not yet the courage for the rise of ground where we had failed before, and we entreated our driver to go round some other way, if he could, and descend rather than ascend to it. He said that was easy, and it was when we came away that we passed through that ilex avenue which we had not yet {{penetrated}} in its whole length, and where we now met many foot-passengers, lay and cleric, who added {{to the character of}} the scene, and saw again the little cripple artist, now trying to seize its features, or some of them. I did not see whether she was succeeding so well as in pity she might and as I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A white night," [...] Dick Forrest surmised for his guest's benefit, {{and went}} into details {{additional}} to Bert's of her constitutional inaptitude for normal sleep. [...] "Do you know, we were married years before I ever saw her sleep. I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> sleep, but I never saw her. I've seen her go three days and nights without closing an eye and keep sweet and cheerful all the time, {{and when she did}} sleep, it was out of exhaustion. That was when the All Away went ashore in the Carolines and the whole population worked to get us off. It wasn't the danger, for there wasn't any. It was the noise. Also, it was the excitement. She was too busy living. And when it was almost all over, I actually saw her asleep {{for the first time in}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the thrice-accursed telephone," [...] Ah Kim muttered, {{while she}} {{suspended}} the stick to catch what he said. [...] "Mrs. Chang Lucy told you. I <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> I saw her see me. I shall have the telephone taken out. It {{is of the}} devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{name had}} a magical {{influence}} over her. When others uttered it <b>she</b> changed countenance--I <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> pronounced it {{herself in the}} most musical of her many musical tones. She was cordial to me; she {{took an interest in}} me; she was anxious about me; she wished me well; she sought, she seized every opportunity to benefit me. I considered, paused, watched, weighed, wondered. I could come to but one conclusion--this is love.|$|R

60|$|Gerald {{had used}} money {{belonging}} {{to the bank and}} borrowed from Hallam in order to pay it back; although Thorn could not see what had persuaded the latter to lend. It was strange, certainly, that Hallam had inquired about Askew, but in the meantime he could let this go. Gerald was threatened by a danger money could avert, and Thorn could help. If he did help, it would give him a claim to Osborn's gratitude, although he could not tell how far this would influence Grace. The Osborns cherished the old-fashioned traditions of their class, and anything that touched one touched all. Grace, however, was modern and rebellious, and Thorn <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not like him much. He was not afraid to risk his money, but he must not waste an opportunity he might not get again, and the opportunity could be used in one of two ways.|$|E
60|$|It was a wet evening, {{and when}} the tables were drawn the guests devoted {{themselves}} to various amusements. Lord Salisbury challenged Sir Patrick to a game at chess, Lady Salisbury and Dame Lilias wished for {{nothing better than to}} converse over old times at Middleham Castle; but the younger people began with dancing, the Duke, who was only thirty years old, leading out the elder Scottish princess, and the young King of the Isle of Wight the stately and beautiful Duchess Cicely. Eleanor, who <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not excel in anything that required grace, and was, besides, a good deal fatigued, would fain have excused herself when paired with the young Richard Nevil; but there was a masterful look about him that somewhat daunted her, and she obeyed his summons, though without acquitting herself with anything approaching to the dexterity of her sister, who, with quite as little practice as herself, danced well--by quickness of eye and foot, and that natural elegance of movement which belongs to symmetry.|$|E
60|$|There were {{no means}} of knowing whether the brig came round, about this time, or not. Agreeably {{to the rule of}} chasing, she should have tacked when {{directly}} abeam, unless she fancied she could eat us out of the wind by standing on. We <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not tack when directly abeam, but we could not see whether she came round after us, or not. At all events, tack or not, she must still be near a league under our lee; and we drove on, towards the English coast, until the day reappeared, not a man of us all sleeping a wink that night. How anxiously we watched the ocean astern, and to leeward, as the returning light slowly raised the veil of obscurity from before us! Nothing was in sight, even when the sun appeared, to bathe the entire ocean in a flood of glory. Not even a white speck in-shore; and as for the brig, we never saw or heard more of her. Doubtless she stood on, on the old course, hoping gradually to close with us, or to draw so far ahead and to windward, as to make certain of her prey in the morning.|$|E
60|$|This, as all {{visitors}} to the place <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> for that monument remains to this day, representing the old knight lying in the snow, with the arrow in his throat, between the two murderers whom he slew, while round {{the corner of the}} tomb Jeffrey Stokes gallops away.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the weight}} deepened {{and her heart}} grew tense to bear it. Her {{breathing}} was laboured. But this weight also she could bear. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> without looking that the horses were moving nearer. What were they? She felt the thud of their heavy hoofs on the ground. What was it that was drawing near her, what weight oppressing her heart? <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not look.|$|R
50|$|In March 2005, {{she became}} Minister of Jerusalem Affairs in the Palestinian National Authority, in the {{government}} formed shortly after the election of Mahmoud Abbas to the presidency. Little <b>known,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not succeed in the legislative elections of January 2006. She was later sent to France {{as a representative of}} Palestine.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her steadfastly, and asked her many things about Ralph, Mrs. Cliff, and the negroes, and what had {{happened}} since he left San Francisco. He listened with a questioning intentness as she spoke. She spoke rapidly and concisely as she answered his questions and asked him about himself. She said little about the gold. One might have supposed that he had arrived at Marseilles with a cargo of coffee. At the same time, there seemed to be, on Edna's part, a desire to lengthen out her recital of unimportant matters. She now saw that the captain <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not care to talk of these things. She {{knew that he was}} waiting for an opportunity to turn the conversation into another channel,--waiting with an earnestness that was growing more and more apparent,--and as she perceived this, and as she steadily talked to him, she assured herself, with all the vehemence of which her nature was capable, that she and this man were two people connected by business interests, and that she was ready to discuss that business in a business way as soon as he could speak. But still she did not yet give him the chance to speak.|$|E
6000|$|The {{arguments}} he had {{so carefully}} rehearsed were all forgotten; nothing left but an incoherent pleading. Life without her was not life; and they had only one life for love--one summer. It was all dark where she was not--the very sun itself was dark. Better to die than to live such false, broken lives, apart from each other. Better to die at once than to live wanting each other, longing and longing, and watching each other's sorrow. And all {{for the sake of}} what? It maddened, killed him, to think of that man touching her when he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> but hate him. It shamed all manhood; it could not be good to help such things to be. A vow when the spirit of it was gone was only superstition; it was wicked to waste one's life for the sake of that. Society--she knew, she must know--only cared for the forms, the outsides of things. And what did it matter what Society thought? It had no soul, no feeling, nothing. And if it were said they ought to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, to make things happier in the world, she must know that was only true when love was light and selfish; but not when people loved as they did, with all their hearts and souls, so that they would die for each other any minute, so that without each other there was no meaning in anything. It would not help a single soul, for them to murder their love and all the happiness of their lives; to go on in a sort of living death. Even if it were wrong, he would rather do that wrong, and take the consequences! But it was not, it COULD not be wrong, when they felt like that! ...|$|E
