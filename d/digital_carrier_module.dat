50|$|The {{creative}} process in traditional and digital painting {{is more or}} less the same, but when the digital artist is done, there is nothing to hang on a wall. The painting is on the hard disk of a computer. The usual way to make it presentable and salable is to project it on a traditional carrier, such as paper, canvas or polyester. This is commonly done by a professional printer. For an original painting, the traditional physical <b>carrier</b> substitutes the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier,</b> which is deleted. For a series, the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> is deleted when the prefixed number of copies has been reached. For an open ended series, the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> is retained on the computer.|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail {{is a novel}} propellantless space propulsion concept. According to numerical estimates, the electric solar wind sail can produce a large total impulse per propulsion system mass. Here we consider using a 0. 5 N electric solar wind sail for boosting a 550 kg spacecraft to Uranus in less than 6 years. The spacecraft is a stack consisting of the electric solar wind sail module which is jettisoned roughly at Saturn distance, a <b>carrier</b> <b>module</b> and a probe for Uranus atmospheric entry. The <b>carrier</b> <b>module</b> has a chemical propulsion ability for orbital corrections and it uses its antenna for picking up the probe’s data transmission and later relaying it to Earth. The scientific output of the mission is similar to what the Galileo Probe did at Jupiter. Measurements of the chemical and isotope composition of the Uranian atmosphere can give key constraints to different formation theories of the Solar System. A similar method could also be applied to other giant planets and Titan by using a fleet of more or less identical probes...|$|R
50|$|Before the <b>digital</b> T-1 system, <b>carrier</b> wave {{systems such}} as 12-channel carrier systems worked by {{frequency}} division multiplexing; each call was an analog signal. A T-1 trunk could transmit 24 telephone calls at a time, because it used a <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> signal called <b>Digital</b> Signal 1 (DS-1). DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit. T-1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the benefits and costs of aeronautical research and technology (ABC-ART) models are documented. These models were developed by NASA for use in analyzing the economic feasibility of applying advanced aeronautical technology to future civil aircraft. The methodology is composed of three major modules: fleet accounting module, airframe manufacturing <b>module,</b> and air <b>carrier</b> <b>module.</b> The fleet accounting module is used to estimate {{the number of new}} aircraft required as a function of time to meet demand. This estimation is based primarily upon the expected retirement age of existing aircraft and the expected change in revenue passenger miles demanded. Fuel consumption estimates are also generated by this module. The airframe manufacturer module is used to analyze the feasibility of the manufacturing the new aircraft demanded. The module includes logic for production scheduling and estimating manufacturing costs. For a series of aircraft selling prices, a cash flow analysis is performed and a rate of return on investment is calculated. The air <b>carrier</b> <b>module</b> provides a tool for analyzing the financial feasibility of an airline purchasing and operating the new aircraft. This module includes a methodology for computing the air carrier direct and indirect operating costs, performing a cash flow analysis, and estimating the internal rate of return on investment for a set of aircraft purchase prices...|$|R

40|$|A {{digital signal}} {{processor}} and processing method therefor for use in receivers of the NAVSTAR/GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) employs a <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> down-converter, <b>digital</b> code correlator and digital tracking processor. The <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> down-converter and code correlator consists of an all-digital, minimum bit implementation that utilizes digital chip and phase advancers, providing exceptional control and accuracy in feedback phase and in feedback delay. Roundoff and commensurability errors {{can be reduced to}} extremely small values (e. g., less than 100 nanochips and 100 nanocycles roundoff errors and 0. 1 millichip and 1 millicycle commensurability errors). The digital tracking processor bases the fast feedback for phase and for group delay in the C/A, P. sub. 1, and P. sub. 2 channels on the L. sub. 1 C/A carrier phase thereby maintaining lock at lower signal-to-noise ratios, reducing errors in feedback delays, reducing the frequency of cycle slips and in some cases obviating the need for quadrature processing in the P channels. Simple and reliable methods are employed for data bit synchronization, data bit removal and cycle counting. Improved precision in averaged output delay values is provided by carrier-aided data-compression techniques. The signal processor employs purely digital operations in the sense that exactly the same carrier phase and group delay measurements are obtained, to the last decimal place, every time the same sampled data (i. e., exactly the same bits) are processed...|$|R
2500|$|When loading coils are in place, signal {{attenuation}} remains low for signals within the passband of {{the transmission line}} but increases rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. Thus, if the pair is subsequently reused to support applications that require higher frequencies (such as analog or <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> systems or DSL), any loading coils that were present on the line must be removed or replaced with ones which are transparent to DSL. [...] Using coils with parallel capacitors will form a filter with the topology of an m-derived filter and a band of frequencies above the cut-off will also be passed.|$|R
