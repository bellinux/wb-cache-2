40|$|Drying {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods of {{preserving}} food. Primitive societies practiced the drying of meat and fish in the sun long before recorded history. Today the drying of foods is still important as a method of preservation [1]. Drying is traditionally defined as that unit operation which converts a liquid, solid or semi solid feed material into a solid product of significantly lower moisture content. It is a complex process involving simultaneous coupled, transient heat, mass and momentum transport [2]. Food drying also involves simultaneous mass and energy transport phenomena [3]. Dried foods can be stored for long periods without deterioration occurring. The principal reasons for this are that the microorganisms which cause food spoilage and decay are unable to grow and multiply in the absence of sufficient water and many of the enzymes which promote undesired changes in the chemical composition of the food cannot function without water [1]. There are two general processes of drying; <b>adiabatic</b> and non-adiabatic <b>drying</b> processes. The <b>adiabatic</b> dryers involve a drying gas that provides the heat of vaporization and later carries the vapor away from the product. The non-adiabatic dryers involve heat flows into the solids from sources other than the drying gas, e. g. radiation or conduction by contact with a surface [4]. There are several ways to classify the drying methods. Drying methods can be subdivided by the way in which heat is supplied to the moist material and by the mod...|$|R

40|$|Air drying {{of paper}} by pure impingement, pure through flow and by {{combination}} of impingement and through flow was studied. For the combined process the inlet and both outlet air flow rates were held constant throughout drying, thereby providing results appropriate {{for analysis of}} the complex and interacting kinetics. Pure impingement drying rate curves were quantified with three parameters which were related to drying process conditions: constant drying rate, critical moisture content and the exponent for a power law relationship over the falling rate period. The Churchill - Usagi asymptotic approach model was tested and found not applicable. For pure through drying the constant drying rate period disappears at higher drying intensities leaving two drying rate periods, the increasing rate and falling rate periods. A theoretically based exponential relationship was obtained for the increasing rate period, where up to 47 % of the drying may occur. Drying rate curves were quantified with no subjective judgements, using five parameters: moisture contents {{at the end of}} the increasing rate and constant rate periods, constant drying rate, and exponents for the increasing and falling rate period relations. A universal normalized drying rate curve was obtained. Through drying rates are the same with or without impinging jets. In combined impingement and through air <b>drying,</b> an <b>adiabatic</b> process, removal of impingement boundary layer humidity by through flow makes both components of the process nonadiabatic. Relative to pure impingement drying, impingement water removal rates are sensitively reduced by through flow. Because critical moisture content is intrinsically lower for through drying than impingement drying, through flow water removal rate curves can be strikingly different from pure through drying, with addition of a unique feature, a secondary increasing rate period when paper temperature is driven up by the falling rate period of impingement water removal. Parameters for quantitative representation were determined, analyzed and related to drying process conditions. Of two prior models for the combined impingement and through air drying of paper, trends assumed by Randall (1984) are now found contrary to actual rates while the Crotogino and Allenger (1979) model has the trends correct but over predicts the drying rates now measured.

Analytical solutions of the gamma-distribution type are found using an analogy and methodology from quantum mechanics. In particular, formulas are derived for {{the index of}} the gamma distribution p and the relative dispersion of the droplet size spectra, which determines the rate of precipitation formation and cloud optical properties. An important feature of these solutions is that, although the equation for p includes many parameters that vary by several orders of magnitude, the expression for p leads to a dimensionless quantity of the order 1 – 10 {{for a wide variety}} of cloud types, and the relative dispersion sr is related directly to the meteorological factors (vertical velocity, turbulence coefficient, <b>dry</b> and moist <b>adiabatic</b> temperature lapse rates) and the prop-erties of the cloud (droplet concentration and mean radius). The following observed behavior of the cloud size spectra is explained quantitatively by the analytical solutions: narrowing of drop size spectra with increased cooling rate, and broadening of drop size spectra with increasing turbulence. The application of these solutions is illustrated using an example of a typical stratus cloud and possible applications for the convective clouds are discussed. The predictions of this solution are compared with some other models and with observations in stratus and convective clouds.

Spinacea oleracea and Tetragonia tetragonioides plants were grown in containers 11 x 11 cm large in mixture of garden substrate A with silicon sand (2 : 1) in 2 variations placed in FAPPZ greenhouses. One variation was for control and second was exposed to stress reaction. Control variation had been watered for whole time of experiment with 50 ml of water 2 times per week.

With usage of burnt calorimetry method had been monitored capacity of photosynteticaly accumulated energy in dry mass. Quantity of netto energy had been found out by <b>dry</b> burning <b>adiabatic</b> calorimeter LAGEST MS 10 A. From the gained results emerge, that plants of Tetragonia tetragonioides have 2 times higher weight growth apart from Spinacea oleracea. Control plants of Tetragonia tetragonioides have higher weight by 25, 5 % (123 mg) compared to the plants growing in water deficit. Likewise higher weight of roots had been observed on control plants (41 mg) compared to the stressed plants (40 g). Control spinach plants had higher weight of above-ground biomass by 19, 5 % compared to the stressed ones (43 mg). Roots of control plants had lower weight compared to stressed variant by 2960 mg.

5000|$|The {{difference}} in moist {{adiabatic lapse rate}} and the dry rate {{is the cause of}} foehn wind phenomenon (also known as [...] "Chinook winds" [...] in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> lapse rate, until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the adiabatic lapse rate decreases to the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> lapse rate. Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.|$|E
50|$|The {{convective}} {{condensation level}} (CCL) results when strong surface heating causes buoyant lifting of surface air and subsequent mixing of the planetary boundary layer, {{so that the}} layer near the surface ends up with a <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> lapse rate.
