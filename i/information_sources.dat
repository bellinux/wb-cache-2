To different extents, these actors may shape research and development (R&amp;D) investments, affect success of the innovation process and contribute directly {{as well as through}} the innovation process to the labour productivity. Effects of these simultaneous practices on the innovation process are investigated in service sector firms, which have so far been largely neglected in (open) innovation studies.

30|$|When {{people use}} the Internet to search for health information, they are {{permanently}} at risk of encountering misinformation. Information seekers deal with this threat by evaluating {{the credibility of the}} provided information and the trustworthiness of the <b>information</b> <b>source.</b> To make such evaluations, information seekers ask themselves whether the <b>information</b> <b>source</b> is an expert in his field and whether the <b>information</b> <b>source</b> bases his argumentation on scientific studies (see Previous research). In the present article, we argue that these information evaluation strategies are often not sufficient in real-world situations. In a first step, we present a theoretical scenario in which an <b>information</b> <b>source</b> has a conflict of interest that should lead to lower credibility and trustworthiness judgements, even if the <b>information</b> <b>source</b> is an expert in his field and bases his argumentation on scientific studies. Furthermore, we argue that this conflict of interest should also decrease the perceived instructional qualities of the <b>information</b> <b>source</b> (see Problem statement). In a second step, we discuss the results of an experimental study that was designed to test our hypotheses in an online learning setting in which different hosts of online video lectures - with and without conflicts of interest - argued that organic food is superior to conventional food (see Method, Results, & Discussion).|$|R
