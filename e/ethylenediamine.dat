5|$|The {{production}} of <b>ethylenediamine</b> dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with <b>ethylenediamine</b> and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethylenediamine,</b> {{because it}} {{contains}} two amine groups, is a widely used precursor to various polymers. Condensates derived from formaldehyde are plasticizers. It is widely used {{in the production of}} polyurethane fibers. The PAMAM class of dendrimers are derived from <b>ethylenediamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chiral analogues of <b>ethylenediamine</b> include 1,2-diaminopropane and trans-diaminocyclohexane.|$|E
25|$|Related {{derivatives}} of <b>ethylenediamine</b> include tetramethylethylenediamine (abbreviated TMEDA), (CH3)2N-CH2CH2-N(CH3)2 and tetraethylethylenediamine (abbreviated TEEDA) (C2H5)2N-CH2CH2-N(C2H5)2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethylenediamine</b> (abbreviated as en when a ligand) is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C2H4(NH2)2. This colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor is a strongly basic amine. It {{is a widely}} used building block in chemical synthesis, with approximately 500,000 tonnes produced in 1998. <b>Ethylenediamine</b> readily reacts with moisture in humid air to produce a corrosive, toxic and irritating mist, to which even short exposures can cause serious damage to health (see safety).|$|E
25|$|Consider the two equilibria, in aqueous solution, {{between the}} copper(II) ion, Cu2+ and <b>ethylenediamine</b> (en) {{on the one}} hand and methylamine, MeNH2 on the other.|$|E
25|$|The {{bleaching}} activator tetraacetylethylenediamine {{is generated}} from <b>ethylenediamine.</b> The derivative N,N-ethylenebis(stearamide) (EBS) is a commercially significant mold-release agent and a surfactant in gasoline and motor oil.|$|E
25|$|Imidazole {{can also}} be formed in a vapor-phase {{reaction}}. The reaction occurs with formamide, <b>ethylenediamine,</b> and hydrogen over platinum on alumina, and it must take place between 340 and 480°C. This forms a very pure imidazole product.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethylenediamine</b> is used {{in large}} {{quantities}} for production of many industrial chemicals. It forms derivatives with carboxylic acids (including fatty acids), nitriles, alcohols (at elevated temperatures), alkylating agents, carbon disulfide, and aldehydes and ketones. Because of its bifunctional nature, having two amines, it readily forms heterocycles such as imidazolidines.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interesting}} alternative approach, Férey and coworkers {{were able to}} modify the interior of MIL-101 via Cr(III) coordination {{of one of the}} two available nitrogen atoms of each of several <b>ethylenediamine</b> molecules. The free non-coordinated ends of the ethylenediamines were then used as Brønsted basic catalysts, again for Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with nitriles.|$|E
25|$|Since {{liquid ammonia}} {{has to be}} {{condensed}} into the flask and has to evaporate overnight after the reaction is complete, the whole procedure can be quite troublesome and time-consuming. However, alternative solvents have been employed, such as THF {{as well as a}} mixture of n-propylamine and <b>ethylenediamine,</b> both with comparable results. The latter one actually is a modification of the Benkeser reaction, which in its original forms tends to reduce naphthalene all the way to octahydro- and decahydronaphthalene.|$|E
25|$|Remote {{burning of}} the {{explosive}}. Where possible, {{it is better to}} burn the explosive without detonation. Diethylene triamine (a close relative of <b>ethylenediamine)</b> reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation. It has been reported that this amine is hypergolic with TNT, Tetryl, Composition B and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or PETN-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. pyridine, diethylamine and pyrole) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Werner, a Nobel-prize winning {{pioneer in}} {{coordination}} chemistry, worked with compounds of empirical formula Cl3. One of the isomers determined was cobalt(III) hexammine chloride. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, {{consists of a}} central cobalt atom coordinated by six ammine orthogonal ligands and three chloride counteranions. Using chelating <b>ethylenediamine</b> ligands in place of ammonia gives tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride (Cl3), {{which was one of}} the first coordination complexes to be resolved into optical isomers. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a [...] "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ethylenediamine,</b> like ammonia {{and other}} low-molecular weight amines, is a skin and {{respiratory}} irritant. [...] Unless tightly contained, liquid <b>ethylenediamine</b> will release toxic and irritating vapors into its surroundings, especially on heating. The vapors react with moisture in humid air {{to form a}} characteristic white mist, which is extremely irritating to skin, eyes, lungs and mucus membranes. Exposure to a relatively small amount of vapor or mist by inhalation can seriously damage health and may even result in death. <b>Ethylenediamine</b> has a half-life of about 30 minutes in a small volume of distribution of 0.133 liters/kg.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ethylenediamine</b> is an {{ingredient}} in the common bronchodilator drug aminophylline, where it serves to solubilize the active ingredient theophylline. [...] <b>Ethylenediamine</b> has also been used in dermatologic preparations, but {{has been removed from}} some because of causing contact dermatitis. [...] When used as a pharmaceutical excipient, after oral administration its bioavailability is about 0.34, due to a substantial first-pass effect. Less than 20% is eliminated by urinal excretion.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} synthesis of aryl amines. For example, copper(II) hydroxide catalyzes the reaction of <b>ethylenediamine</b> with 1-bromoanthraquinone or 1-amino-4-bromoanthraquinone to form 1-((2-aminoethyl)amino)anthraquinone or 1-amino-4-((2-aminoethyl)amino)anthraquinone, respectively: ...|$|E

2500|$|As a good polar aprotic solvent, 1,2-dichloroethane {{could be}} used as {{degreaser}} and paint remover but is now banned from use due to its toxicity and possible carcinogenity. As a useful 'building block' reagent, it is used as an intermediate in [...] the production of various organic compounds such as <b>ethylenediamine.</b> In the laboratory it is occasionally used as a source of chlorine, with elimination of ethene and chloride.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrapment}} of catalytically active noble metals can {{be accomplished}} by grafting on functional groups to the unsaturated metal site on MOFs. <b>Ethylenediamine</b> (ED) {{has been shown to be}} grafted on the Cr metal sites and can be further modified to encapsulate noble metals such as Pd.

2500|$|Functional linkers can be also {{utilized}} as catalytic sites. A 3D MOF { • 6H2O • 2DMF} (4-BTAPA=1,3,5-benzene {{tricarboxylic acid}} tris , DMF=N,N-dimethylformamide) constructed by tridentate amide linkers and cadmium salt catalyzes the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The pyridine {{groups on the}} ligand 4-BTAPA act as ligands binding to the octahedral cadmium centers, while the amide groups can provide the functionality for interaction with the incoming substrates. Specifically, the – NH moiety of the amide group can act as electron acceptor whereas the C=O group can act as electron donor to activate organic substrates for subsequent reactions. Ferey et al. reported a robust and highly porous MOF [...] (BDC: Benzene-1,4- dicarboxylate) where instead of directly using the unsaturated Cr(III) centers as catalytic sites, the authors grafted <b>ethylenediamine</b> (ED) onto the Cr(III) sites. The uncoordinated ends of ED can act as base catalytic sites, ED-grafted MOF was investigated for Knoevenagel condensation reactions. A significant increase in conversion was observed for ED-grafted MOF compared to untreated framework (98% vs 36%).|$|E
2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as <b>ethylenediamine</b> and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E
