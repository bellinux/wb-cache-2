40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how temperature {{measurements of the}} water filtered by <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> {{can be used to}} determine the soil filtration ratio and to monitor the condition of <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams.</b> The ground water temperature change is caused by the processes of heat conductivity and convection. The analysis of heat transfer within <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> demonstrates that the speed of thermal waves varies between (4 - 6) 10 - 7 m/s. Therefore, whenever the water filtration ratio is under 4 ∙ 10 - 7 m/s, propagation of thermal waves is driven by the heat conductivity. If the soil filtration ratio is below 2 ∙ 10 - 5 m/s, thermal waves are caused by forced convection (the filtration flow). Temperature measurements of the water filtered by <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> composed of non-cohesive soils make it possible to calculate averaged soil filtration ratios with an error under 20 - 40 %. This result is more precise than the one generated through the application of other natural methods (pumping out, use of indicators, etc.). Temperature measurements of the water filtered by <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> composed of cohesive soils make it possible to control their density and water penetration capacity, and to identify their thermal conductivity. This paper demonstrates that the relocation of a thermal wave within non-cohesive soils prevents the filtration flow from remaining in a steady-state condition. As a result, complex secondary water flows are generated within the filtration flow by means of natural convection (the temperature gradient). Secondary water flows in question represent the principal cause of well-known abnormalities of depression curves of <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A dam {{may fail}} when the loading (overtopping flood, flow through or beneath the dam, {{earthquake}} or blasting loading, terrorist attacks, deterioration etc.) exceeds the resistance against overtopping, internal erosion, slope instability, sliding/overturning, excessive deformation etc. To properly describe {{the causes of}} dam failures, {{it is necessary to}} study characteristics of the dams which have experienced failures. In this work, more than 900 dam failure cases throughout the world excluding China are compiled into a database, including details of the dams, the reservoirs, the triggers, and the failures. This paper focuses on failure of earth dams, which makes up 66 % of the whole failure cases in the database. A statistical analysis of the failure characteristics is conducted. According to dam zoning and corewalls, earth dams are divided into four typical categories: (1) homogeneous <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams,</b> (2) zoned <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams,</b> (3) <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> with corewalls, and (4) concrete faced <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams.</b> Further analysis of the failure modes and causes of these subdivided earth dams is carried out. Potential locations at risk are also described to provide the reader with a better understanding of earth dam failures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{the last}} decades, the design floods of {{numerous}} embankment reservoirs were re-evaluated and the revised spillway outflows are typically {{larger than those}} used in the original designs. As a result, a number of overtopping protection systems were developed for embankments and <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams,</b> with applications encompassing river dykes, coastal barriers for storm surge and tsunami protections. Several design techniques were developed for embankments and <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams.</b> These include concrete overtopping protection systems, timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap and gabions, reinforced earth, minimum energy loss (MEL) weirs, embankment overflow stepped spillways and the precast concrete block protection systems. Various designs are reviewed herein and discussed based upon prototype experiences. This review highlights that a safe operation of embankment overflow protection systems relies upon a sound design and a good quality of construction, suitable flow conditions, together with regular maintenance...|$|R

To achieve the aims of a research thesis, we analyzed 39 low <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams.</b> We performed observations and documented their conditions with the aim of clarifying the risk factors. After an analysis of the information materials that characterize dams and after a statistical analysis of the measurement results in situ, including measurements from technical and safety supervision databases, we performed an analysis by using mathematical modeling to evaluate the safety of the dam constructions. Out {{of the total number of}} 39 dam constructions, an analysis of the stability of the dam slopes was performed on 37 dams, and deformation problems were analyzed on 28 of the dams.

2500|$|The Columbia Basin Project {{in central}} Washington changed the {{character}} of Crab Creek substantially. The Crab Creek irrigation-return drainage basin covers an irrigated area of 296mi² (767km²). A large <b>earthfill</b> <b>dam,</b> the O'Sullivan Dam (also {{referred to as the}} Potholes Dam) was constructed from 1947 to 1949, forming Potholes Reservoir, which serves as a central point in the CBP for storage of irrigation water, natural runoff, and irrigation-return flow, allowing irrigation water reuse throughout the southern CBP area. Potholes Reservoir releases water through canals and has no perennial outlet to Lower Crab Creek. Hence today the water in Lower Crab Creek comes from ground-water seepage from Potholes Reservoir and irrigation, from the Goose Lake Wasteway, and from tributary inflows downstream of the O’Sullivan Dam. [...] The water table in this section is variable but generally high due to the low elevation and irrigation runoff. Many lakes, including Merry, Lenice and Nunally Lakes, drain into Crab Creek.|$|E

40|$|<b>Earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> are {{man-made}} geostructures {{which may}} be especially damaged by seismic loadings, because the soil skeleton they are made of suffers remarkable modifications in its mechanical properties, as well as changes of pore water pressure and flow of this water inside their pores, when subjected to vibrations. The most extreme situation is the dam failure due to soil liquefaction. Coupled finite element numerical codes are a useful tool to assess the safety of these dams. In this paper {{the application of a}} fully coupled numerical model, previously developed and validated by the authors, to a set of theoretical cross sections of <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams</b> with impervious core, is presented. All these dams are same height and have the same volume of impervious material at the core. The influence of the core location inside the dam on its response against seismic loading is numerically explored. The dams are designed as strictly stable under static loads. As a result of this research, a design recommendation on the location of the impervious core is obtained for this type of earth dams, {{on the basis of the}} criteria of minor liquefaction risk, minor soil degradation during the earthquake and minor crest settlement...|$|R

The technique of puddling and its use was developed by early canal engineer James Brindley; it is considered his greatest contribution to engineering. This processed material was used extensively in UK canal construction in the period starting circa 1780. Starting about 1840 puddle clay was used more widely as the water-retaining element (or core) within <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams,</b> particularly in the Pennines.

50|$|Brindley's {{technique}} minimised {{the amount}} of earth moving by developing the principle of contouring. He preferred to use a circuitous route that avoided embankments, and tunnels rather than cuttings. Though this recognised the primitive methods of earth-moving available at the time, it meant that his canals were often much longer than a more adventurous approach would have produced. But his greatest contribution was the technique of puddling clay to produce a watertight clay-based material, and its use in lining canals. Puddle clay was used extensively in UK canal construction in the period starting shortly after his death. Starting about 1840 puddle clay was used more widely as the water-retaining element (or core) within <b>earthfill</b> <b>dams,</b> particularly in the Pennines.|$|R

40|$|AbstractImmediately {{after the}} 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, special safety {{inspections}} {{were carried out}} at over 300 dams in the affected area.
