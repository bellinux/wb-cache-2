40|$|Fusarium wilt {{and root}} knot are two {{important}} diseases of tobacco in Hunsur tract of Karnataka,India. Both diseases also form disease complex and {{are known to}} cause severe damage to the crop. The present investigation was carried out under in vitro and in vivo conditions {{to find out the}} possibility of using ecofriendly measures to manage the disease complex. Fungal and bacterial bioagents viz., Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis,Pseudomonas fluorescens were evaluated along with nine chemical fungicides such <b>as</b> <b>Carbendazim,</b> Copper hydroxide, Propiconazole, Difenoconazole, Thiophanate methyl,Mancozeb, Tridemorph, Metalaxyl and Triadimefon...|$|R

Combinations of two systemic fungicides such <b>as</b> <b>carbendazim</b> and thiophanate-methyl with ethyl acetate extract of culture filtrate of antagonistic bacterium Bacillus subtilis were evaluated against P. azadirachtae under in vitro conditions. The parameters studied were mycelial dry weight, colony diameter, pycnidial formation and the conidial germ tube {{growth of the}} pathogen. The effect of these combinations on neem seed germination and seed-borne pathogen was also tested. The {{results indicated that the}} combinations tested were effective in inhibiting the growth of the pathogen in vitro. The combinations also inhibited the growth of P. azadirachtae from die-back infected neem seeds and had no significant negative effect on neem seed germination. These combinations could be utilized for the integrated control of die-back of neem...|$|R

30|$|Up to now, several {{monitoring}} {{studies of}} storm water have been conducted: biocides such <b>as</b> <b>carbendazim,</b> terbutryn, and diuron, {{as well as}} mecoprop, the transformation product of roof-protecting mecoprop esters, were found {{in a study of}} storm water from an urban catchment near Zurich [6]. A study of storm water in a catchment in the UK with an equivalent of 50, 000 inhabitants proved the presence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), trifluralin, nonylphenols, nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs), and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) [7]. Phthalates, nonylphenol, and NPEOs were also detected in storm water in two urban residential areas in Stockholm [8]. A study in the region of Paris investigated compounds in separate sewer systems and detected heavy metals (Cu, Zn), PAH, diuron, monobutyltin (MBT), DEHP, and nonylphenols as contaminants [9]. Storm water monitoring in Copenhagen demonstrated the presence of heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn, as well as PAH, diuron, isoproturon, glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), DEHP, and nonylphenol [10]. Xiao et al. [11] searched especially for perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) and were able to detect them in all storm water samples taken in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.|$|R
