25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or {{getting back to the}} fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski <b>facing</b> <b>uphill</b> relative to the fall line.|$|E

Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever been lost {{on the north side}} of Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.|$|E

5000|$|Labels are a {{critical}} component of elevation maps. A properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain. If numbers are placed close to each other, it means that the terrain is steep. Labels should be placed along a slightly curved line [...] "pointing" [...] to the summit or nadir, from several directions if possible, making the visual identification of the summit or nadir easy. Contour labels can be oriented so a reader is <b>facing</b> <b>uphill</b> when reading the label.|$|E

50|$|Panoramic Way {{is a very}} {{steep and}} narrow public road with {{numerous}} sharp turns and curves serving approximately 500 residents. Traffic can become difficult during rush hours, waste collection times or when construction and service vehicles are present. Emergency vehicles do regular patrols of the area to test their ability to access all residents in case of emergency. The speed limit is limited to 15 mph. Where the street is only wide enough for one car, the car facing downhill must yield to the car <b>facing</b> <b>uphill,</b> as required by California Motor Vehicle Code.|$|E

5000|$|Hebden Bridge is {{a popular}} place to live. However, space is limited due to the steep valleys and lack of flat land. In the past, this led to [...] "upstairs-downstairs" [...] houses known as over and under dwellings. These were houses built in {{terraces}} with 4-5 storeys. The upper storeys <b>face</b> <b>uphill</b> while the lower ones face downhill with their back wall against the hillside. The bottom 2 storeys would be one house while the upper 2-3 storeys would be another. This also led to unusual legal arrangements such as the [...] "flying freehold", where the shared floor/ceiling is wholly owned by the underdwelling.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the vehicle}} is moving in reverse, {{or if it is}} {{stationary}} but <b>facing</b> <b>uphill,</b> the role of the leading and trailing shoes is reversed. A twin-leading design thus becomes twin-trailing, with the rotation of the drum working against the brake shoes, trying to throw them off the drum. The exact opposite of the self-applying effect. [...] A 2LS brake is virtually useless when working in the opposite direction. For this reason, it is more usual to have a leading/trailing drum brake design on the rear of the vehicle, so that there is sufficient braking when travelling in reverse or when parked on a slope.|$|E
50|$|Soon, {{the company}} was looking for {{alternatives}} to the staff and cost-intensive rack railway operations (which with {{the maintenance of the}} Prussian T 26 rack locomotives and the toothed rack sections, particularly in winter, were complex and expensive). As early as 1923, both class 94.5-17 and class 95 locomotives were tested. However, the class 95 locomotives proved to be too heavy because they damaged the rail track superstructure. The experiments with class 94.5-17 locomotives however proved satisfactory and thus the changeover to adhesion operations occurred in 1927 with steam locomotives that could operate on the rack sections (with Riggenbach counter-pressure brakes), which now also hauled the trains while <b>facing</b> <b>uphill</b> because of the comprehensive introduction of fail-safe air brakes and more powerful locomotives.|$|E
