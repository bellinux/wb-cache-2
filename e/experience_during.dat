5|$|After the war, Col. William S. Clark {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in early American/Japanese relations. After establishing the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), Clark was invited {{by the government}} of Japan to establish a similar institution, the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the University of Hokkaido). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas he brought to Hokkaido and the influence he had {{on the development of the}} island. His military <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the Civil War was an important factor in earning the respect of his Japanese superiors.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Retired Lieutenant Colonel Zeke Josepho recounts {{a strange}} <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the Persian Gulf War {{and how he}} claims it brought him to God: as his squad was ambushed during the Battle of Al Busayyah and {{on the verge of}} defeat, four mysterious men showed up and {{defeated}} the enemy with astonishing ease. While Josepho thinks of them as guardian angels, they are revealed to be the almost-indestructible Super Soldiers. In the present, Josepho stands above the wreckage of a spacecraft in Canada.|$|E

Navas Jr., who was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and was named Assistant Secretary of the Navy on June 6, 2001. On September 22, 2015, the documentary “On Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam” examined the Latino <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Bostwick {{started his}} career at Millwall, and played {{regularly}} for the club's under-18 team and reserve team. At the age of 17, he joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the latter stages of 2005–06 season. On return to Millwall, Bostwick signed a new one-year contract with the club, but {{was sent back to}} Crawley Town on loan in August 2006. Bostwick played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007, and was told he was surplus to requirements at the club. He subsequently signed for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract, but only played eight matches before falling out of favour at Nene Park, and was released by Rushden {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 campaign.|$|E
5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief {{that they would be}} useless in a dogfight, but combat <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E

5|$|Rise of the Warrior was {{a graphic}} novel by Marianne Krawczyk with art by Christopher Shy. Only {{available}} on GodofWar.com, {{it was a}} prequel story that tied into Ascensions single-player and multiplayer modes, and had 20 chapters that were released from October 2012 to March 2013. It also featured a social <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> that same time period. For the social experience, players were aligned with either the Spartans or the Trojans and competed via social challenges to earn points, such as answering questions and solving riddles for each chapter. In the first challenge, the teams competed to earn their army a week of exclusive, early access to the multiplayer beta test that began on December 12, and a one-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, which was won by the Spartans; the Trojans received access on December 17. The Spartans also won the next team challenge and received early access to the Prison of the Damned single-player demo on February 20, 2013. Players could also earn early, in-game unlocks for the final game's multiplayer mode, including exclusive weapons and armor for all players who attained the rank of Champion of the Gods.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> the Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} <b>experience</b> <b>during</b> critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

5|$|<b>Experience</b> <b>during</b> {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E
