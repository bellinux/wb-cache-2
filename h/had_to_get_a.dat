5|$|Under Canadian law, miners first <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> license, either {{when they}} arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E

25|$|The War of the Castilian Succession (1475–79) {{provided}} the Catholic Monarchs {{with the opportunity}} not only to attack {{the main source of}} the Portuguese power, but also to take possession of this lucrative commerce. The Crown officially organized this trade with Guinea: every caravel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> government license and to pay a tax on one-fifth of their profits (a receiver of the customs of Guinea was established in Seville in 1475 – the ancestor of the future and famous Casa de Contratación).|$|E

25|$|His mother {{separated}} from Rose, and Lee <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job, his sister already {{working as a}} secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board. With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee, {{and so he was}} sent to the French Riviera, where his sister was on holiday with friends. On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris, where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller, a friend of Rose, and witnessed the execution of Eugen Weidmann, the last person to be executed in public in France. Arriving in Menton, he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family, living among exiled princely families. It was arranged that he should stay on in Menton after his sister had returned home, but with Europe on the brink of war, he returned to London instead. He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines, taking care of the mail and running errands.|$|E

25|$|In Paris Favre {{requested}} {{an officer}} {{to help him}} negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, Charles Horix de Valdan, {{chief of staff to}} the commander of Paris, Joseph Vinoy, was sent along. Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating the lines of control of the two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from the lines of control and the area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral. When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the final document on 28 January 1871. It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas.|$|E
500|$|FreeBSD's roots {{go back to}} the University of California, Berkeley. The {{university}} {{acquired a}} UNIX source license from AT. Students of the university started to modify and improve the AT Unix and called this modified version [...] "Berkeley Unix" [...] or [...] "BSD", implementing features such as TCP/IP, virtual memory and the Unix File System. The BSD project was founded in 1976 by Bill Joy. But since BSD contained code from AT, Unix, all recipients <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> license from AT first in order to use BSD.|$|E

By putting non-standard emphasis on syllables and sounds, his sentences can be confusing and/or humorous (what would now be considered mondegreen). For example, [...] "I {{had to get up}} at eight o'clock" [...] is heard by Fibber and Molly as [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> potato clock", [...] "I got up too early" [...] comes out as [...] "I got up twirly", and his own name sounds like [...] "Herber Tapple" [...] (in [...] "Fibber Puts Up Christmas Lights", 12/20/49).|$|E

2500|$|The massive {{losses from}} the Victory Tour forced the Sullivans to quietly put the Patriots and Sullivan Stadium {{on the market}} in 1985. [...] Prospective buyers balked at the $100 million asking price, but it made more sense after the Patriots made the Super Bowl. [...] By the start of 1988, the Sullivans seemed to be on an {{irreversible}} slide toward bankruptcy. [...] At one point, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> $4 million advance from the league just to make payroll.

My mother said I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E
