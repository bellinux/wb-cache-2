40|$|Environmental, {{plant and}} animal {{exposure}} to hazardous substances from electronic wastes (<b>e-wastes)</b> in Nigeria is increasing. In this study, the potential cytogenotoxicity of <b>e-wastes</b> leachate and contaminated well water samples obtained from Alaba International Electronic Market in Lagos, Nigeria, using induction of chromosome and root growth anomalies in Allium cepa, and micronucleus (MN) in peripheral erythrocytes of Clarias gariepinus, was evaluated. The possible cause of DNA damage via the assessments of liver malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as indicators of oxidative stress in mice was also investigated. There was significant (p < 0. 05) inhibition of root growth and mitosis in A. cepa. Cytological aberrations such as spindle disturbance, C-mitosis and binucleated cells, and morphological alterations like tumor and twisting roots were also induced. There was concentration-dependent, significant (p < 0. 05) induction of micronucleated erythrocytes and nuclear abnormalities such as blebbed nuclei and binucleated erythrocytes in C. gariepinus. A significant increase (p < 0. 001) in CAT, GSH and MDA with concomitant decrease in SOD concentrations were observed in the treated mice. Pb, As, Cu, Cr, and Cd analyzed in the tested samples contributed significantly to these observations. This shows that the well water samples and leachate contained substances capable of inducing somatic mutation and oxidative stress in living cells; and this is of health importance in countries with risk of <b>e-wastes</b> exposure...|$|R
40|$|Electronic wastes (<b>e-wastes)</b> pose a {{significant}} threat {{to human health}} and the ecosystem, due to both the volume of wastes produced and the hazardous materials contained. Discarded electronic equipment is {{one of the fastest growing}} waste streams worldwide, due to the increasing growth rate of the Information Technology (IT) market and the rapid obsolescence of the equipment. The European Union has characterized the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), in general, as one of the key waste streams and has already developed the framework for their management. Although a lot of EU countries have already launched their electronic wastes policy, Greece started the efforts quite recently. Granted that the Greek IT market is expected to grow significantly in the near future, it is obvious that the need for immediate action is more urgent than ever, so as to be able to deal with the problems that will occur due to the accumulation of significant quantities of <b>e-wastes.</b> The paper presents the process so far of a project, funded by European Regional Development Fund, which aims to develop an integrated management system for electronic wastes in the Attica Region...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{computer}} parts contain hazardous materials, {{there is}} a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts. Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as: lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium. According to the EPA these <b>e-wastes</b> have a harmful effect on the environment unless they are disposed of properly. Making hardware requires energy, and recycling parts will reduce air pollution, water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Disposing unauthorized computer equipment is in fact illegal. Legislation makes it mandatory to recycle computers through the government approved facilities. Recycling a computer can be made easier by taking out certain reusable parts. For example, the RAM, DVD drive, the graphics card, hard drive or SSD, and other similar removable parts can be reused.|$|R

25|$|<b>E-waste</b> is {{a growing}} problem, {{accounting}} for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle <b>e-waste</b> responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the economy in China has been coupled with {{increasing}} environmental pollution. The coastal and estuarine ecosystems in China are now facing increasing metal pollution pressures because of the elevated metal discharges from various sources. Industrial and domestic sewage discharges, mining, smelling, <b>e-wastes</b> recycling are important sources contributing to coastal pollution in China. In this review, status of metal contamination along China's coasts is assessed by a comprehensive review of metal concentrations recorded in sediments and marine organisms over the past ten years. Studies show that metal contamination in the coastal environments is closely associated with accelerated economic growth in the past decades. High metal contents can be detected in the sediments collected across the coasts in China. Alarmingly high metal concentrations are observed in the sediments, water and organisms collected from the heavily industrialized areas. Metal levels observed in marine bivalves also consistently reflect the elevated metal contamination. Elevated levels of metal contamination along China's coastal environment can increase the risk of metal exposure to humans by seafood consumption, raising the alarm for more stringent control of discharge of metals into environment.

Thus, plenty of companies regard reverse logistics as a strategy {{not only for the}} purposes to save material consumption by reusing them, but also to reduce their negative influences on society and environment. As a serious problem in China, <b>e-wastes</b> have already damaged the people’s daily life. Some measures are encouraged by government that the electronic products manufacturers have obligation to dispose their electronic returns. This research is aimed to have a empirical investigation on the practicing of Chinese reverse logistics in the electronic products manufacturing industry. A depth interview is utilized to acquire the primary information about Chinese reverse logistics. The findings of this research is that the discarded electronic products could not be remanufactured sufficiently. The system of Chinese reverse logistics may become more efficient if closing the loop by taking back the cores that have been flowed into the irregular channel. The primary difficulties are analyzed in the discussion section as well as a return policy is designed for collecting the cores from rural villages...|$|R

25|$|Many {{types of}} {{batteries}} employ toxic {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (<b>e-waste).</b> <b>E-waste</b> recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones. The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.|$|E

40|$|Gold {{solubility}} in the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag {{system was}} measured at 1773 K (1500 C) under a CO 2 -CO atmosphere {{over a wide}} range of compositions, i. e., 8 to 40 mass pct CaO, 26 to 50 mass pct SiO 2, and 0 to 36 mass pct Al 2 O 3, to determine the dissolution mechanism of gold in the CaO-based metallurgical slags. Gold solubility in the present slag system increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure and increasing activity of CaO. From the thermodynamic analysis, the dissolution mechanism of gold into the (alumino-) silicate melts is proposed as follows according to the activity of basic oxide, which indicates that the predominant species of gold is dependent on slag basicity. AuðsÞ þ 1 4 O 2 ðgÞ þ 1 2 O 2 ¼ AuO ð Þ; ð Þ aBO 0 : 1 The enthalpy change for the dissolution of gold into the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag system was measured to be about 80 kJ/mol, indicating that the gold dissolution is exothermic. From the iso-Au solubility contours, the dominant factor affecting the gold dissolution behavior is the (CaO + MgO) /SiO 2 ratio, whereas the influence of Al 2 O 3 was negligible. Consequently, less basic slags and higher processing temperatures, in conjunction with a strongly reducing atmosphere, are recommended to increase gold recovery during pyro-processing of Au-containing <b>e-wastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth {{in recent years has}} transformed our lifestyle to massively produce, consume, and dispose of products, especially for consumer electronics. This change has put great threat to our environment and caused natural resource depletion. Moreover, short product life cycles and quick replacements of consumer electronics create enormous electronic wastes (<b>e-wastes).</b> Without proper waste management, immense environmental damage is expected. In this empirical study, we notice that lots of valuable materials that can still be recycled from these used consumer electronics are left unused at home instead of being recycled at the appropriate time, which causes a low collection rate and a decrease in residual value for the used products. Therefore, {{it is important for the}} government and the recyclers to handle them efficiently by increasing the used product take-back rate. Our study develops an assessment model for customer value based on the idea of value engineering and the perspective of product life cycle. We also explore the relationship between product value and the total cost of ownership with an evaluation of their time variation, considering different usage modes for various consumer groups and different recycling award schemes (fixed and variable recycling awards). Proper take-back management is likely to create a win-win situation both for consumers and environmental protection. This study regards the notebook computer as an example to determine the optimal time for recycling laptops based on usage patterns and provides consumers a reference for when to replace their used product. The results from our modeling firstly clearly indicate that consumers with higher frequency of usage have shorter take back times and higher maximum consumer value. Secondly, a variable recycling award scheme with higher maximum consumer value is more practical than a fixed recycling award scheme...|$|R

25|$|Although {{consumer}} electronics {{such as the}} television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up, many countries {{did not have the}} capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of <b>e-waste</b> they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process. The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, <b>e-waste</b> grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.|$|E
