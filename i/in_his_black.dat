Robert Motherwell in his Elegy to the Spanish Republic series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.|$|E

He went to pick up a consignment of gold from the local bank with which to pay his Canutillo ranch staff. While driving back through the city <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>black</b> 1919 Dodge touring car, Villa passed by a school, and a pumpkinseed vendor ran toward his car and shouted Viva Villa!, a signal to a group of seven riflemen who then appeared {{in the middle of the}} road and fired more than 40 shots into the automobile. In the fusillade, nine dumdum bullets, normally used for hunting big game, hit Villa in the head and upper chest, killing him instantly.|$|E
