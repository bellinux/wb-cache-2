500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the Big 8's {{official}} {{ruling on}} the matter, the reactions from many {{on all sides}} were not {{in agreement with the}} Big 8 committee in the end. When asked at the Look All-America gathering in New York City Missouri All-American, Danny LaRose said, [...] "It'll always be a 9–1 season as far as I'm concerned. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> players will feel that way, too." [...] However, LaRose also expressed his admiration of the Big Eight [...] "for standing up for what was right – enforcing its own rules". Also at the gathering, Colorado All-American guard Joe Romig echoed similar feelings when he said, [...] "I don't care what the NCAA or the Big Eight does. We lost the game at Kansas. Nothing will change that." [...] Meanwhile, Kansas All-American quarterback John Hadl expressed more concern about his teammate when asked at the All-America gathering and had this to say, [...] "He's a good guy. I hope it doesn't hit him too hard." [...] Missouri head coach Dan Devine expressed his apparent disappointment in the process adopted by the Big 8 when he said, [...] "This is {{the worst thing that could}} happen in inter-collegiate athletics. I mean the fact that they were playing a boy not knowing he was ineligible. That should have been determined before he played." [...] For his part then executive secretary of the Big 8, Reaves Peters, said the case was the [...] "toughest case to come before us in history".|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly, Ellerby. This end, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>other's</b> yours, though I'm afraid you'll have a poor time bowling fast to-day. Even {{with plenty}} of sawdust I doubt if it will be {{possible}} to get a decent foothold till after lunch." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “I expect {{they intend}} to leave us alone and take us into Algiers. However, that does not matter.

6000|$|... "It is a Traitor and a Spy," [...] said Captain Carton, {{handing me}} {{the gun to}} load again. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> name of the animal is Christian George King!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> four will {{be enough}} for the boats. You did not go ashore {{last time you were}} here, I think, Mr. Glover," [...] he added with a slight smile.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the bankers}} subscribed five {{thousand}} dollars, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> one subscribed half as much, but I {{do not remember}} with certainty now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of them came from Paris.|$|E

60|$|For {{what seems}} now a long space of time I {{had not seen}} her {{or any of the}} family except Philip; it was {{certainly}} a year or more, probably two; Maxton was at a crammer's and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> must have been in Canada with Lord Ladislaw. Then came some sort of estrangement between him and his wife, and she returned with Mary and Guy to Burnmore and stayed there all through the summer.|$|R

6000|$|The old gentleman caressed his elbows, {{which he}} was holding in the palms of his hands, in high {{enjoyment}} of Colville's sarcasm. [...] "Ah! very good! very good!" [...] he said. [...] "I quite agree with you, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> sort are altogether preferable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just on a}} {{par with}} Aaron Poole's actions in general," [...] said Mr. Wadsworth. [...] "He would claim the earth, if he dared. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{property}} owners along that road will have something to say if he tries to close it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{put it all}} by, Bill. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> will be enough. This four shillings a week we {{will put}} aside at present for clothes. We want two more shirts apiece, and some more stockings, and we shall want some shoes before long, and another suit of clothes each. We must keep {{ourselves}} decent, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would do}} splendidly. It'll {{be a good}} match. For all {{practical}} purposes, of course, it's the final. If we beat Seymour's, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> will trouble us much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{going to}} sail with no such fellers as you," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "And <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> men {{will want to}} sail with you, either.

6000|$|... "No doubt Mozwa has forgotten, {{or it may}} be that he iss away to seek for his frund Nazinred {{among the}} Eskimos. No metter. We will camp here, whatever, for <b>the</b> night. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side o' that point will be a goot campin' ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|Grier laughed. [...] "I guess we'll {{fix them}} without you. It's quite {{easy to find}} out things, now the gangs are broken up. I heard from Regina the other day, {{and the man who}} got the bullet in his leg is already doing {{something}} useful--making roads, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>other</b> fellow is going out with the work gang as soon as he's strong enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no; don't put it off," [...] Mrs. Grantham said; [...] "we {{have only}} another {{fortnight}} before James must be back again in London, {{and it would}} be a great pity to lose three or four days perhaps; and we have been looking forward to cruising about among the Channel Islands, and to St. Malo, and all those places. Oh no; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is much the better plan--that is, if you won't take us with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wasn't {{selected}} {{with the}} idea that you would be of very much assistance, Chris. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fellows wanted to confer an honour upon you, even though you are the youngest of the party. That's what comes of always being good-natured, and ready to do a comrade a friendly turn. We shall get this pole into position without your help, and you might find yourself in trouble at home by remaining out-of-doors as long as I think it will be necessary for us to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} the Grimstones," [...] Wilfrid, who had always gone for a daily chat with the men forward, said; [...] "they {{will be glad to}} join us in the watch, and <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> men forward would do so too. I know they all find it very hard work to get through the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is one enemy the less," [...] Edgar said, [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> will trouble us much in future.

6000|$|... "Uncommon kind of you, sir, I'm sure," [...] said Pen's emissary. [...] "I told my {{principal}} that <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{man would}} fight," [...] he continued {{with a great}} air of dignity. [...] "He prefers being flogged to fighting, sir, I dare say. May I offer you any refreshment, Mr.? I haven't the advantage of your name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On some conditions, {{to which}} I can't agree," [...] Wyndham rejoined. [...] "Your secret is worth money, {{but you can}} use it in one of two ways. You mean to smuggle the stuff into England in small {{quantities}} at a monopoly price; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> line would pay you better. Ship all you can, develop the trade openly, and although the price will drop and you may have rivals, the sums paid will be large and you will be first on the ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{in another}} {{three or four}} days I shall be able to be out, Jacob. If I find that these people were here at the time I landed I shall have no doubt that this {{business}} was their work. I knew the man by sight and he may have known me. Someone may have pointed me out to him on the racecourse, as I had been asking about him. Of course it may have been done merely for the sake of plunder, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> is more likely.' ...|$|E
60|$|My father's face {{shone with}} {{the light of the}} explorer, the pioneer. The words of this song appealed to him as the finest poetry. It meant all that was fine and hopeful and buoyant in American life, to him--but on my mother's sweet face a wistful {{expression}} deepened and in her fine eyes a reflective shadow lay. To her this song meant not so much the acquisition of a new home as the loss of all her friends and relatives. She sang it submissively, not exultantly, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> women were of the same mood though their faces were less expressive to me. To all of the pioneer wives of the past that song had meant deprivation, suffering, loneliness, heart-ache.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wrong, Mr. Easterfield," [...] said Olive, {{speaking}} very gravely. [...] "I never saw {{any one of these}} young men before I came here except Mr. Hemphill, and he was an entirely different person when I knew him before, and I have given no one of them any special encouragement. If Mr. Locker were not such an impetuous young man, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> would have been more deliberate, but as {{it was easy to see}} the state of his mind, and as we are all making but a temporary stay here, these other young men saw that they must act quickly, or not at all. This, while it was very amusing, was also a little annoying, and I should greatly have preferred slower and more deliberate movements on the part of these young men. But all my feelings changed when my father's letter came to me. I was glad then that they had proposed already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Pillin? I {{know your}} son. Been' seeing the chairman? I see your sale's gone through all right. I hope that'll do us some good, but <b>I</b> suppose you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way?" ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{debate was}} in progress, or rather raging. Its subject {{seemed to be}} as to whether images {{should or should not}} be worshipped in churches. It was a furious thing, that debate. One party to it were called Iconoclasts, that was the party which did not like images, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> party were called Orthodox, but of this I am not sure. So furious was it that I, the general and {{governor}} of the prison, had been commanded by those in authority to attend in order to prevent violence. The beginnings of what happened I do not remember. What I do remember is that the anti-Iconoclasts, the party to which the Empress Irene belonged, that was therefore the fashionable sect, being, as it seemed to me, worsted in argument, fell back on violence.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after the}} French arrived, four hundred of us Americans {{were put on}} board transports, and we sailed for Halifax, under the convoy of the Ramilies. A day or two after we got out, we fell in with an American privateer, which {{continued}} hovering around us for several days. As this was a bold fellow, frequently coming within gun-shot, and sporting his sticks and canvass {{in all sorts of}} ways, Sir Thomas Hardy felt afraid he would get one of the four transports, and he took all us prisoners into the Ramilies. We staid in the ship the rest of the passage, and when we went into Halifax it was all alone, the four transports having disappeared. Two of them subsequently got in; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two were actually taken by that saucy fellow.|$|E
6000|$|You once--only once--gave {{the world}} {{assurance}} of a waistcoat. You wore it, sir, I think, in [...] "Money." [...] It {{was a remarkable}} and precious waistcoat, wherein certain broad stripes of blue or purple disported themselves as {{by a combination of}} extraordinary circumstances, too happy to occur again. I have seen it on your manly chest in private life. I saw it, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> day in the cold light of morning--with feelings easier to be imagined than described. Mr. Macready, sir, are you a father? If so, lend me that waistcoat for five minutes. I am bidden to a wedding (where fathers are made), and my artist cannot, I find (how should he?), imagine such a waistcoat. Let me show it to him as a sample of my tastes and wishes; and--ha, ha, ha, ha!--eclipse the bridegroom! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand," [...] said Meiklewham, [...] "that if {{any thing}} should chance wrang, (and Heaven kens that the best-laid schemes will gang ajee,) {{it will be}} a great comfort to <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} losers will only be the poor folk, that have the parish between them and absolute starvation--if your sister spent her ain siller, {{it would be a very}} different story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lord Hampstead, [...] "I am {{very fond}} {{of this kind of}} thing. That fox has broken, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> cover." [...] Then he trotted off down a little lane between two loose-built walls, so narrow that there was no space for two men to ride abreast. His object at that moment was to escape Crocker rather than to look after the hounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have done}} nothing; the gentlemen came very fast {{to buy the}} dressing-gowns and {{embroidered}} waistcoats, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> any of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ladies would have sold more; I didn't {{know what to say}} about them." ...|$|R
