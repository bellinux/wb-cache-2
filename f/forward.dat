5|$|The <b>forward</b> {{exchange}} rate (also {{referred to as}} <b>forward</b> rate or <b>forward</b> price) is the {{exchange rate}} at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a <b>forward</b> contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into <b>forward</b> contracts {{to take advantage of}} the <b>forward</b> rate for hedging purposes. The <b>forward</b> exchange rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the <b>forward</b> rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. <b>Forward</b> exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the <b>forward</b> rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at}} which a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The <b>forward</b> {{exchange rate}} is a type of <b>forward</b> price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a <b>forward</b> contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the <b>forward</b> market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a <b>forward</b> contract to lock in a <b>forward</b> exchange rate. Hedging with <b>forward</b> contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by <b>forward</b> contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote <b>forward</b> rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
30|$|The {{second problem}} with these routing {{protocols}} {{is that their}} <b>forwarding</b> strategies suffer from sudden link rupture problem due the high mobility of the vehicular nodes which cause packet loss.

30|$|When {{the packet}} is <b>forwarded</b> {{to the edge}} of a partition, it has to wait until further <b>forwarding</b> can take place. When at least one node enters the <b>forwarding</b> area this wait ends, and <b>forwarding</b> can continue. The {{property}} of this <b>forwarding</b> will not be the same as the <b>forwarding</b> experienced by the source node when the packet was generated. The reason is that a custodian candidate in the <b>forwarding</b> area after a wait will be found close {{to the edge of}} the current custodian's <b>forwarding</b> area. This is due to the fact that the node movements are small during a retry interval compared to the size of the <b>forwarding</b> area. We will see that this will have significant implications for the <b>forwarding</b> distribution.|$|R
5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a <b>forward</b> membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this <b>forward</b> membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed <b>forward,</b> extending the <b>forward</b> membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed <b>forward,</b> but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E

50|$|Call <b>forwarding,</b> or call diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. Call <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the <b>forwarded</b> line usually rings once to remind the customer using call <b>forwarding</b> that the call is being redirected. More consistently, the <b>forwarded</b> line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. Call <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} <b>forwarded</b> line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> calls. Call <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which calls should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, call <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect call <b>forwarding.</b> Call <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to call <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over call <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow call <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

The simulation experiments were also made to study the <b>forwarding</b> efficiency of IP <b>forwarding</b> and vector <b>forwarding.</b> The theoretical and experimental results prove that the vector <b>forwarding</b> method is more efficient than IP <b>forwarding</b> which can provide powerful evidence to the application of vector network in the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Data link level <b>forwarding</b> {{provides}} {{simple and}} fast packet <b>forwarding</b> capability. One {{primary reason for}} the simplicity of layer 2 <b>forwarding</b> comes from its short, fixed length labels. A node <b>forwarding</b> at network layer must parse a relatively large header, and perform a longest-prefix match to determine a <b>forwarding</b> path. When a node performs layer 2 <b>forwarding</b> it can do direct index lookup into its <b>forwarding</b> table with the short header. It is arguably simpler to build layer 2 <b>forwarding</b> hardware that it is to build layer 3 <b>forwarding</b> hardware because the layer 2 <b>forwarding</b> function is less complex. [2] By bypassing the conventional IP <b>forwarding</b> (the packet assembly/reassembly) process using cell-relaying, we could dramatically reduce both the IP packet processing delay and the queuing delay at the router. [5] Pushing traffic to layer 3 may cause congestion. If data is discarded or lost TCP will backoff. 1...|$|R
5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the <b>forward</b> line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the <b>forward</b> line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} main key <b>forward</b> at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the <b>forward</b> line, he would instead be used as a floating <b>forward.</b> He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the <b>forward</b> line. After playing in the <b>forward</b> line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E

The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the squadron encountered heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and could not move <b>forward.</b> To assist them, two troops from the 4th Squadron, were ordered to charge on horseback.

40|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} in nodal mobility, DTN routing usually employs multi-copy <b>forwarding</b> schemes. To avoid the cost associated with flooding, much {{effort has been}} focused on probabilistic <b>forwarding,</b> which aims to reduce the cost of <b>forwarding</b> while retaining a high performance rate by <b>forwarding</b> messages only to nodes that have high delivery probabilities. This paper aims to provide an optimal <b>forwarding</b> protocol which maximizes the expected delivery rate while satisfying a certain constant on the number of forwardings per message. In our proposed optimal probabilistic <b>forwarding</b> (OPF) protocol, we use an optimal probabilistic <b>forwarding</b> metric derived by modeling each <b>forwarding</b> as an optimal stopping rule problem. We also present several extensions to allow OPF to use only partial routing information and work with other probabilistic <b>forwarding</b> schemes such as ticket-based <b>forwarding.</b> We implement OPF and several other protocols and perform trace-driven simulations. Simulation results show that the delivery rate of OPF is only 5 % lower than epidemic, and 20 % greater than the state-of-the-art delegation <b>forwarding</b> while generating 5 % more copies and 5 % longer delay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new <b>forwarding</b> {{mechanism}} for IP multicast based on Explicit Multicast (Xcast). Compared with traditional IP multicast, our mechanism achieves {{a more flexible}} allocation of multicast <b>forwarding</b> states among routers. Previous works only focus on {{reducing the number of}} routers which store the <b>forwarding</b> states, ignoring the distribution of <b>forwarding</b> states among routers. The number of <b>forwarding</b> states stored in each router may be unbalanced. In this paper, we formulate the assignment of the routers with <b>forwarding</b> states as two optimization problems. The first one is to minimize the number of routers with the <b>forwarding</b> states in each multicast tree. The second one is to minimize the maximum number of <b>forwarding</b> states stored in a router. We design several algorithms for both problems. We prove that our algorithms can find the optimal solution to the first problem. By simulation, we also show that our algorithms perform well in the second problem. Moreover, we prove that assigning all branching routers as the only routers with the <b>forwarding</b> states is a special case in our mechanism. Due to higher flexibility, we show that our mechanism use fewer <b>forwarding</b> states, and the distribution of <b>forwarding</b> states is more balanced.

5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the <b>forward</b> {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight.

By that point, almost all of the compartments in the <b>forward</b> part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship <b>forward</b> of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; <b>forward</b> draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E

The <b>forward</b> exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{flooding}} attacks that exploit routing anomalies in the Internet. In particular, {{we focus on}} routing anomalies introduced by persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops. Persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops may share one or more links with <b>forwarding</b> paths to reachable addresses. An attacker can exploit persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops to overload the shared links to disrupt the Internet connectivity to those reachable addresses. To understand the extent of this vulnerability, we perform extensive measurements to systematically study persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops {{and the number of}} network addresses that can be affected. We find that persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops do exist in the current Internet. About 0. 2 % of routable addresses experience persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops and 0. 21 % of routable addresses can be attacked by exploiting persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops. In addition, 85. 16 % of the persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops appear within destination domains and they can be observed from various locations, which makes it possible to launch attacks from many vantage points. We also find that most persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops are just two hops long, which enables an attacker to amplify traffic to persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of exploiting the vulnerability of persistent <b>forwarding</b> loops to launch DDoS attacks. ...|$|R
