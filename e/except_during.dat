5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E

5000|$|An adiabat looks {{similar to}} an isotherm, <b>except</b> that <b>during</b> an expansion, an adiabat loses more {{pressure}} than an isotherm, {{so it has}} a steeper inclination (more vertical).|$|R
5|$|Lawton {{lies in a}} dry {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with frequent variations in weather daily, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> the constantly hot and dry summer months. Frequent strong winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help to lessen the hotter weather. Northerly winds during the winter can occasionally intensify cold periods.|$|E
5|$|Participants in est {{are told}} that they cannot take notes during the course, {{and at the end}} of the seminar the {{instructor}} declines to go over a review of the training. In order to participate in the course, trainees must adhere to agreements which include: they may not exit the course facility <b>except</b> <b>during</b> specified break time, they cannot sit next to someone they knew before coming to the course, and they cannot take unprescribed medications or alcohol for the week prior to the training.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency <b>except</b> <b>during</b> pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
60|$|The volumes, therefore, {{to which}} the present pages form a Preface are entirely the {{composition}} of the Author by whom they are now acknowledged, with the exception, always, of avowed quotations, and such unpremeditated and involuntary plagiarisms as can scarce be guarded against by any one who has read and written a great deal. The original manuscripts are all in existence, and entirely written (horresco referens) in the Author's own hand, <b>excepting</b> <b>during</b> the years 1818 and 1819, when, being affected with severe illness, he was obliged to employ the assistance of a friendly amanuensis.|$|R

5|$|Solitary animals {{defend a}} {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese shield rests {{over the}} armillary sphere. <b>Except</b> <b>during</b> {{the reign of}} Afonso I, it is present in every single {{historical}} flag, {{in one form or}} another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with the first elements of today's shield appearing during the reign of Sancho I. The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.|$|E
5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, {{and did not}} have international scheduled services again until 1987, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E

5|$|The {{parliamentary}} clerk {{continued to}} live alongside the tower, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> the interregnum of 1649 and 1660, when the House of Lords was temporarily abolished. The sewer feeding into the moat was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies.

5|$|Belgium won {{the first}} four—unofficial—matches against the Netherlands, but lost their first FIFA-recognised contest. The two {{national}} teams played each other biannually between 1905 and 1964, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> the World Wars. They have met 18 times in major tournament campaigns, and have played at least 35 friendly cup matches: in Belgium for the Coupe Vanden Abeele, and in the Netherlands for the Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad-Beker. The overall balance favours the Netherlands, with 55 wins against 41 Belgian victories. The Low Countries' squads co-operated in fundraising initiatives between 1925 and 1941; they played five unofficial games for charity, FIFA and the Belgian Olympic Committee.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could be tempted to make common cause with them. The Romans would then be faced by an enemy that included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical advantages over tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|Readville is a {{passenger}} rail station located slightly northwest of Wolcott Square in the Readville {{section of the}} Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It serves multiple lines on the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) Commuter Rail system, {{with access to the}} Fairmount Line and Franklin Line on separate platforms.

The station has platforms in place on the Northeast Corridor, but they are not used by Providence/Stoughton Line trains <b>except</b> <b>during</b> service disruptions.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to {{withdraw}} the four remaining Deutschland-class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, {{as demonstrated by the}} loss of Pommern. Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, <b>except</b> <b>during</b> 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April Schleswig-Holstein was sent to Altenbruch {{at the mouth of the}} Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. Schleswig-Holstein was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.|$|E

60|$|Considering {{that these}} islands are placed {{directly}} under the equator, the climate {{is far from being}} excessively hot; this seems chiefly caused by the singularly low temperature of the surrounding water, brought here by the great southern Polar current. <b>Excepting</b> <b>during</b> one short season very little rain falls, and even then it is irregular; but the clouds generally hang low. Hence, whilst the lower parts of the islands are very sterile, the upper parts, at a height of a thousand feet and upwards, possess a damp climate and a tolerably luxuriant vegetation. This is especially the case on the windward sides of the islands, which first receive and condense the moisture from the atmosphere.|$|R
