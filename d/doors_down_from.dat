Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released." ...|$|R

60|$|Before me gleamed {{the lights}} of a little wayside tavern, and since it might suit me better to lie there than to journey on to Gualdo, I drew rein before that humble <b>door,</b> and got <b>down</b> <b>from</b> my wearied horse. Despite the early hour the door was already barred, for the bedding of {{travellers}} formed {{no part of the}} traffic of so lowly a house as this nameless, wayside wine-shop. Theirs was a trade that ended with the daylight. Nevertheless I was assured they could be made to find me a rag of straw to lie on, and so I knocked boldly with my whip.|$|R

50|$|The land {{on which}} the house sites was once owned by William and Anne Hutchinson, famous for {{their role in the}} Antinomian Controversy. The {{original}} dwelling was probably destroyed in the 1711 Boston fire.

Even then the neighborhood was urban, and the house stood three <b>doors</b> <b>down</b> the square <b>from</b> the Revere House. William Shippard purchased the house in 1747.

60|$|He {{thought it}} over {{for a day or}} two, but he did not spend his whole time in doing so. When he had no customers, he sauntered about in the little parlor over the shop, with its odd old furniture, its quaint prints on the walls, and its absurd {{ornaments}} on the mantelpiece. The other little rooms seemed almost as funny to him, and he was sorry when the bell on the shop <b>door</b> called him <b>down</b> <b>from</b> their contemplation. It was pleasant to him to think that he owned all these odd things. The ownership of the varied goods in the shop also gave him an agreeable feeling which none of his other possessions had ever afforded him. It was all so odd and novel.|$|R
