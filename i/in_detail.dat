40|$|Stability {{analysis}} of the Kantowski-Sachs type universe in pure higher derivative gravity theory is studied <b>in</b> <b>details.</b> The non-redundant generalized Friedmann equation {{of the system is}} derived by introducing a reduced one dimensional generalized KS type action. This method greatly reduces the labor in deriving field equations of any complicate models. Existence and stability of inflationary solution in the presence of higher derivative terms are also studied <b>in</b> <b>details.</b> Implications to the choice of physical theories are discussed <b>in</b> <b>details</b> <b>in</b> this paper.
