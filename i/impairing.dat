40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the oral hygiene status and dental caries {{experience}} among institutionalized visually <b>impaired</b> and hearing <b>impaired</b> children of age between 7 and 17 years in Bhopal city of Madhya Pradesh located in Central India. Materials and Methods: A total of 95 hearing <b>impaired</b> and 48 visually <b>impaired</b> children of age between 7 and 17 years were recruited from special care institutions (one institution of hearing <b>impaired</b> and two institutions of visually <b>impaired)</b> in Bhopal city. Information related to different study variables was obtained from both groups. Oral hygiene index simplified (OHI[S]), decayed,extracted, filled teeth (deft and DECAYED, MISSING, FILLED TETTH (DMFT)) indices were used to record the oral hygiene status and dental caries experience. Results: Mean OHI(S) score for hearing <b>impaired</b> was 1. 15 ± 0. 72 while it was 1. 51 ± 0. 93 for visually <b>impaired</b> children (P < 0. 05). Mean DMFT score was 1. 4 ± 1. 95 and 0. 94 ± 1. 45 among hearing <b>impaired</b> and visually <b>impaired</b> respectively. The hearing <b>impaired</b> had a mean deft score of 0. 47 ± 1. 01 and in visually <b>impaired</b> it was 0. 19 ± 0. 79 and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Oral hygiene status of hearing <b>impaired</b> children was better than visually <b>impaired</b> and the difference was statistically significant. There was no significant difference between both groups with respect to DMFT. The hearing <b>impaired</b> children had significantly higher deft than visually <b>impaired...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or <b>impairing</b> symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further <b>impairing</b> Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in <b>impairing</b> memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by <b>impairing</b> {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by <b>impairing</b> the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly <b>impairing</b> his speed and marksmanship. Loco then {{stands in the}} doorway, ready to face the {{weakened}} Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him.

As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E

40|$|Hearing loss {{results in}} {{disruption}} of coordination in muscles and structures engaged in speech timing tasks and consequently acquisition of speech sounds is affected. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate and compare the speed and intelligibility of speech in hearing <b>impaired</b> and normal hearing Persian speaking elementary school boys and girls. 33 hearing <b>impaired</b> students are randomly selected from three hearing <b>impaired</b> groups (profound, severe and moderately-severe) and compared with 60 normal hearing students. The speed of speech was measured according to reading Words Per Minute (WPM), and speech intelligibility was tested by a 5 -rank scale method. As expected, the normal hearing had more speed and intelligibility of speech in contrast to the hearing <b>impaired</b> group. Also hearing <b>impaired</b> boys had a better speed and intelligibility of speech compared to hearing <b>impaired</b> girls but in normal hearing group, girls had better speed. The amount of P-value for moderately-severe and sever hearing <b>impaired</b> was 0. 006 and this amount for profound and moderately-severe hearing <b>impaired</b> was 0. 002, so p-value is < 0. 05 and significantly important.

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by <b>impairing</b> the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E
5|$|Ray Davies {{released}} the solo album Storyteller, a companion piece to X-Ray, in 1998. Originally written {{two years earlier}} as a cabaret-style show, it celebrated his old band and his estranged brother. Seeing the programming possibilities in his music/dialogue/reminiscence format, the American music television network VH1 launched a series of similar projects featuring established rock artists titled VH1 Storytellers. Dave Davies spoke favourably of a Kinks reunion in early 2003, and as the 40th anniversary of the group's breakthrough neared, both of the Davies brothers expressed interest in working together again. However, hopes for a reunion were dashed when in June 2004 Dave suffered a stroke while exiting an elevator, temporarily <b>impairing</b> his ability to speak and play guitar. Following Dave's recovery, the Kinks were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with {{all four of the}} original band members in attendance. The award was presented by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, a longtime Kinks fan and friend of Ray Davies. The induction helped fuel sales for the group; in August 2007, a re-entry of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation of material spanning the band's career, reached number 32 on the UK Top 100 album chart and number one on the UK Indie album chart.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead <b>impairing</b> their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis project {{addresses}} {{the application of}} educational drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. It reports on three years of research and practical experience {{in the area and}} aims to highlight how important and relevant drama is for this population, thus pioneering a broad and purposeful usage of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. An implementation of educational drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children requires an understanding of both drama, in its educational and therapeutic forms, and vision impairment and its implications. In this way the project sought to investigate the areas of drama, drama therapy and vision impairment separately before addressing the application of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children. The first part of the thesis reports on this theoretical background information. The second part of the thesis links these areas and reports on the application of drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children {{in the form of a}} manual. After establishing a case for drama with vision <b>impaired</b> children, the project provides practical information as to how to implement drama techniques with the vision <b>impaired</b> child. An 'action cycle' is put forward involving observation, planning, implementation and evaluation stages. Teaching methods are given and discussed for the singularly <b>impaired</b> vision <b>impaired</b> child, the child with additional impairment and, to a lesser extent, the multiply <b>impaired</b> vision <b>impaired</b> child. Examples are used extensively throughout and case-study material is provided. The project {{addresses the}} following audiences: (i) teachers working with vision <b>impaired</b> children who would like to implement drama techniques (ii) teachers, including drama teachers, who have a vision <b>impaired</b> child in their class and who would like to know more about vision impairment and how drama can be utilised with a vision <b>impaired</b> child (iii) others, outside the field of education, such as therapists, medical practitioners and care-givers who are involved with vision <b>impaired</b> children (iv) parents of vision <b>impaired</b> children (v) as the vision <b>impaired</b> population includes many children with additional disability, including physical, intellectual, hearing, emotional and social problems, the project may be useful for those working with children with impairments other than visual.

40|$|Acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI) {{frequently}} {{results in a}} characteristic spectrum of physical, cognitive, and behavioural consequences. Individuals with ABI are often unable to appreciate these consequences and comprehend the influence of these deficits on everyday life. These individuals {{are said to have}} <b>impaired</b> awareness. A selective overview of the literature on <b>impaired</b> awareness following ABI is presented. Emphasis is placed on terminology, theories, measurement, treatment, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress. It was established that the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and aspects of neuropsychological and mood functioning is still unclear. In addition, relatively few empirical studies have investigated treatment techniques for <b>impaired</b> awareness. This study investigated the association between <b>impaired</b> awareness and executive functioning, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress with a sample of 30 adults with ABI. A sub-sample of 17 individuals with <b>impaired</b> awareness participated in an intervention where they received feedback of their brain scan findings. The main finding of the study was that measures of <b>impaired</b> awareness and emotional distress decreased following the feedback intervention. No evidence of a statistically significant relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness and mood, or <b>impaired</b> awareness and executive functioning was found. There was a trend towards poor planning ability being related to unrealistic goal setting. Recommendations for further research in this area of neuropsychology and neurorehabilitation are made...|$|R

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly <b>impairing</b> the flavour.|$|E

Yet it is difficult for Visually <b>Impaired</b> people to get employment, and also difficult to adapt to the workplace when a person becomes Visually <b>Impaired.</b> The purpose of the study is to explore how those who become Visually <b>Impaired</b> adapt to their work environment. In exploring these adaptations, the research aims to discover, firstly, if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> are doing the jobs they want to and how they go about doing so. Secondly, to discover which technology, equipment, support and training is helpful in aiding the VI in the workplace. Thirdly, to discover if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> person feels normal if physical and social barriers in the workplace are removed. And lastly, if the Visually <b>Impaired</b> do adapt to the workplace after they become Visually <b>Impaired.</b> The physical and social barriers a Visually <b>Impaired</b> person faces at work, the emotional adaptation that needs to be made when Visual Impairment sets in, the adaptive technology and equipment that assist the Visually <b>Impaired</b> at work, as well as the legislation relevant to the Visually <b>Impaired</b> worker are discussed. The qualitative approach is used as the method of research as the objective of the study is to understand the experience of those becoming Visually <b>Impaired</b> and adapting to their workplaces from within their own environments. Data was collected by means of interviews from five participants, and case studies written to describe their experiences. Comparisons were drawn to assist in analyzing the participants’ experiences. A number of assumptions were then made about Visually <b>Impaired</b> people, as a number of possible issues came to light that the majority of Visually <b>Impaired</b> people might experience in some way or other, {{as a result of the}} similarities in the experiences of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> participants. The following assumptions were made: The Visually <b>Impaired</b> do adapt to the work environment. The Visually <b>Impaired</b> must make certain adaptations to cope at work under their new circumstances. Adaptive technology and equipment, training and support are necessary and helpful to the Visually <b>Impaired</b> in the workplace. Some of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> participants are doing jobs they want to do, and others are not. Some Visually <b>Impaired</b> people feel normal and have always feel normal; others need physical and social barriers removed, to feel normal; and yet others would feel normal if they could have those things they took for granted before, back. The positive reaction of colleagues, clients and managers depends on two things: their knowledge of the Visually <b>Impaired</b> and the Visually <b>Impaired</b> person’s attitude to life and his/her impairment. Most Visually <b>Impaired</b> people need and can find some form of meaningful activity in their lives. Copyright 2002, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved.
