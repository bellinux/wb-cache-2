25|$|In general, type-safety and memory-safety <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> For example, a {{language}} that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed {{as if it were}} valid memory of any type.|$|E
25|$|For Wesley, {{good works}} were {{the fruit of}} one's {{salvation}}, not {{the way in which}} that salvation was earned. Faith and good works <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> in Methodist theology: a living tree naturally and inevitably bears fruit. Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of eternal security, believing that salvation can be rejected. Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.|$|E

25|$|The Reichstag was {{dissolved}} in June 1878 because it refused Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Law. Chancellor Bismarck {{in the newly}} elected parliament relied on a broad agro-conservative majority with the slogan: Agriculture is owed by the state the same attention as industry; if both do not <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> the strength of one will not suffice for a lack in the other. Bismarck helped foster support from these conservatives by enacting several tariffs protecting German agriculture, and incidentally industry, from foreign competition.|$|E

U.S. companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric (PG) have partnered with Habitat for Humanity to provide complete solar grids for a few homes.

The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> especially during {{the first years of the}} Empire, when the city continued to flourish.

25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border {{trade and the}} demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E

500|$|Up to {{that point}} a {{manufacturer}} of solid-state pre-/power- amplifier separates, Naim Audio wanted an entry-level integrated amplifier to complement their range and widen their appeal.

500|$|Johnson's {{term in the}} House expired March 3, 1819, but by August, he had {{returned}} to the state legislature where he helped secure passage of a law that abolished imprisonment for debtors in Kentucky. In December 1819, he resigned his post in the state legislature to fill the Senate seat vacated by the resignation of John J. Crittenden. He was re-elected to a full term in 1822, so that in total, his Senate tenure ran from December 10, 1819 to March 4, 1829. In 1821, he introduced legislation chartering Columbian College (later The George Washington University) in Washington, D.C. During this time period, his views on Western expansion were clear. He believed that [...] the US [...] "empire of liberty" [...] should extend across the continent, arguing in debates leading up to the Missouri Compromise that western expansion and emancipation should <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> acknowledging issues with white racism but advocating for gradual emancipation. Furthermore, he went against the ideas put forward by sympathizers of the Colonization movement, arguing in [...] "favor of meaningfully incorporating people of color into a multiracial empire." ...|$|E
500|$|Wisden noted Willis' {{achievements}} against Australia in 1977, {{stating that}} [...] "the new-ball fire power of Bob Willis, which yielded 27 wickets, was of special significance in England's high summer of success. No England bowler of authentic speed can boast a comparable record {{in a home}} series against Australia". In continued: [...] "It was singularly appropriate that team and personal triumph should <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> for few players have given such loyal and unstinted service to England as the wholehearted Willis... Happily determination is one virtue Willis does not lack, and his re-emergence as a top ranking fast bowler was well and truly deserved." [...] Across all first-class matches that year, Willis had taken 65 wickets at 18.41, {{the most of any}} season of his career. His 35 List-A wickets was also the second highest he would achieve for a season behind the 45 of 1983. Wisden also praised him for refusing to partake in Kerry Packer's World Series cricket, and proclaimed him a Wisden Cricketer of the Year along with Botham, Hendrick, Alan Jones and Ken McEwan.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{nears the}} end with [...] "Where Do We Go from Here?", as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing {{different}} directions. As they sing [...] "Understand we'll <b>go</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's hands {{away in a}} piece of what Whedon calls [...] "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the [...] "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing [...] "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of Gone with the Wind. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.|$|E

In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule and all it entails.|$|E
