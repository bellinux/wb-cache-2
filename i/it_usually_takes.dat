5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E

The Dragon Summoning was later replaced by World Events at March 2014.|$|R
25|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{are given}} by hypodermic injection {{as they are}} not absorbed reliably through the intestines. Live attenuated polio, some typhoid, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel. While vaccination provides a lasting effect, <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> several weeks to develop, while passive immunity (the transfer of antibodies) has immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> me an {{hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx {{against the back of the}} chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is the {{formation}} of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. <b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.|$|E

25|$|While other {{keyboards}} generally associate one {{action with}} each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since {{there are many}} combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' stenotype machines use chorded keyboards {{to enable them to}} enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.|$|E

50|$|The {{event is}} named after Lutetia (in French, Lutèce), a Gallo-Roman city located {{on the site of}} what is now Paris. The first version was {{established}} in 1864, and <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>took</b> place in the spring. Its conditions varied, but in its later years it was a 2,400-metre race for horses aged three or older. It continued to be staged until 1968.|$|R

The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. [...] <b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.|$|E
500|$|The Voigt-Kampff {{machine is}} a fictional {{interrogation}} tool, originating from the novel. The Voigt-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by blade runners {{to determine whether}} an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement {{in response to questions}} dealing with empathy. (Tyrell states: [...] "Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?") In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes [...] "six or seven" [...] questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Ride" [...] was filmed in Miami and the Florida Keys in August 2006. It was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, {{the director of the}} previous single's video, [...] "Unfaithful". In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it back a little bit. I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... <b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> years to learn, but we got it done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot." [...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A worm is {{a device}} used to remove unspent powder bag {{remnants}} from a cannon or {{other piece of}} muzzle-loading field artillery. <b>It</b> <b>usually</b> <b>took</b> {{the form of a}} double corkscrew-shaped piece of iron {{on the end of a}} long pole that could be twisted down the barrel to pick up any debris left over from the previous firing of the weapon. <b>It</b> was <b>usually</b> turned twice before being pulled out.|$|R

500|$|Nobuo Uematsu's usual {{influences}} include Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon and Garfunkel, and Elton John. In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not {{prefer to use}} multiple sources to find MIDI instruments—"I could be {{coming up with a}} great melody in the very moment"—instead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game".|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I {{think it will be a}} shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but <b>it</b> <b>usually</b> <b>takes</b> until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E
25|$|From {{their origins}} as horse-drawn hot lunch carts, diners had evolved {{during the early}} 20th century into stationary, yet movable, {{fixtures}} of the developed urban landscape of the urban Northeast.
