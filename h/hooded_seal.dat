5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and <b>hooded</b> <b>seal.</b> Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E

Ringed seals were once the main staple for food, and have been used for clothing, boots, fuel for lamps, as delicacy, containers, igloo windows, and in harnesses for huskies. Though no longer used to this extent, ringed seals are still an important food and clothing source for the people of Nunavut. Called nayiq by the Central Alaskan Yup'ik people, the ringed seal is also hunted and eaten in Alaska.|$|E
500|$|Mother {{pinnipeds}} {{have different}} strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals remain on land or ice and fast during their relatively short lactation period–four {{days for the}} <b>hooded</b> <b>seal</b> and five weeks for elephant seals. The milk of these species consist of up to 60% fat, allowing the young to grow fairly quickly. In particular, northern elephant seal pups gain [...] each day before they are weaned. Some pups may try to steal extra milk from other nursing mothers and gain weight more quickly than others. Alloparenting occurs in these fasting species; while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{fundamental}} to studies of seal ecology and especially to any understanding of their role as predators in the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem. <b>Hooded</b> <b>seals</b> (Cyostophora cristata) {{are one of the}} largest of the northern phocids and are abundant in the north Atlantic and Arctic seas, but very little quantitative data is available on their feeding behaviour and dietary preferences. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the diet of <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> in Newfoundland waters. [...] Otoliths of six common prey species, determined from a previous study on diet of <b>hooded</b> <b>seals,</b> were used to determine fish length / weight - otolith length / height regressions. For all species except Greenland halibut, the strongest correlations between otolith size and fish length / weight were established using maximum otolith length. For Greenland halibut, maximum otolith height gave a better correlation with fish length and weight. Least squares linear equations were used to derive fish length for Arctic cod, Atlantic herring and capelin, while second order polynomial models were used for Greenland halibut, redfish spp., and Atlantic cod. Fish weight estimates were derived using power (log - log) models for all six fish species. [...] Stomach contents of 67 <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> collected from inshore and offshore waters off Newfoundland were examined to determine the types of prey eaten by <b>hooded</b> <b>seals.</b> The majority of stomachs (73 %) came from the nearshore region along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and were taken in April. Over half of the samples collected were female (64. 2 %). [...] Fourteen prey groups were identified in stomachs (10 fish, 4 invertebrate). The relative importance of prey, expressed as the percent total wet weight of prey recovered, indicated that Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) was the most important species, followed in order of importance by redfish (Sebastes spp.), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), squid (Gonatus spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). [...] Using otoliths from a previous study and from this study, lengths and weights of fish were estimated from a total of 72 stomachs. <b>Hooded</b> <b>seals</b> fed mainly on fish of 25 - 35 cm length for the larger species, and 15 - 25 cm for the smaller ones. Fish consumed by seals caught incidentally from offshore trawlers were larger than those taken elsewhere. The estimated lengths, and proportions (% weight) of fish found per stomach did not differ significantly between male and female <b>hooded</b> <b>seals.</b> [...] The proportions (percent weight) of redfish and Atlantic herring consumed by <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> were significantly larger in the summer months, whereas a higher proportion of Arctic cod was consumed in the winter months. No seasonal differences were found in actual lengths of fish eaten. [...] Total energetic values for fish eaten were calculated from estimated wet weights and energy densitites (kJ/g). Greenland halibut, Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod had the highest average energetic values (kJ), followed by redfish, Arctic cod, capelin and squid. Relative contributions of prey, expressed as the percent total energy of prey recovered, showed that Greenland halibut contributed approximately 53 % of the total energy consumed, followed by redfish, Atlantic herring, Arctic cod, squid, Atlantic cod and capelin. These proportions corresponded with those obtained from percent total wet weight of prey recovered. [...] The relative abundance of the fish species has a strong influence on the composition of the food in the diet of <b>seals.</b> <b>Hooded</b> <b>seals</b> spend some time in areas that are exploited by commercial fisheries, and consume commercial fish species of commercial size. However, in order to evaluate the impact of local predation on individual fish stocks, more information on behavioural and physiological characteristics of seals and fish are needed...|$|R

5000|$|The West Ice {{is a major}} {{breeding}} ground for seals, especially harp <b>seals</b> and <b>hooded</b> <b>seals.</b> It was discovered in the early 18th century by British whalers. At the time, whalers {{were not interested in}} seal hunting as long as there was ample stock of bowhead whales in the area. However, after the 1750s, the whale population had been depleted in the area, and systematic seal hunting started, first by British ships and then by German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and Russian ships. The annual catches were 120,000 animals around 1900, mostly by Norway and Russia, and rose to 350,000 by the 1920s. They then declined, first because of imposed restrictions on total allowable catch and then in response to decreasing market demand. Nevertheless, the seal population in the West Ice was rapidly falling, from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1956 to 100,000 in the 1980s. In the 1980s-1990s, takings of harp seals totaled 8,000-10,000, and annual catches of <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> totaled a few thousand between 1997 and 2001.

40|$|With the {{exception}} of relatively brief periods when they reproduce and moult, <b>hooded</b> <b>seals,</b> Cystophora cristata, {{spend most of the}} year in the open ocean where they undergo feeding migrations to either recover or prepare for the next fasting period. Valuable insights into habitat use and diving behaviour during these periods have been obtained by attaching Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) to 51 Northwest (NW) Atlantic <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> (33 females and 18 males) during ice-bound fasting periods (2004 - 2008). Using General Additive Models (GAMs) we describe habitat use in terms of First Passage Time (FPT) and analyse how bathymetry, seasonality and FPT influence the hooded seals' diving behaviour described by maximum dive depth, dive duration and surface duration. Adult NW Atlantic <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> exhibit a change in diving activity in areas where they spend > 20 h by increasing maximum dive depth, dive duration and surface duration, indicating a restricted search behaviour. We found that male and female <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> are spatially segregated and that diving behaviour varies between sexes in relation to habitat properties and seasonality. Migration periods are described by increased dive duration for both sexes with a peak in May, October and January. Males demonstrated an increase in dive depth and dive duration towards May (post-breeding/pre-moult) and August-October (post-moult/pre-breeding) but did not show any pronounced increase in surface duration. Females dived deepest and had the highest surface duration between December and January (post-moult/pre-breeding). Our results suggest that the smaller females may have a greater need to recover from dives than that of the larger males. Horizontal segregation could have evolved as a result of a resource partitioning strategy to avoid sexual competition or that the energy requirements of males and females are different due to different energy expenditure during fasting periods...|$|R

40|$|How animals {{change their}} {{movement}} patterns {{in response to}} their environment is a central topic in ecology. The northwest (NW) Atlantic <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> occupy areas on the borderline between the North Atlantic- and high Arctic Ocean. By investigating these large predators’ movement patterns through the marine landscape, we can obtain {{a better understanding of}} the seasonal dynamics of habitat selection and use. This will improve the knowledge needed for good ecosystem management of critical habitat. This is especially important for highly vulnerable regions increasingly exposed to the oil and shipping industry, as well as global warming. NW Atlantic <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> rely on ice for two months of the year, when they reproduce and moult (March and July). Factors that influence the distribution at other times of the year are unknown. Here, 67 <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> (33 females, 18 males and 16 juveniles) were equipped with Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) during the breeding or moulting season in the period 2004 - 2008. The study revealed that seals used areas of high topographic relief during migration. Such areas include the Labrador shelf, Davis Strait and Baffin Bay during the post-moult/pre-breeding period (August-February) and the area off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Flemish Cap, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the southeast Greenland shelf during the post-breeding/pre-moult period (April-June). They exhibit sexual and age related segregation in terms of environmental habitat variables (sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll concentration, bottom depth, bottom topography and ice concentration) and first passage time (FPT) at the area restricted search (ARS) scale. Furthermore, males and females demonstrated differences in diving strategies and fluctuations in the relative change of buoyancy over time. Females used areas with greater water depths than males and displayed an off-shelf, dynamic habitat use while males spent more time on top of the shelf and in areas of high topographic relief. I suggest that <b>hooded</b> <b>seals</b> exhibit a resource partitioning strategy to avoid competition between sexes, or that the geographic segregation and different patterns of timing and magnitude of lipid energy acquisition reflect a difference in energy requirements in relation to fasting periods...|$|R
