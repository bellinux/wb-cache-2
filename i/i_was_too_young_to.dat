500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> be serious, I wanted to be part of it... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E
500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

5000|$|Also in 1956, he {{appeared}} on Broadway as the Duke of Aumerle in Richard II. In 1959, Brett had a singing role as the romantic lead of Archie Forsyth in the West End musical Marigold. Also in 1959, he played the part of Hamlet, however on reflection, in a BBC2 television documentary Playing the Dane, Brett later said that [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very good as Hamlet. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> intellectually. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> philosophically. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Byronic. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very handsome. <b>I</b> had qualities, but I'd much rather see other people's version. I wasn't convinced by me". The respected theatre critic Harold Hobson wrote of Brett's portrayal that [...] "the incestuous bed was the centre of his performance". He played many classical roles on stage, including about a dozen Shakespearean parts at the Old Vic, in New York and four while Brett {{was a member of}} the National Theatre Company from 1967 to 1970.|$|R

60|$|I {{was now in}} a way to be {{provided}} for; for though I was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law, yet as my case came to be known, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> do any work, being not above three years old, compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order some care to be taken of me, and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the place.|$|E
60|$|The captain, who {{was made}} desperate by his danger, resolving {{to clear the}} ship of his enemies, tried us all, {{and we were all}} {{condemned}} to die.

6000|$|Resolved not to {{be caught}} a second time in such a humiliating {{position}} by a Democrat, I asked my father that night what the Tariff was. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> understand it, he said. I was to take his word for it that the country {{would go to the}} dogs if the Democrats got in and the Tariff were taken away. Here, in a nutshell, though neither he nor I realized it, was the political instruction of the marching hordes. Theirs not to reason why. I was too young, they too ignorant. Such is the method of Authority! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, uncle," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "I {{have come}} to look on these things a little differently. Many years ago, in America, I used to wonder {{what it was that}} kept you apart from every one else, kept the smile from your lips, made you accept good fortune or ill without any sign of feeling. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} then, but I realise everything now. I know how you denied yourself to send me to school and college. I know how you left yourself almost a beggar when you gave me the chance of my life and trusted me with all your savings. These things I shall never forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} in colors when I was a girl," [...] she went on, indulging many {{obituary}} memories as the gondola dipped and darted down the canal, [...] "and I was married in my mourning for my last sister. It did {{seem a little}} too much when she went, Mr. Ferris. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> feel it so much about the others, but we were nearly of the same age, and that makes a difference, don't you know. First a brother and then a sister: it was very strange how they kept going that way. I seemed to break the charm when I got married; though, to be sure, there was no brother left after Marian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My husband!" [...] she cried. [...] "Why how old do {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to have a husband. I {{had never thought of}} such a thing. Korak was--why--," [...] and now she hesitated, too, for she never before had {{attempted}} to analyse the relationship that existed between herself and Korak--"why, Korak was just Korak," [...] and again she broke into a gay laugh as she realized the illuminating quality of her description.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{subsequent}} releases, his style changed {{as he turned}} from the blues to traditional folk music. In a 2000 interview, Koerner said, [...] "I finally decided <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not a blues guy. How could <b>I</b> <b>be?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and <b>too</b> white, all that shit. So I took a year off and when I started playing again, I treated the subject in general as folk music. It's a new culture; it's not music being made on a back porch anymore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Shank, I {{would not}} let him get the length of that. I told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to--to think about such matters at all, {{and said that he}} must not speak to me again in such a way. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so surprised, flurried, and distressed, that I don't clearly {{remember}} what I said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell me that}} he was dead--to let him {{live out}} the rest of his poor life in exile and alone! Did they think that I didn't care? Cecil," [...] she exclaimed, {{suddenly}} turning and facing him, [...] "I always loved my father! You may think that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> remember him--I wasn't, I loved him always. When I grew up and they told me of his disgrace I was bitterly sorry, for I loved his memory--but it made no difference. And all the time it was a weak, silly lie! They let him come out, poor father, without a friend to speak to him and they hustled him out of the country. And I, whose place was there with him, never knew!" ...|$|E
60|$|We worked our {{way up to}} London, {{with the}} tides, and were carried into London dock; where we discharged. This was {{my first visit to}} the modern Babylon, of course; but I had little {{opportunity}} of seeing much. I had one or two cruises, of a Sunday, in tow of Cooper, who soon became a branch pilot, in those waters, about the parks and west end but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> learn much, or to observe much. Most of us went to see the monument, St. Paul's, and the lions; and Cooper put himself in charge of a beef-eater, and took a look at the arsenals, jewels and armoury. He had a rum time of it, in his sailor rig, but hoisted in a wonderful deal of gibberish, according to his own account of his cruise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> {{think about}} such things," [...] she reflected. [...] "Besides, I {{used to be}} sorry for them, sometimes. But these men at the steel mills--I can't tell you what I feel about them. The sight of their great bodies and their red, sullen faces brought home to me the cruelty of life. Did you notice how some of them stared at us, {{as though they were}} but half awake in the heat, with that glow on their faces? It made me afraid--afraid that they'll wake up some day, and then they will be terrible. I thought of the children. It seems not only wicked, but mad to bring ignorant foreigners over here and make them slaves like that, and so many of them are hurt and maimed. I can't forget them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If the {{troubles}} break out again, I shall hasten back, Francois; indeed, I {{think that in}} any case I shall return for a while, ere long. I do not see what I could do at home.

'I <b>am</b> afraid, dear, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young.</b> <b>I</b> don't mean {{in years}} only, but in experience, and thoughts, and everything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> such a silly little creature! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid {{it would have}} been better, if we had only loved each other as a boy and girl, and {{forgotten}} it.
