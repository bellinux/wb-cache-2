50|$|Air lift uses {{compressed}} air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It {{is also found}} in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a <b>foot</b> <b>valve</b> {{at the bottom of the}} string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the pressurized bellows valve that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{investigated}} the effects of soot contaminated lubricants of engine components. A thorough background review demonstrated that soot related wear is a major issue for the automotive and lubricants industry. A {{detailed analysis of the}} physical properties and effects of soot contaminated lubricants highlighted that there are associated effects that will tend to reduce engine perfonnance and efficiency. The actual wear that was produced is studied for the area of the engine which is most significantly affected by soot contamination, the valve train. A typical elephant's <b>foot</b> to <b>valve</b> tip contact, known to suffer from soot related wear, fonned the basis of the specimen ball-on-flat reciprocating wear testing. A standardised wear test rig and method were developed for the testing, which investigated different lubricants (base and fonnulated oil), increasing levels of soot contamination (using carbon black as a soot surrogate) and different temperatures. The results demonstrated significant increases in wear with increasing level of carbon black contamination. Furthennore, increased temperature tended {{to increase the amount of}} wear produced and using a fonnulated lubricant reduced the amount of wear measured when compared to tests using base oil. Significant changes in wear mechanism were visible from surface imaging ofthe wear scars, showing initially lubricated sliding, which changes to abrasion at higher contamination levels, and then shifting to contact starvation as the contamination significantly reduces the flow of lubricant into the contact at very high contamination levels. Significantly, the severity of the effects of soot contamination was due to the lubricant film thickness in the contact and therefore ultimately the lubrication regime within which it is operating. Where boundary lubrication is significantly affected by soot contaminated lubricants, but these effects are reduced when the contact operates under elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication conditions. A region of the engine that is significantly affected by soot contaminated oil is the contact between the piston and the cylinder wall or liner. This is mainly due to the component's proximity to the area where soot in produced. Wear will occur in this highly sensitive region due to the breakdown of the protective oil film, which will occur when the lubricant is contaminated with soot. A method of analysing the effect sO~as been investigated 'using an ultrasonic technique to measure the oil film between a piston and a cylinder wall or liner. The ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement technique (developed at the University of Sheffield) has been used in many static and dynamic applications; therefore an initial trial was performed on a single cylinder engine, demonstrating some success. A motored test engine was then built on which to develop the technique and to provide a platform for future research. The test engine demonstrated potential for future success, as a variety of ultrasonic transducers were tested. Testing also highlighted that significant future work, regarding reducing electrical interference, improving the data processing electronics and further investigations into the different types of transducer is required to improve the technique.

40|$|Over {{seven million}} Americans suffer from Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), a painful and {{debilitating}} disease {{that affects the}} superficial and deep veins of the legs. Problems associated with CVI include varicose veins, bleeding, ulcerations, severe swelling, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, which may lead to death. The presence of CVI results from damaged (incompetent) one-way vein valves in leg veins. These valves normally allow forward flow of blood to the heart, and prevent blood from pooling at the <b>feet.</b> However, incompetent <b>valves</b> allow reflux of blood, causing clinical problems. There are few effective clinical therapies for treating CVI. Vein valve transplantation is a surgical option for treatment. However, {{it is often difficult}} to find suitable donor valves. Very few prosthetic valves developed in the past have demonstrated sufficient clinical or mechanical functionality. Persistent problems include thrombus formation, leaking valves, and valves that do not open at physiologic pressure gradient. The primary objective of this research was to develop a clinically relevant functional prosthetic vein valve. The novel prosthetic valve is flexible, biocompatible, has low thrombogenecity, and is easy to manufacture. It was designed to address well-defined consumer needs and functional design requirements. The valve was required to 1) withstand 300 mmHg of backpressure with leakage less than 1. 0 mL/min, 2) open with a pressure gradient less than 5 mmHg, and 3) meet criteria 1 and 2 after 500, 000 cycles of operation. The valve met these design requirements in bench testing. The valve can open with a pressure gradient of 2. 6 0. 7 mmHg, and can withstand 300 mmHg with leakage less than 0. 5 mL/min. The valve remained functional after opening and closing over 500, 000 times. The valve presented in this research is operationally functional, and is a potential solution for treating venous incompetence in CVI patients. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. David N.

By analysis and experiment it is shown that greatly improved performance is achieved by permitting the water column to rebound freely...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum brake systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the <b>foot</b> pedal (treadle <b>valve</b> plunger). The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Mechanisms of venous outflow {{from the}} leg and foot {{have not been}} clearly defined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the anatomy and physiologic mechanism of the plantar venous plexus and its impact on venous drainage from the tibial veins. Methods: Fifty phlebograms that contained complete foot and calf films were reviewed. On lateral films, the number of veins in the plantar venous plexus and its tibial outflow tract were counted. The length and diameter of the longest vein in the plantar venous system and the length of the foot arch were measured. The ratio of the length of the plantar venous plexus to the arch length was calculated. The presence or absence of valves within the plexus was recorded. Plantar venous plexus outflow was evaluated by an duplex ultrasonographic scan of the posterior tibial, anterior tibial, and peroneal veins during intermittent external pneumatic compression of the plantar surface of the foot. Results: The plantar venous plexus was composed of one to four large veins (mean, 2. 7 veins) within the plantar aspect of the foot. The diameter of these veins was 4. 0 ± 1. 2 mm. The veins coursed diagonally from a lateral position in the forefoot to a medial position at the level of the ankle, spanning 75 % of the <b>foot</b> arch. Prominent <b>valves</b> were recognized within the plantar veins in 22 of 50 patients. The plexus coalesced into an outflow tract of one to four veins (mean, 2. 5 veins) that flowed exclusively into the posterior tibial venous system. Small accessory veins that drained the plantar surface of the forefoot flowed into either the posterior tibial or peroneal veins. This pattern of selective drainage of the plantar venous plexus was confirmed by duplex imaging. Mechanical compression of the plantar venous plexus produced a mean peak velocity in the posterior tibial veins of 123 ± 71 cm/sec, in the anterior tibial veins of 24 ± 14 cm/sec, and in the peroneal veins of 29 ± 26 cm/sec. Conclusions: The plantar venous plexus is composed of multiple large-diameter veins that span the arch of the foot. Compression of the plantar venous plexus, such as that which occurs during ambulation, is capable of significantly increasing flow through the posterior tibial venous system into the popliteal vein. Its function may be integral to venous outflow from the calf and priming of the more proximal calf muscle pump. (J Vasc Surg 1996; 24 : 819 - 24. ...|$|R
40|$|Contexto: La primera idea que tuvieron los cirujanos (1902) para evitar amputaciones por isquemia fue la de desviar el flujo {{arterial}} al sistema venoso por intermedio de una fístula arteriovenosa entre vasos adyacentes, pero con resultados inciertos. Desde entonces se han inventado las simpatecomias, las endarteriectomias y los injertos puentes o bypass y, últimamente, otros avances médicos, quirúrgicos y endovasculares. Sin embargo, en el mundo se siguen haciendo amputaciones, sobre todo en diabéticos. La arterialización de las venas del pie, basada en la vieja idea de la circulación invertida, constituye una esperanza más para estos pacientes ya condenados a la pérdida del miembro. Objetivo: Demostrar que la arterialización de las venas del pie en diabéticos con lesiones neuroisquémicas, generalmente infectadas (pie diabético), es un método eficaz y durable, aunque el puente solo funcione temporalmente. Pacientes y método: De enero de 2000 a febrero de 2009, 59 pacientes con pie diabético fueron tratados por arterialización de las venas del pie. Un deceso precoz no ha sido contabilizado. De los 58 pacientes restantes, 44 fueron hombres y 14 mujeres, con edad promedio de 71 años: (53 - 91 años), 54 en estado IV de Fontaine y cuatro en estado IIIB. La arterialización fue hecha con un injerto venoso invertido anastomosado, proximalmente en una arteria con buen flujo (ilíaca externa, femorales o poplítea) distalmente en la vena marginal interna del pie, con destrucción de las válvulas de las venas del dorso. Resultados: De los 58 arterializados, 12 fueron fracasos por trombosis precoz, siendo amputados, y 46 fueron éxitos (79 %) : seis de corto, 12 de mediano y 28 de largo plazo. En los grupos que se ajustan a la definición de éxito (dos) hubo 38 trombosis tardías del puente (95 %) y cuatro recidivas de la sintomatología isquémica. No ha habido ningún caso de sobrecarga cardíaca ni de várices. Conclusión: La arterialización en el pie diabético es posible, eficaz y durable, gracias, posiblemente, a la inducción de una neoarteriogénesis y neoangiogénesis, que mantiene los beneficios aun después de que el puente se haya ocluido (función temporal). Background: The first idea of surgeons (1902) {{to avoid}} amputations due to ischemia was to deviate the arterial {{flow to the}} venous system using an arteriovenous fistula between adjacent vessels; however, the results were unreliable. Since then, sympathectomies, endarterectomies and bypasses have been created, and more recently, other medical, surgical, and endovascular advances have been used. However, amputations continue to be performed worldwide mainly in diabetic patients. The arterialization of the foot veins, based on the old idea of inverted blood flow, is a new possibility for these patients who, otherwise, could lose their limbs. Objective: To demonstrate that arterialization of the foot veins in diabetic patients with neuroischemic lesions, usually infected (diabetic foot), is an effective and long-lasting method, even though the bypass only works temporally. Patients and method: From January 2000 to February 2009, 59 patients with diabetic foot were threated by means of arterialization of the foot veins. An early death {{was not included in}} the analysis. Of the 58 remaining patients, 44 were male and 14 were female. Their mean age was 71 years old: (53 - 91 years). Fifty-four of them were classified as being Fontaine IV and four were IIIB. The arterialization was conducted using an inverted venous graft proximally anastomized to an artery presenting good flow (external iliac, femoral or popliteal arteries) distally in the internal marginal vein of the <b>foot,</b> eliminating the <b>valves</b> of the <b>foot</b> arch veins. Results: Of the 58 patients who underwent arterialization, 12 failed due to early thrombosis, having amputated limbs, and 46 succeeded (79 %) : six at short-term, 12 at medium-term, and 28 at long-term. In the groups who were considered to have a successful outcome (two), there were 38 late bypass thrombosis (95 %) and four relapses of the ischemic symptoms. There was no case of heart overload or varices. Conclusion: The arterialization of the diabetic foot is possible, effective and long-lasting probably thanks to the induction of a neo-arteriogenesis and neo-angiogenesis that maintain the benefits even after the bypass has occluded (temporal function) ...|$|R
30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} at {{vertical}} {{position of the}} jet pump {{the efficiency of the}} pump decreases if the depth of the pump is decreased. It also shows that the discharge flow rate increases when depth is increased. A 10 % increase in flow caters to 15 % increase in head over the pump. This is explained as with larger head it provides larger length of the pipe which carries kinetic energy of the fluid for longer time. Hence, jet pump works better at higher depth and deliver large amount of fluid. At this condition, the corresponding increase in suction flow rate is of order of 30 – 38 %. This means that at greater depth in this case 15 % increase the force due to buoyancy make the valve opening easy accommodating larger flux of fluid to get in. This leads to 6 to 7 basis point increase in efficiency from its base point. Likewise, the efficiency and discharge flow rate curiously have nearly the same magnitude at horizontal position and vertical position. It is because once the flow commences through the <b>foot</b> <b>valve,</b> of the two components: vertical and horizontal flows, one component of flow becomes zero while the other is active. But when the jet pump is at 450 both the component remains and there is less fluid loss. This ensures that efficiency is marginally better for 450 at greater depth. In this case it is around 4 % better. All throughout the experiment, the injection rate is kept constant so its influence is not accounted here with. Nevertheless, it is expected that at larger injection power the above outcome will be magnified.|$|E
40|$|The Interim Stabilization Project is {{responsible}} for removing pumpable interstitial liquid from remaining single shelled tanks and transferring the waste to safer double-shelled tanks. This waste transfer is conducted by installing a saltwell pumping system within the designated single shell tank, and transferring the waste to double shelled tank using approved transfer lines. The saltwell pumping system is placed within a saltwell screen installed into the tank waste, the screen is designed to allow gravity flow of liquid into the screen and prevent solids from entering the pumping system. A <b>foot</b> <b>valve</b> consisting of a venturi jet and nozzle creates a suction, picking up waste at an equal rate as the out flow transfer rate of the saltwell system. A centrifugal pump is used to create the motive force across the eductor and drive the waste through the associated system piping and transfer lines leading to the double shelled tanks.

5000|$|A non-rigid armored vessel (#27) was {{designed}} that would withstand {{the rigors of}} most landings and preserve the air sample of approximately [...] It consisted of three nested cylinders of flexible materials that, from the outside to the inside, were: a tough outer layer of plasticized nylon; an intermediate layer of woven nylon with very high tear strength, and; an innermost cylinder of polyethylene film that {{would serve as a}} gas barrier for the air sample. At takeoff the armored vessel hung in a deflated form around the steel cable (#27) and below an open parachute (#23) that would provide braking of the system descent if the rate exceeded about 2000 feet per minute. Launching of this complex balloon system required special handling techniques, and the entire process was referred to as a platform launch, a novel concept developed by Harold E. Froehlich, principal engineer of the Balloons and Meteorological System Group. In this form of launching the load train, nearly 300 ft in length, was laid out on a ground cloth-covered runway with the lowest part of the load train in the upwind direction. The uppermost part of the system, the top of the lifting balloon, would be in the downwind direction. A heavy platform was positioned at a point toward the top of the lifting balloon, and the balloon material would pass over the platform and be securely held in place by a large horizontal padded roller about four feet in length. The helium inflation tube was located in the upper portion of the lifting balloon so that the helium source would inflate the section of the balloon beyond the platform. Since the system would be ascending to 80000 ft in altitude, only about 3% of the maximum balloon volume was filled with helium. The inflation took place by metering in an amount of helium lifting gas that would equal the gross weight of the system plus typically about 5% of ‘free lift’ to ensure that the system would ascend at an appropriate rate at the launching. Launching was initiated by releasing the padded roller on the launch platform. The ascending balloon would then sequentially pick up {{the lower part of the}} lifting balloon, the deployed parachute and armored vessel, the uninflated envelope, and lastly the heavy insulated bag containing the controller, blower, instruments, telemetering equipment and power supply. There were variations of this procedure that evolved to facilitate the launching. For example, the heavy instrument bag and blower assembly was eventually mounted on the front of a vehicle that drove under the balloon system as it ascended during launching, and the bag was released from the vehicle using small explosive devices. [...] Grab Bag flights were typically launched early in the morning and recovered during daylight hours of that same day. The ascent time to 80000 ft was usually about three hours. As the balloon system approached the ceiling altitude, the excess lift (referred to as [...] "free lift") that drove the system upward on launching filled out a duct system of the lifting balloon, and helium was automatically vented from the lifting balloon and slowed the ascent. As this process continued, the balloon system slowly ascended to the ceiling altitude and was in equilibrium, the lift of the helium balloon just balancing the total weight of the system. If this process took place as designed, about thirty minutes were needed to assure that the system was stable at the ceiling altitude of 80000 ft. If the system instruments indicated that the altitude was not changing, the blower attached to the sample envelope balloon at the base of the system was initiated by the controller. The effect of turning on the blower was almost immediately evident in the appearance of the sample balloon. Viewing the system through a tracking telescope clearly showed the sample envelope beginning to fill out. The sample gathering process typically required of the order of an hour or so to be completed, the appearance of the system then being of two balloons, one immediately on top of the other. The blower was then turned off by the controller and a valve closed that sealed the sample envelope from the outside. The autopilot was then activated by the controller, releasing helium from the lifting balloon (#116) and initiating a descent of the entire system. In practice, the descent of the system did not become apparent for of the order of an hour after the autopilot was activated. This was because the sample balloon, now containing a large volume of air, would generate lift with any descent due to adiabatic heating of the sample air in the isothermal stratosphere. It could require an hour or two to establish a nominal descent rate of the system. The descent to altitudes of the order of 15000 ft could take of the order of two to three hours. At this point the axial fan (#29) was automatically initiated to transfer air in the sample balloon into the armored vessel. This transfer was usually completed before the system reached an altitude of 4 or 5 thousand <b>feet</b> and a <b>valve</b> in the armored vessel valve just above the axial fan (#25) was sealed by the controller. As the system continued to descend and touched down, explosive cutters fired to release the lifting balloon from the lower part of the system and the armored vessel fell the short remaining distance, perhaps fifty feet, to the ground. Usually the recovery crew was at the landing site and immediately began the process of transferring the air sample from the armored vessel into high-pressure bottles for transfer to another laboratory for analyses. A series of six test flights were carried out in the Grab Bag development program in which various system elements were examined. The seventh flight would be the first attempt to capture the first air sample at 80000 ft in the Minneapolis area in mid-August 1953. The six test flights carried out tests of various system components, and included: tests and further development of the launching procedure for this complex system; an evaluation of the system controller; adequacy of the power supply and the autopilot function; a study of the blower function at altitude to evaluate both its function and the volume of air delivered into the sample balloon as compared to the laboratory results; evaluation of the process in which the axial fan transferred the air sample from the sample balloon into the armored vessel and the vessel was sealed; and in each case, further development of logistics for system launching and recovery.|$|R
