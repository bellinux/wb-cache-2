We conclude that no single paradigm or visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues. We also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms themselves.

40|$|This study {{examines}} analyst information intermediary roles using a textual analysis of analyst reports and corporate disclosures. We employ a topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research {{to compare the}} thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings conference calls with {{the content of the}} calls themselves. We show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those from conference calls and interpret topics from conference calls. In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant <b>information.</b> <b>Analyst</b> interpretation is particularly valuable when the processing costs of conference call information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to analyst report content that simply confirms managers’ conference call discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate disclosures and by clarifying and confirming corporate disclosures...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} levels of annual report voluntary disclosure and the market reaction to the next interim earnings announcement in a market with both low regulation and analyst following. We examine the first order effects of voluntary disclosure by using direct measures for both the level of voluntary disclosure, and the market effects of such disclosure. The results show that preannouncement voluntary disclosure significantly reduces the price and volume reactions in the earnings announcement period, and {{is consistent with the}} Kim and Verrecchia (1991 a) framework and the Atiase and Bamber (1994) empirical findings. We extend the analysis to investigate trading behavior during the earnings announcement period, and observe the trading behavior predicted by Kim and Verrecchia (1991 b, 1994). We conclude that voluntary disclosure in annual reports can be regarded as an important determinant of preannouncement information precision in markets with low regulation and analyst following, and observe the expected trading behavior as modeled in Kim and Verrecchia (1991 a), and extended in Kim and Verrecchia (1991 b, 1994).

40|$|Purpose This paper briefly {{outlines}} {{a development}} programme {{designed to improve}} the skills of NHS <b>Information</b> <b>Analysts</b> and assesses the extent these skills have been developed. There are significant opportunities for the NHS to utilise information more effectively, and Analysts have a key role. However, training opportunities prior {{to the development of}} this programme have been limited for this professional group. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the potential benefits to the organisations, patients and the NHS as a whole,that improvements in the quality of analysis can deliver. Design/methodology/approach The authors compared pre-course and post-course self-assessment of skill levels of Analysts who attended the programme. The authors also considered general feedback and comments from participants. Findings All of the 40 skills areas assessed demonstrated an increase in mean competency score. In cohorts 1 and 2, 38 of these were statistically significant (p < 0. 001 - 0. 041, mean increase in score 1. 0). For cohorts 3 - 5, 37 were statistically significant (p < 0. 001 - 0. 012; mean increase 1. 2). These findings were supported by the positive feedback from participants. Practical implication The programme develops skills for NHS <b>Information</b> <b>Analysts</b> which can improve the quality of analysis in the NHS, offering significant potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare. Originality/value The Information Analysts’ Development Programme provides the only training programme available for NHS <b>Information</b> <b>Analysts,</b> contributing to the development of data driven service improvement within the NHS.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for the identification of an organization's intellectual capital (IC) for decision support and providing important managerial insights in knowledge-intensive industries. In traditional approaches, identification of an organization's IC is usually done manually through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc. These methods are labor and time intensive {{and the quality of}} the results is highly dependent on, among other things, the experience of the investigators. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Intellectual Capital Extraction (KBICE) algorithm which incorporates the technologies of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic processing of unstructured data and extraction of important IC-related information. The performance of KBICE was assessed through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and encouraging results have been obtained. The results showed that, through the use of hybrid intelligent matching strategies, it is possible to extract commonly referred IC-related information from unstructured data automatically. IC <b>information</b> <b>analyst</b> can rely on this method as an additional mean to identify and extract the commonly sought IC information from financial reports in a fast, systematic and reliable manner.

40|$|Group {{membership}} can impact significantly on {{the risk}} exposure {{of a firm}} but the evaluation of aggregate features {{is more complex than}} the individual analysis of each member, requiring the support of an <b>information</b> <b>analyst</b> able to define judgment that considers also the inter-group relationships and to access to private information collected directly from the group. Rating agencies do not make independent estimates of group ratings, with respect to the rating of the individual group entities, and, in many cases, they do not disclose this information to the market. This paper examines the relationship between ratings of groups and individual group entities, with a view to assessing the effects of change to the group structure on the rating. The analysis focuses on the financial sector and is limited to the Italian market, which has been characterized in recent years by a strong trend towards concentration. The results achieved by analysing the rating processes by the main international agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s) show that both the ratings of the groups and the group structure adjusted ratings of the individual entities are not at all affected by the occurrence of significant corporate events regarding the group’s structure...|$|E
40|$|Information Technology (IT) {{has always}} been the {{playground}} of technical specialists. In this paper we argue no changes in this respect, but rather that the management of an organisation becomes aware of what the technical specialists are actually doing. This cannot be achieved by teaching tomorrow's managers a few of the technical skills. We see the role of IT in management education as threefold. First, management education in general has to focus on information and knowledge and their influence on management capabilities and possibilities. Building upon this general background, advanced courses should cover the challenges of II and the opportunities and problems on a general management level. Second, a specialisation within management education could be the <b>information</b> <b>analyst,</b> who can participate in the analysis and design of business processes and their supporting information systems. The actual construction of these systems is best left to software engineers. Third, another kind of specialisation within management should be the functional specialist with in-depth informational knowledge. In this area one can position experts in financial or logistic systems. In an attempt to capture the future course of information and knowledge education, the developing field of knowledge management is introduced briefly. Finally, the consequences of our analysis for management education are discussed...|$|E
