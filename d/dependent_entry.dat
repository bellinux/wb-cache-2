40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} non-isothermal {{effects on}} disposal {{of carbon dioxide}} into a saline aquifer. Carbon dioxide storage in the subsurface could be {{an important part of}} the present climate control initiative to reduce the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere. Layer of water-bearing permeable rock is assumed as a saturated porous medium, and the contained water can be replaced by compressed carbon dioxide. In such environment, water vapor flow can be developed from the thermal gradient caused by geothermal energy. High injection pressure is required to remove the fluid already present in the pores of solid skeleton hence accurate density calculation is important. So we use an extended ideal gas law to calculate the compressed carbon dioxide gas density. Temperature <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> pressure is accounting the surface tension and wetting angle role on the sorption equilibrium. Governing equations for numerical simulations are: mass balance equations for each component, i. e., water, vapor and carbon dioxide; energy balance equation. We have used a combined monolithic and staggered coupling scheme to solve these equations numerically using an automatic time stepping scheme. The numerical model is implemented into an open source in-house scientific finite element code allowing for simulations of applications in various geotechnical areas...|$|E

The properties and molecular identity of these channels are now under intense investigation. It is speculated that mammalian proteins belonging to the TRP-related family take part in either receptor- and store- <b>dependent</b> <b>entry,</b> though data linking the specific TRP proteins and any endogenous Ca 2 +- channel are very scarce. Thus we aimed to study the role of TRPC 3 {{in the formation of}} receptor- and store- operated calcium entry pathways in A 431 cells. Both whole-cell current recordings and fluorescent measurements of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration have shown that partial inhibition of TRPC 3 expression with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) suppresses the store-dependent Ca 2 + entry, but does not affect the receptor-mediated Ca 2 + entry. The investigations on the single-channel level revealed that TRPC 3 suppression leads to the disappearance of one of the types of store operated Ca 2 +- channels in the plasma membrane and appearance of a new type of a store-independent channel in it. It might indicate that TRPC 3 protein is needed for the functioning of store-dependent channel in A 431 cells...|$|E
40|$|Positively-charged {{amino acids}} are located at {{specific}} {{positions in the}} envelope glycoprotein E 2 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) : two histidines (H) and four arginines (R) in two conserved WHY and one RGERCDLEDRDR motifs, respectively. Additionally, the E 2 hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) is rich in basic amino acids. To investigate the role(s) of these residues in HCV entry, we subjected to comparative infection and sedimentation analysis cell culture-produced (HCVcc, genotype 2 a) wild type virus, a panel of alanine single-site mutants and a HVR 1 -deletion variant. Initially, we analyzed {{the effects of these}} mutations on E 2 -heparan sulfate (HS) interactions. The positive milieu of the HVR 1, formulated by its basic amino acids (key residues the conserved H 386 and R 408), and the two highly conserved basic residues H 488 and R 648 contributed to E 2 -HS interactions. Mutations in these residues did not alter the HCVcc-CD 81 entry, but they modified the HCVcc-scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> and the neutralization by anti-E 2 or patients IgG. Finally, separation by density gradients revealed that mutant viruses abolished partially or completely the infectivity of low density particles, which are believed to be associated with lipoproteins.

40|$|Purpose: The human cornea is {{a primary}} target for herpes simplex virus- 1 (HSV- 1) infection. The goals {{of the study were}} to {{determine}} the cellular modalities of HSV- 1 entry into human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Specific features of the study included identifying major entry receptors, assessing pH dependency, and determining trends of re-infection. Methods: A recombinant HSV- 1 virus expressing beta-galactosidase was used to ascertain HSV- 1 entry into HCE cells. Viral replication within cells was confirmed using a time point plaque assay. Lysosomotropic agents were used to test for pH dependency of entry. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry were used to determine expression of three cellular receptors- nectin- 1, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), and paired immunoglobulin-like 2 receptor alpha (PILR-a). The necessity of these receptors for viral entry was tested using antibody-blocking. Finally, trends of re-infection were investigated using viral entry assay and flow cytometry post-primary infection. Results: Cultured HCE cells showed high susceptibility to HSV- 1 entry and replication. Entry was demonstrated to be pH dependent as blocking vesicular acidification decreased entry. Entry receptors expressed on the cell membrane include nectin- 1, HVEM, and PILR-α. Receptor-specific antibodies blocked entry receptors, reduced viral entry and indicated nectin- 1 as the primary receptor used for entry. Cells re-infected with HSV- 1 showed a decrease in entry, which was correlated to decreased levels of nectin- 1 as demonstrated by flow cytometry.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycemia aggravates ischemic brain damage. Since catecholamines {{increase}} hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{resulting in}} hyperglycemia, we investigated whether norepinephrine and dopamine elevate arterial blood glucose, thereby increasing pericontusional cortical glucose and lactate concentrations and brain edema in brain-injured rats. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study. SUBJECTS: Male Sprague Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Physiological saline solution, norepinephrine, or dopamine were infused intravenously for 90 min beginning 4. 5 h after inducing a focal cortical contusion. Blood glucose, lactate, and pericontusional cortical extracellular glucose and lactate were determined before, during {{and up to}} 60 min after the infusion period. Thereafter brains were removed to assess hemispheric water content. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Continuous norepinephrine and dopamine infusion significantly increased pericontusional glucose concentrations, being mostly sustained by norepinephrine (NaCl: 1. 3 +/- 0. 2, dopamine: 2. 7 +/- 0. 2, norepinephrine: 4. 8 +/- 1. 1 mM). While arterial blood glucose was only significantly elevated in norepinephrine-treated rats from 8. 6 +/- 0. 6 to 12. 6 +/- 1. 6 mM, the extracellular to blood glucose ratio was significantly increased in dopamine- and norepinephrine-treated rats (0. 28 +/- 0. 01 and 0. 38 +/- 0. 05 vs. 0. 17 +/- 0. 01). Plasma and pericontusional lactate remained unchanged, and brain edema was similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Norepinephrine and dopamine significantly increased pericontusional glucose concentrations which did not elevate extracellular lactate and aggravate underlying posttraumatic edema formation. In addition to possibly increased facilitated endothelial glucose transport, the elevated extracellular to blood glucose ratio suggests a passive concentration- and pressure- <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> via a damaged blood-brain barrier.

40|$|The {{transport}} of l-methionine by the gram-positive species Brevibacterium linens CNRZ 918 is described. The one transport system (Km = 55 μM) found is constitutive for l-methionine, stereospecific, and pH and temperature <b>dependent.</b> <b>Entry</b> of l-methionine into cells {{is controlled by}} the internal methionine pool. Competition studies indicate that l-methionine and α-aminobutyric acid share a common carrier for their transport. Neither methionine derivatives substituted on the amino or carboxyl groups nor d-methionine was an inhibitor, whereas powerful inhibition was shown by l-cysteine, s-methyl-l-cysteine, dl-selenomethionine and dl-homocysteine. Sodium plays important and varied roles in l-methionine transport by B. linens CNRZ 918 : (i) it stimulates transport without affecting the Km, (ii) it increases the specific activity (on a biomass basis) of the l-methionine transport system when present with methionine in the medium, suggesting a coinduction mechanism. l-Methionine transport requires an exogenous energy source, which may be succinic, lactic, acetic, or pyruvic acid but not glucose or sucrose. The fact that l-methionine transport was stimulated by potassium arsenate {{and to a lesser extent}} by potassium fluoride suggests that high-energy phosphorylated intermediates are not involved in the process. Monensin eliminates stimulation by sodium. Gramicidin and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone act in the presence or absence of Na+. N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercurobenzoate, valinomycin, sodium azide, and potassium cyanide have no or only a partial inhibitory effect. These results tend to indicate that the proton motive force reinforced by the Na+ gradient is involved in the mechanism of energy coupling of l-methionine transport by B. linens CNRZ 918. Thus, this transport is partially similar to the well-described systems in gram-negative bacteria, except for the role of sodium, which is very effective in B. linens, a species adapted to the high sodium levels of its niche...|$|E
40|$|The {{balance between}} latent and {{productive}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection {{is the result of}} a complex interplay of viral and host factors. In the first part of this study I investigated a group of 6 HIV+ haemophilic long term nonprogressor~ (LTNP) for maintenance of functional defects of their HIV-I nefgene. Our results showed that Nef alleles from these nonprogressor hemophiliacs are defective in enhancing virus replication and CD 4 down-regulation. This was not predictive of disease outcome as 3 out of the 6 individuals studied progressed later to full HIV disease. The primary viral isolates from these the 3 'late progressors' showed an extension of gpl 20 Env <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> co-receptor use from CCR 5 only to CCR 5 /CXCR 4, a known correlate of disease progression, while the non I f progressors maintained monotropic CCR 5 use. In addition to viral genes, several pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated in HIV infection influence HIV latency and replication via activation of cellular transcription factors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV+ individuals frequently show a constitutive activation of the cytokine-related Janus kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAKISTAT) pathway, and particularly of a C-terminally truncated isoform of STAT 5 (STAT 5). I investigated whether STAT 5 and STAT 5 ~ could affect HIV transcription and replication. STAT 5 induced HIV transcription driven by the long terminal repeats (LTR). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and related molecular assays showed that STAT 5 ~ actually bound to the HIV LTR and suppressed viral transcription and expression. Thus, a key finding from the present thesis is that the constitutiveIy activated STAT 5 ~ present in the leukocytes of most HIV-positive individuals acts as a negative regulator of HIV expression. Thus, both viral factors, such as the evolution of gp 120 Env coreceptor use towards CXCR 4 in individuals maintaining functional nef mutations, and host transcription factors, including STAT 5 /STAT 58, regulate HIV- I replication in vitro and, likely, its pathogenicity in infected individuals.

IC cells were distinguished from col-lecting duct (CD) cells by a relatively low basolateral mem-brane potential (VB), a higher fractional apical membrane re-sistance, and apparent high Cl- conductances of the basolat-eral membrane. Two functionally different subtypes of IC cells in the CCD were identified based on different responses of VB upon reduction of the perfusate Cl- from 120 to 12 mM: the basolateral membrane of f-IC cells was hyperpolarized, whereas that of a-IC cells was unchanged. This is {{in accord with the}} hypothesis that the apical membrane of 6 l-IC cells contains some Cl [...] <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> processes, possibly a Cl-/ HCO 3 exchanger. Further characterization of electrical prop-erties of both subtypes of IC cells were performed upon lower-ing bath or perfusate Cl- from 120 to 12 mM, and raising bath or perfusate K+ from 5 to 50 mM. A 10 -fold increase in the perfusate K+ had no effect on Va in both subtypes of IC cells. Upon abrupt changes in Cl- or K+ concentration in the bath, a large or a small depolarization of the basolateral membrane, respectively, was observed in both subtypes of IC cells. The electrical properties of a- and f 8 -IC cells were similar among the distal nephron segments, but their distribution was differ-ent: in the CNT, which consists of IC cells and CNT cells, 97. 3 % (36 / 37) of IC cells were of the f, type.

40|$|Microfold (M) {{cells are}} known {{specialized}} intestinal epithelial cells that internalize particulate antigens and can {{aid in the}} establishment of immune responses to enteric pathogens. While certain enteric viruses have been observed within M cells, not much is understood about whether viruses in general use M cells to initiate a productive infection. Noroviruses (NoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses that infect their host via the fecal-oral route. Murine NoV (MNV) infects intestinal macrophages and dendritic cells of its host and provides a tractable experimental system for understanding how an enteric virus interacts with the intestinal epithelium. This dissertation focuses in the mechanism of how MNV breaches the intestinal epithelial barrier to get in contact with its permissive cells for a productive infection. Using an in vitro transwell model of polarized intestinal epithelial cells, I demonstrated that MNV crosses the cell monolayer in the absence of viral replication or disruption of tight junctions. Additionally, this MNV transport was mediated by a subset of cells in the monolayer with functional M cell properties also termed as M-like cells. In vivo, replication of two divergent MNV strains was reduced in mice depleted of M cells and similar findings were made using reovirus, an enteric double-stranded RNA virus that infects intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, since residual MNV viral titers were still present, perhaps due to an incomplete depletion of M cells, two different genetically M cell deficient mouse models were used for MNV infection studies: Rag 2 -/-γc-/- and RANKfl/flVillin-Cre mice. Results in both mouse models, show that oral MNV infection is greatly reduced when compared to controls and to our previous conditional M cell depletion model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that M cells are required for MNV pathogenesis. Similar findings were observed for reovirus. Interestingly, preliminary results suggest that, in the large intestine, alternate entry mechanisms (e. g. transepithelial dendritic cells or villous M cells) could take place for MNV infection in a virus-strain dependent way. Further examination into potential alternative MNV-strain <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> mechanisms still needs to be performed, but this dissertation has laid a framework for future studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chemokine receptors (CKRs), the {{primordial}} receptors for primate lentiviruses, are sufficient to mediate virus-cell fusion. Several different fusogenic CKRs and related receptors provide a broad potential host cell range, presumably advantageous for viral spread {{within a given}} infected individual, and across species. By contrast, the additional constraint of obligatory CD 4 binding, just prior to CKR engagement, radically restricts potential host cells within an individual (or lymph node microenvironment), and might also limit xenotransmission, as CD 4 sequences vary among primates. In spite of these potential drawbacks, CD 4 <b>dependent</b> <b>entry</b> for SIV and HIV is the rule rather than the exception, and is generally thought to have evolved by selection for 1) stabilization of virus–cell surface interactions, and 2) conformational shielding of readily neutralized CKR binding epitopes. CD 4 binding residues of SIV and HIV envelope are recessed, (relatively hidden from immune detection) and may exhibit a strong degree of automimicry, thus benefitting from self tolerance. Documented evolution, within individual macaques, of neutralization-resistant CD 4 -dependent SIV, derived from CD 4 -independent inocula, supports these ideas, but does not explain CD 4 ’s exclusive role as the penultimate receptor-even more striking, given the wide diversity of CKRs and other surface molecules that can serve as actual fusion receptors for SIV. We, therefore, explored the additional, non-exclusive, hypothesis that surface CD 4 on leukocytes is a marker of a more favorable host cell environment, as compared to CD 8, NK, or B cell surface markers. Results We demonstrate progressive in vitro evolution of two SIV strains to CD 4 -dependence (and CXCR 4 tropism) in normal human PBMCs (hPBMCs). The two CD 4 -independent strains of SIV tested developed nearly complete CD 4 dependence over several months of serial passage in hPBMCs, correlating with {{a limited number of}} non-synonymous env region mutations, some previously reported to be determinants of CD 4 -dependency. The initial ability of SIV stocks to grow to significant (albeit, relatively low) levels in CD 4 (−), CD 14 (−) cells was also lost with long term passage. Rapid emergence and subsequent prominence of G[*]→[*]A and A[*]→[*]G mutations within env regions associated with CD 4 dependence was seen. Conclusions Progressive acquisition of strict CD 4 tropism, independent of immunoselection, supports the idea that surface CD 4 identifies optimal host cells having intracellular environments most favorable to viral replication. The prominence of mutations involving G to A, or A to G, suggests that APOBEC 3 mediated infidelity may facilitate rapid switching of cell surface receptor usage within SIV swarms encountering fluctuating availability of optimal CD 4 + CKR + targets. These observations of non-immune selection are compatible with, and may accelerate, simultaneous selection for previously described CD 4 -dependent neutralization resistance in vivo. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{provide a}} {{rigorous}} and asymptotically exact {{expression of the}} mutual information of translationally invariant free fermionic lattice systems in a Gibbs state. In order to arrive at this result, we introduce a novel framework for computing deter-minants of Töplitz operators with smooth symbols, and for treating Töplitz matrices with system size <b>dependent</b> <b>entries.</b> The asymptotically exact mutual information for a partition of the one-dimensional lattice satisfies an area law, with a prefactor which we compute explicitly. As examples, we discuss the fermionic XX model in one di-mension and free fermionic models on the torus in higher dimensions in detail. Special emphasis is put onto {{the discussion of the}} temperature dependence of the mutual in-formation, scaling like the logarithm of the inverse temperature, hence confirming an expression suggested by conformal field theory. We also comment on the applicability of the formalism to treat open systems driven by quantum noise. In the appendix, we derive useful bounds to the mutual information in terms of purities.

40|$|Determining {{the total}} {{variation}} mixing time of Kac's random {{walk on the}} special orthogonal group SO(n) has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we construct a novel non-Markovian coupling for bounding this mixing time. The analysis of our coupling entails controlling the smallest singular value of a certain random matrix with highly <b>dependent</b> <b>entries.</b> The dependence of the entries in our matrix makes it not-amenable to existing techniques in random matrix theory. To circumvent this difficulty, we extend some recent bounds on the smallest singular values of matrices with independent entries to our setting. These bounds imply that the mixing time of Kac's walk on the group SO(n) is between C_ 1 n^ 2 and C_ 2 n^ 4 (n) for some explicit constants 0 < C_ 1, C_ 2 < ∞, substantially improving on the bound of O(n^ 5 (n) ^ 2) by Jiang. Our methods may also be applied to other high dimensional Gibbs samplers with constraints and thus are of independent interest. In addition to giving analytical bounds on the mixing time, our approach allows us to compute rigorous estimates of the mixing time by simulating the eigenvalues of a random matrix...|$|R
40|$|Approximate {{message passing}} (AMP) is {{a class of}} {{efficient}} algorithms for solving high-dimensional linear regression tasks where one wishes to recover an unknown signal β_ 0 from noisy, linear measurements y = A β_ 0 + w. When applying a separable denoiser at each iteration, the performance of AMP (for example, the mean squared error of its estimates) can be accurately tracked by a simple, scalar iteration referred to as state evolution. Although separable denoisers are sufficient if the unknown signal has independent and identically distributed entries, in many real-world applications, like image or audio signal reconstruction, the unknown signal contains dependencies between entries. In these cases, a coordinate-wise independence structure {{is not a good}} approximation to the true prior of the unknown signal. In this paper we assume the unknown signal has <b>dependent</b> <b>entries,</b> and using a class of non-separable sliding-window denoisers, we prove that a new form of state evolution still accurately predicts AMP performance. This is an early step in understanding the role of non-separable denoisers within AMP, and will lead to a characterization of more general denoisers in problems including compressive image reconstruction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove the {{universality}} of covariance matrices of the form H_N× N=X^†X where X is an M× N rectangular matrix with independent real valued entries x_ij satisfying Ex_ij= 0 and Ex^ 2 _ij= 1 /M, N, M→∞. Furthermore {{it is assumed that}} these entries have sub-exponential tails or sufficiently high number of moments. We will study the asymptotics in the regime N/M=d_N∈(0,∞),_N→∞d_N≠ 0,∞. Our main result is the edge universality of the sample covariance matrix at both edges of the spectrum. In the case _N→∞d_N= 1, we only focus on the largest eigenvalue. Our proof is based on a novel version of the Green function comparison theorem for data matrices with <b>dependent</b> <b>entries.</b> En route to proving edge universality, we establish that the Stieltjes transform of the empirical eigenvalue distribution of H is given by the Marcenko-Pastur law uniformly up to the edges of the spectrum with an error of order (Nη) ^- 1 where η is the imaginary part of the spectral parameter in the Stieltjes transform. Combining these results with existing techniques we also show bulk universality of covariance matrices. All our results hold for both real and complex valued entries.
