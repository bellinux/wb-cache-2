25|$|A player's {{choice of}} which scale to {{use is a}} <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> {{of the scope of}} the game to be played. For {{historical}} games, 15mm seems to be the most popular scale, because it is small enough to allow for large battles. Smaller scaled miniatures are typically mounted in groups and moved as groups. This creates the visual effect of a large mass of combatants, allowing games simulating platoon, company, battalion, and even corps level actions. In these cases, the miniatures are often mounted on trays, or bases, for ease of mass movement.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky differentiates competence, {{which is}} an {{idealized}} capacity, from performance being the production of actual utterances. According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge {{of his or her}} language and it is the 'mental reality' which is responsible for all those aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'. Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data. Therefore, he claims that a fundamental distinction has to be made between the competence and performance.|$|E
25|$|Hip hop {{music has}} spawned dozens of subgenres which {{incorporate}} hip hop music production approaches, such as sampling, creating beats, or rapping. The diversification process {{stems from the}} appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups. There are many varying social influences that affect hip hop's message in different nations. It is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political and/or social injustices. In South Africa the largest form of hip hop is called Kwaito, which has had a growth similar to American hip hop. Kwaito is a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of a post apartheid South Africa and is a voice for the voiceless; a term that U.S. hip hop is often referred to. Kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle, encompassing many aspects of life, including language and fashion.|$|E

25|$|The work {{is unique}} in the period because of Mary's swoon; her {{collapse}} echoes the pose of her son, {{as far as to}} the two figures that hold her as she falls. This pose was entirely new for Early Netherlandish art. The sentiment, however, is a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of the mystical devotion expressed by Thomas à Kempis' popular treatise The Imitation of Christ, first published in 1418. The text, just as the image here, invites the reader or viewer to personally identify with the suffering of Christ and Mary. The doctrines of Denis the Carthusian also emphasized the significance of the Virgin Mary and her belief in Christ at the moment of his death. Denis expresses the conviction that the Virgin Mary was near death when Christ gave up his spirit; Van der Weyden's painting powerfully conveys this idea.|$|E
25|$|Other centurions: Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one {{to command}} each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the {{backbone}} of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage.|$|E
25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic Water core of the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard there is quite a lot of freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic core of the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal. The Atlantic Water core temperature is a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of the depth of the Svalbard Branch of the WSC.|$|E

Other electronic advances included the use of Faraday cages and electronics with high input impedance, so that the [...] measurement itself did not affect the voltage being measured.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{framework}} of the city consists of two large semicircles about [...] in diameter. The city {{was designed as a}} circle about [...] in diameter, leading it {{to be known as the}} [...] "Round City". The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first. Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. In the center of the city lay the mosque, as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of the traditional Persian Sasanian urban design. The Sasanian city of Gur in Fars, built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.|$|E

Feminists also hold that the weak institutional arrangements in place to address consequences of sexual violence, as well as unfair treatment of the victims (or survivors, an alternatively proposed terminology) are <b>direct</b> <b>reflections</b> {{of the ways in which}} society regards men, women and the sexual relations between them. Furthermore, feminist critique has led to a closer convergence between feminism and psychology in the study of sexual violence.|$|R
40|$|Introspective {{judgments}} {{are often used}} in linguistics to obtain information about speakers’ mental representations of language. This chapter addresses two questions, namely: what shapes speakers’ judgments, and what such judgments provide information about. I argue that speakers’ {{judgments are}} influenced by their theories of language, which in turn are partly shaped by our experience with written language. The fundamental units that linguists use in their analyses – phonemes, words, and sentences – are largely products of a particular written tradition; and grammaticality judgments about isolated sentences are, to a considerable extent, judgments about what is acceptable in written language. Thus, linguistic intuitions are not <b>direct</b> <b>reflections</b> of mental representations of linguistic knowledge, but of speakers’ sensitivity to socially constituted norms...|$|R
2500|$|Ruiz’s view on racialization is nuanced, as she {{proves the}} {{whiteness}} of Californios {{to create a}} gap between Californios and laboring Mexicans, Indians, and blacks. Furthermore, the disdain of Indians from the Californio’s {{point of view is}} discussed which indicates the hierarchy of class, intelligence, and importance. Californios appear to be the middle man in sense of racial hierarchy because the strive to embraced by the Anglo community is apparent, but unachievable which also applies to the Indians. This “conscious drive towards assimilation… reveals Mexican American particularity” and calls for readers to “ of basic analytic categories such as… nations and nationalism.” When taking into account Ruiz’s descriptions of the body, this work strays away from the Mexican American particularity and towards dismodernity. Dismodern “relies on the malleability of the human body and identity.” It “emphasizes physical difference and disability as unifying, ethical norm from whence new subjective categories and political identities will emerge,” and argues for “an ideology of interdependent bodies enjoying a symbiotic relationship with technology.” When one views Ruiz’s work as a Latino dismodern, the “frailty of characters’ bodies is a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of the frailty of the nation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the year}} 1848, McCord {{published}} {{her first book}} of poetry. My Dreams, a collection of fugitive poems, from the press of Carey & Hart, Philadelphia. A close study of these poems reveals a genuine poetic talent, {{but there is not}} the certainty of maturity, not the metrical perfection of first-rate poetry. The lyrist is an honestly doubting lyrist in many passages. There are a number of them that are either of adolescent composition, withheld until 1848 for publication, or at least of adolescent conception, possibly worked over for this volume. Hope is the keynote of a majority of the poems in this collection; but in many instances the hope is unaccompanied by any certainty of faith which a woman of McCord's full life and wide experience must have developed at the time this collection was published. A few of the poems are narrative myths, a <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of her classic temperament. They suggest early Greek myths, and meet the reader with such titles as [...] "The Daughters of Hope," [...] who are cleverly personified as Fancy and Happiness, and, Happiness being lost in Life's confusion, Fancy assists her mother, Hope, to chase Happiness through all time. Others included [...] "The Falling Star," [...] "Love, Wisdom, Folly," [...] "The Comet," [...] "The Star That Followed Me," [...] "Conduct of the Sources of Good and Evil," [...] "The Home of Hope" [...] and [...] "The Voice of a Star." [...] Then there is a grouping possible among them of simple narratives of the world of concrete things. For example, the pathetic [...] "Poor Nannie" [...] and [...] "The Blood Stained Rose," [...] "The Birth of the Evergreens" [...] and [...] "Pretty Fanny." [...] But it is in the third division of these poems that McCord's maturity expresses her feelings, and in the poems of this group that deal with the eternal riddle of life and death. They suggest the suffering spirit. [...] "My Dream Child," [...] "The Village Churchyard," [...] "The First Beam of Light," [...] "My Dead," [...] "Ye're Born to Die" [...] and others are found here. Probably the best among them is [...] "The Voice of Years." ...|$|E
