The 1953 tournament featured only three teams that played all of their games: Sweden, West Germany, Switzerland. Sweden finished the tournament undefeated and won their first World Championship.|$|E

Atlético eliminated Paraguayan side Cerro Corá on penalties in the first round, and Bolivia's Jorge Wilstermann in the quarterfinals with a 41 aggregate score. In the semi-finals, Atlético faced Rosario Central {{for a third time}} in continental football, and was eliminated after a 11 draw at the Gigante de Arroyito and a 10 defeat at home. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the club participated in the Copa CONMEBOL, as the competition's final edition was played in 1999, and Atlético did not qualify.|$|E

5|$|In 1924–25, {{after the}} Metropolitans folded {{and the rest}} of the PCHA merged with the WCHL, Holmes joined the Victoria Cougars. In his first season with the Cougars, Holmes posted a 16–12 regular season record, with three shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the WCHL playoffs, Holmes was undefeated in four games. He had two wins and ties each, with one shutout and a 1.75goals-against average. In the Stanley Cup final, Holmes posted a 3–1 record with a 2.00goals-against average against the Montreal Canadiens. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup. It was Holmes' fourth and last Stanley Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E
5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that Alexander would be {{in direct contact with}} his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E

5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he would yield under pressure.|$|E
5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|In Caernarfon's {{case the}} walls of the town and castle {{remained}} in good condition, while features which required maintenancesuch as roofswere in a state of decay and much timber was rotten. Conditions were so poor that of the castles seven towers and two gatehouses, only the Eagle Tower and the King's Gate had roofs by 1620. The domestic buildings inside the castle had been stripped of anything valuable, such as glass and iron. Despite the disrepair of the domestic buildings, the castle's defences were in a good enough state that during the English Civil War in the mid-17thcentury it was garrisoned by Royalists. Caernarfon Castle was besieged three times during the war. The constable was John Byron, 1st Baron Byron, who surrendered Caernarfon to Parliamentarian forces in 1646. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> Caernarfon Castle saw fighting. Although it was ordered in 1660 that the castle and town walls should be dismantled, the work was aborted early on and may never have started.|$|E
5|$|The {{track and}} field venue opened in 1973, with a {{capacity}} for 6,000 people. The following year Lillehammer IF moved from Sportsplassen i Lillehammer to Stampesletta, with the old venue being retired in 1975. In 1977, Stampesletta hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the championships were held on gravel, and this caused problems because excessive rain drowned the venue, and the fire department had to pump off the water. The club started planning fixed surface on the venue in 1980, and was granted a loan for NOK500,000. On 18 August 1981, the municipal council voted to grant NOK200,000 for the upgrade. The work was largely done with voluntary work, and the new surface was inaugurated on 28 August 1982 with the Norwegian Relay Athletics Championship.|$|E

In 1970, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition following a dispute {{over the use of}} professional players, and the team did not participate in the 1972 or 1976 Winter Olympics. Led by goaltender Vladislav Tretiak and forwards Valeri Kharlamov, Alexander Yakushev, Vladimir Petrov and Boris Mikhailov, the Soviet team won gold at both the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan and 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. In 1971, the United States finished last at the World Championships and was relegated to Pool B. The team qualified for the 1972 Olympics and won silver, making it the first Pool B team to win an Olympic medal. Czechoslovakia won the bronze medal in 1972. In 1976, Czechoslovakia won the silver and West Germany won bronze. Along with Canada, the Swedish team did not participate in the 1976 tournament in protest at their inability to use professional players.|$|E
