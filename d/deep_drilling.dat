The <b>deep</b> <b>drill</b> string was taken about 700 m east of the Camelot Crater in the Taurus-Littrow region of the moon. Three core segments have been chemically characterized from the mainly coarse-grained upper portion of the <b>deep</b> <b>drill</b> string. The chemical data suggest that the entire 70007 - 70009 portion of the <b>deep</b> <b>drill</b> string examined was not deposited as a single unit, but was formed by several events sampling slightly different source materials which may have occurred over {{a relatively short period of}} time. According to the data from drill stem 70007, there were at least two phases of deposition. Core segment 70009 is probably derived from somewhat different source material than 70008. It seems to be a very well mixed material...|$|R

500|$|Borehole drilling: By {{at least}} the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the Chinese used deep {{borehole}} drilling for mining and other projects; The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as 600m (2000ft). K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: [...] "The Chinese method of <b>deep</b> <b>drilling</b> was accomplished {{by a team of}} men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen." [...] This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. [...] "Kicking Her Down"). A Western Han Dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of 100m (328ft) with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders and iron tools. (For further information, see the entry on [...] "natural gas as fuel" [...] below.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 30 years {{following}} the initial discovery of 1914, oil companies spent over $150 million on exploration and development but found no major reserves of note. The provincial government resorted to subsidies and tax relief for companies to encourage further exploration. [...] Imperial Oil alone had drilled 133 wildcat wells throughout the province, all of which failed to yield significant quantities of oil. [...] By the mid-1940s, the company neared the decision of abandoning the search for oil in the province in favour of focusing on the production synthetic gasoline out of natural gas. [...] While {{the majority of the}} company's efforts drilled down only into Cretaceous levels where the Turner Valley strike was discovered, some of Imperial's geologists believed that greater reserves could be found deeper below the earth's surface. They convinced the company's technical committee to attempt one more <b>deep</b> <b>drilling</b> effort. Imperial's board of directors reluctantly supported the new effort, but made it known that this well, initially known as Wildcat No. 134, would be the company's last-chance effort.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938 Price, with a {{group of}} Adventists in Los Angeles, founded what became the Deluge Geology Society (DGS), with {{membership}} restricted to those believing that the creation week was [...] "six literal days, and that the Deluge should be studied as the cause of the major geological changes since creation". Not all were Adventists; early members included the Independent Baptist Henry M. Morris and the Missouri Lutheran Walter E. Lammerts. The DGS undertook field-work: in June 1941 their first Bulletin hailed the news that the Paluxy River dinosaur trackways appeared to include human footprints. Though Nelson had advised Price in 1939 that this was [...] "absurd" [...] and that the difficulty of human footprints forming during the turmoil of the deluge would [...] "knock the Flood theory all to pieces", in 1943 the DGS began raising funds for [...] "actual excavation" [...] by a Footprint Research Committee of members including the consulting geologist Clifford L. Burdick. Initially they tried to keep research secret from [...] "unfriendly scientists". Then in 1945, to encourage backing, they announced giant human footprints, [...] "at a single stroke" [...] defeating the theory of evolution. The revelation that footprints had been carved and an unsuccessful field trip that year failed to dampen their hopes. However, by then the DGS was riven by doctrinal arguments. The most extreme dispute began in late 1938 after Harold W. Clark observed <b>deep</b> <b>drilling</b> in oil fields and had discussions with practical geologists which dispelled the belief that the fossil sequence was random, convincing him that the evidence of thrust faults was [...] "almost incontrovertible". He wrote to Price, telling his teacher that the [...] "rocks do lie in a much more definite sequence than we have ever allowed", and proposing that the fossil sequence was explained by ecological zones before the flood. Price reacted with fury, and despite Clark emphasising their shared belief in literal recent Creation, the dispute continued. In 1946 Clark set out his views in a book, The New Diluvialism, which Price denounced as Theories of Satanic Origin.|$|E
