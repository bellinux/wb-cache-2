40|$|In China, {{the water}} quality of most main lakes and {{catchments}} has been degrading since the 1970 s. Specifically in 2009, {{large areas of the}} water in Huai, Hai and Liao rivers (three main rivers in China) and Taihu, Caohu and Dianchi lakes were of poor quality (below the worst category V), 17. 4 %, 42. 2 %, 36. 1 % 19. 3 %, 62. 5 % and 41. 7 % respectively (China Environmental Protection Bureau, 2009). Furthermore, there is serious eutrophication in 85 % of Chinese lakes with nonpoint sources pollution accounting for approximately 50 % of the total pollutants discharge into the lakes in eastern China (Qin et al., 2007). Industrial discharges and household sewages are the main sources of water pollution in the country (Hays, 2008). While industrial pollution can be treated through technology renovation and controlled by environmental regulations and laws, decreasing household sewage in an efficient and sustainable way relies on the residents themselves. For example, more than 60 % of the total phosphorus in Taihu Lake comes from household sewage and public awareness is essential for ensuring effective environmental improvement and protection (Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, 2011). Not many quantitative studies have been conducted to examine such environmental awareness, particularly the changes in the awareness levels in response to a major environment pollution incident. This paper establishes a system of indicators for the assessment of public awareness. Combined with a fuzzy matter-element analysis method, a model is set up to quantitatively assess public awareness of environmental protection. The model is applied to assess the environmental awareness of the residents of Wuxi city after their major lake Taihu suffered a severe algae bloom in 2007 which can be considered a serious <b>environmental</b> <b>incident.</b> This study aims at examining whether such an <b>environmental</b> <b>incident</b> can affect people’s environmental awareness, and what is its degree of impact on the changes in public awareness of environmental protection in Wuxi.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} {{are becoming increasingly}} severe in China with industrial discharges and household sewages being the main sources of water pollution in the country. For example, {{in the case of}} Taihu Lake, {{more than half of the}} total phosphorus in the lake comes from household sewage. While industrial pollution can be treated through technology innovation and controlled by environmental regulations and laws, decreasing household sewage relies entirely on residents. Raising public environmental awareness therefore is essential for ensuring effective environmental improvement and protection. A quantitative assessment of public awareness can inform policy and decision makers; however, not many such studies have been conducted. Changes in the awareness levels in response to a major environmental pollution incident are of particular interest because of the people’s first-hand experience of the triggered consequences. The present paper establishes a system of indicators for the assessment of public environmental awareness. Combined with a fuzzy matter-element analysis method, a model is set-up to quantitatively assess the public environmental awareness. The model is then applied to assess the environmental awareness of the residents of Wuxi City after its major lake Taihu suffered a severe algae bloom in 2007.

40|$|Drawing on the {{legitimacy}} theory framework, this study introduces an alternative means to spot “fuzzy reporting” signals {{as a way}} to detect greenwashing at the firm level. Its approach is based on the way the sustainability reporting process can mislead stakeholders after critical incidents take place. In order to do so, a single <b>environmental</b> <b>incident,</b> which took place in Colombia, is analyzed in light of what happened before, during and afterwards, with special emphasis on the corporate disclosure process performed by the company involved. Results obtained give support to the assumption that fuzzy reporting can be objectively detected not only through the analysis of annual sustainability reports, but also by tracking other forms of corporate messages when a specific concern is carefully followed. This study’s contribution is two-fold. First, it builds on the theoretical notions of greenwashing and fuzzy reporting by illustrating a practical and objective way to identify some deceiving corporate practices.

Planning for a register of people affected by or exposed to an incident is one of the evolving tools in the public health preparedness and response arsenal. Objective: We compared and contrasted the instigation and design of health registers in the epidemiological response to major <b>environmental</b> health <b>incidents</b> in England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. Design: Consultation with experts from the 5 nations, supplemented with a review of gray and peer-reviewed scientific literature to identify examples where registers have been used. Setting: Populations affected by or at risk from major <b>environmental</b> health <b>incidents</b> in England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. Methods: Nations were compared with respect to the (1) types of major incidents in their remit for considering a register; (2) arrangements for triggering a register; (3) approaches to design of register; (4) arrangements for register implementation; (5) uses of registers; and (6) examples of follow-up studies. Results: Health registers have {{played a key role in}} the effective public health response to major <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents,</b> including sudden chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear, as well as natural, more prolonged incidents. Value has been demonstrated in the early and rapid deployment of health registers, enabling the capture of a representative population. Conclusion: The decision to establish a health register must ideally be confirmed immediately or soon after the incident using a set of agreed criteria. The establishment of protocols for the instigation, design, and implementation of health registers is recommended as part of preparedness activities. Key stakeholders must be aware of the importance of, and protocols for, establishing a register.

The explosions resulted in a huge fire, in which more than 200 dwellings and dozens of commercial buildings were damaged. As a result of the accident, 22 people died and more than 1000 were wounded. On the day of the fire and the days following, RIVM's <b>Environmental</b> <b>Incident</b> Service took a series of samples in the surroundings of the fire to determine the potential exposure of the people involved. Measurements in the smoke, close to the fire, showed high concentrations of particles, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, especially lead, copper and zinc. In a second series of measurements made on the days following the fire only slightly increased concentrations of particles, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds and dioxins were found. Outside the measurement area background concentrations were hardly, if at all, exceeded. Concentrations of asbestos in the air did not exceed the maximum risk level. The data were used to estimate the potential human exposure to toxic compounds on the basis of exposure profiles of the people involved. The estimated exposure was compared to health based guidelines and it was concluded that health effects due to the exposure were highly unlikely, with the exception of short-term irritation of the air ways.

40|$|BACKGROUND—A factory fire in Tranmere, Merseyside, England, {{deposited}} asbestos containing fallout in {{an urban}} area. There was considerable community anxiety for months after the incident. Therefore {{an assessment of the}} long term health risks of this acute <b>environmental</b> <b>incident</b> were requested by the local health authority.  METHODS—The facts of the incident were gathered and appraised from unpublished and press reports, involved personnel, and further analysis of material collected {{at the time of the}} incident. The literature on the long term health risks of asbestos was reviewed, and combined with evidence on asbestos exposure to estimate community health risk.  RESULTS—Risk was almost entirely from exposure to fire fallout of chrysotile in asbestos bitumen paper covering the factory roof. Amosite was only detected in a few samples and in trace amounts. The number of people who lived in the area of fallout was 16   000 to 48   000. From a non-threshold model with assumptions likely to overestimate risk, the lung cancer risk is estimated to be undetectably small. Risk of mesothelioma from chrysotile exposure, and risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from amosite exposure were based on observational studies and were estimated to be even lower than that of lung cancer risk from chrysotile exposure. Academically, there are assumptions that while reasonable cannot be proven, for example, the validity of extrapolating observed risk from much higher exposures to lower exposures, estimates of individual exposure, and that there is no threshold for asbestos to cause cancer.  CONCLUSIONS—The author is unaware of a similar study on long term health risks in a community exposed to asbestos in a fire. It is concluded that, using methods that do not underestimate risk, risk is undetectably small. Practical lessons from this methodology and approach to health risk assessment are discussed.    Keywords: asbestos; environmental pollutants; mesothelioma; health risk assessment; lung cance...|$|E

In this study, the spatial-temporal patterns of <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>incidents</b> in China {{in the period of}} 1995 – 2012 were analyzed, using the Spatial Getis-Ord statistic and an Improved Prediction Accuracy Index (IAPI). The results show that, in this period, the occurrence of <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents</b> exhibited a dynamic growth pattern but then dropped and continued to drop after the year 2006, which was considered a crucial turning point. Not coincidentally, this corresponds to the year when the State Council issued its National Environmental Emergency Plan, and following the examination of major incidents, special actions were taken to strengthen the control of incidents and emergency responses. The results from Getis-Ord General G statistical analysis show that the spatial agglomeration phenomenon was statistically significant after 1999 and that the level of spatial agglomeration was rising, while the Getis-Ord Gi* statistical analysis reveals that <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>incidents</b> were mainly agglomerated in the Pan Yangtze River Delta and Pan Pearl River Delta regions. Accordingly, the spatial-temporal hotspot pattern based on the IAPI values at the provincial scale could be categorized into: stable hotspots, unstable hotspots, and cold-spot areas. The stable hotspots category was further divided into three subtypes: industrial distribution type, industrial transfer type, and extensive economic growth type. Finally, the corresponding measures for sustainable management were proposed: stable hotspots were classified as essential regions requiring the immediate prevention and control of environmental pollution incidents; unstable hotspots were characterized by their need for ongoing and continual prevention measures, and cold-spots were those areas that required strengthened environmental monitoring.

40|$|Quantifying the {{environmental}} impacts of hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania is critical for identifying high risk activities, and informing the development of engineering and policy practices aimed at risk mitigation. Environmental inspection and incident reports issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) are the most complete and consistent dataset available for analyzing trends in <b>environmental</b> <b>incident</b> rates in the Commonwealth. Overall violation and penalty rates decreased statewide between 2008 and 2011 when scaled to the number of Marcellus completions (1. 08 to 14; and. 43 to. 03, respectively). There are regional differences in inspection practices and violation and penalty issuance between PADEP districts: Based on the assumption that intra-company environmental practices are consistent across drill sites, violation and penalty rates should generally be equivalent between PADEP districts for each driller. However, for 4 major gas companies operating in all 4 PADEP districts, the Northwest District Office issued overwhelmingly more violations and penalties than the other district offices in almost every case. Several important regulatory changes impacting Marcellus exploration activities occurred during the study period. Since many of these changes are activity specific, the overall incident rates were not affected. However, penalties for accidental discharges to stream waters declined from. 04 per new completion to. 01, following a regulatory change requiring a 150 foot buffer between drill sites and streams. There is generally an inverse relationship between the number of Marcellus drill site inspections, and the number of violations and fine carrying penalties issued. The number inspections increased statewide from 1195 in 2008 to 10, 192 in 2011, and the rate of violations and penalties per inspection decreased from. 09 to. 02; and. 03 to. 004, respectively. This thesis shows that the relationship between incident reporting, drilling activity, inspection activity, and regulatory changes interact in a dynamic manner. It is recommended that inspection and reporting practices be centralized between PADEP districts, and that incident rates and types continue to be monitored so that regulatory and engineering practices can continue to be targeted to risk bearing activities...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Incident</b> Service of the RIVM has {{measured}} the levels of hazardous airborne compounds and deposited particles at more than fifty major fires. These data have been systematically classified {{with the aim of}} determining the types and levels of hazardous compounds released in fires of specific materials, such as plastics, wood and chemical waste. Literature data from incineration experiments and field measurements carried out near fires were also used. The results of this study are summarized in a concise and practical table that gives the types and amounts of substances, both gaseous and particle bound, released in fires of certain materials. The table can be used by fire brigades and environmental measuring services to determine the appropriate measuring strategy for fires and to make a risk assessment of people exposed to the smoke. The study shows that all fires generate substantial amounts of the common combustion products, including carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and fine particles. Other components are only released from the combustion of specific materials - for example, hydrogen chloride and dioxins from the combustion of polyvinyl chloride. Ambient air concentrations of emitted compounds are always increased downwind of the fire, even up to a few hundred meters from the source. This does not, however, imply by definition that those people exposed run enhanced health risks. At distances of 1 km or more from the fire concentrations are at a normal level, or only slightly elevated. The deposition of particles emitting from fires - with the exception of very large fires or special fires - barely results in any environmental contamination. Measurement data are scarce on a number of compounds that may be formed in a fire and which are potentially risky, such as isocyanates, bromine containing fire retardants, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing PAHs, furans, nitriles, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen fluoride. More insight into the behaviour of these compounds and their emission from fires as well as their impact on both the environment and health of human beings is desired.

Methods: Two hundred ninety-two residents of West Auckland completed questionnaires measuring recent symptoms, negative affect, and concerns about the effects of modernity on health before aerial spraying of their neighborhood with Foray 48 B. After spraying, 181 residents (62 %) returned a follow-up questionnaire measuring symptoms, spray-avoidance behavior, and the perceived effect of the spray program on health. Results: The number of symptoms reported after the spray was most closely related to the number of symptoms reported at baseline (0. 40, p. 0001). Higher levels of modern health worries (0. 23, p. 001) and baseline symptoms (0. 17, p. 05) were associated with a higher number of symptoms being attributed to the spray program.
