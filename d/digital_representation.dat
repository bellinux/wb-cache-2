5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes {{to have a sense of}} grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a <b>digital</b> <b>representation</b> of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
25|$|New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software The {{language}} of New Media {{is based on}} the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on <b>digital</b> <b>representation</b> and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a <b>digital</b> <b>representation</b> on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E

In the current study, we examined the manners in which people touch <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> of people, and compared those behaviors to {{the manner in which}} they touch <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> of nonhuman objects. Results demonstrated that people used less force when touching people than other nonhuman objects, and that people touched the face with less force than the torso area. Finally, male <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> were touched with more force than female representations by subjects of both genders. We discuss the implications of these data to the development of haptic communication systems as well as for a methodology of measuring the amount of copresence in virtual environments...|$|R

The study set out to determine the feasibility of students creating and submitting these <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> for assessment and to identify which of analytical or comparative pairs scoring generated the more reliable scores. This paper proposes that scoring <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> of creative practical work submitted by students is a viable alternative to traditional approaches to assessment...|$|R

For example, if the actual temperature is 23.234456544453 degrees, but if only two digits (23) are assigned to this parameter in a particular <b>digital</b> <b>representation,</b> the quantizing error is: 0.234456544453.

40|$|The {{representative}} fraction, {{the metric}} traditionally used by cartographers {{to characterize the}} level of geographic detail in a map, is not well-defined for digital geographic data.

For <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> of fields six cases can be identified, but in only two cases is there a straightforward solution to the requirements. For <b>digital</b> <b>representations</b> of discrete objects, representative fraction can be replaced with any ordinal index of specification.
