5|$|A {{number of}} Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' {{practice}} specialised in. At this <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> in his career, he produced designs {{in a variety}} of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences of a number of architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce designs in his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.|$|E

The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937; sold to M. Gosselin-Duriez on 30 July 1937 for 3,557,010 FF, she arrived at Dunkirk for breaking up on 31 August.|$|E

5|$|As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool {{were able}} {{to compete in the}} 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.

In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the 1998–99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999–2000.|$|E
5|$|At this <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> {{the term}} punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E

5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, at this <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E

At an <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E
