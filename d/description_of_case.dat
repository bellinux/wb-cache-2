Case II diffusion is characterised by a strong coupling between diffusion and deformation and is highly temperature dependent.

First, semi-holographically coupling free band fermions to holographic dimers, we uncover novel phase transitions between conventional Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids, {{accompanied by a}} change {{in the structure of the}} Fermi surface. Second, we make dimer vibrations propagate through the whole crystal by way of double trace deformations, obtaining nontrivial band structure. In a simple toy model, the topology of the band structure experiences an interesting reorganization as we vary the strength of the double trace deformations. Finally, we develop tools that would allow one to build, in a bottom-up fashion, a holographic avatar of the Hubbard model.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{this study}} had {{the aim of}} {{assessing}} {{the quality of life}} among patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). For this, the SF- 36 and WOMAC questionnaires respectively were used to make comparisons with preoperative values. METHODS: a prospective observational cohort study was conducted, with blinded analysis on the results from 107 TKAs in 99 patients, between June 2010 and October 2011. The present study included 55 knees/patients, among whom 73 % were female and 27 % were male. The patients' mean age was 68 years. The SF- 36 and WOMAC questionnaires (which have been validated for the Portuguese language) were applied immediately before and six months after the surgical procedure. RESULTS: the statistical and graphical analyses indicated that the variables presented normal distribution. From the data, it was seen that all the indices underwent positive changes after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: despite the initial morbidity, TKA is a very successful form of treatment for severe osteoarthritis of the knee (i. e. more than two joint compartments affected and/or Ahlback classification greater than 3), from a functional point of view, with improvement of the patients' quality of life, as confirmed in the present study.
