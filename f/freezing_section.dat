40|$|YesIn this work, a novel {{concept in}} freeze {{desalination}} (FD) was introduced. Nowadays the total {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) production capacity has reached 290 Megatons per year. Its enormous cold energy released from re-gasification {{can be used in}} the freeze desalination process to minimize the overall energy consumption. A process of FD on flake ice maker utilizing LNG cold energy was designed and simulated by HYSYS software. An ice bucket on flake ice maker was chosen as seawater crystallizer mainly due to its continuous ice making and removing ice without heat source. A dynamic model of the <b>freezing</b> <b>section</b> has been developed and simulated through gPROMS software. The results show that the consumption of 1 kg equivalent LNG cold energy can obtain about 2 kg of ice melt water. In addition, it is shown that the power consumption of this LNG/FD hybrid process is negligible...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} column {{crystallization}} at total reflux and steady state was analyzed mathematically and experimentally {{in order to}} determine the mechanisms by which separations are achieved and limited. The results of the study indicate that separation is produced by the formation of crystals in the <b>freezing</b> <b>section</b> and by interphase mass-transfer in the adjacent purification section. The separation is mainly limited by axial eddy diffusion in the liquid phase. Data from three binary chemical systems were used in the study. The first system, m -chloronitrobenzene- m -bromonitrobenzene, forms a solid solution with a small phase separation (less than 6 wt. %) and was the primary subject of this study. The second system, azobenzenestilbene, forms a solid solution with a phase separation which exceeds 20 wt. %. The third system, benzene-cyclohexane, has essentially no solid solubility in the range of compositions for which data on separation have been reported (½ to 3 wt. % cyclohexane). Four mathematical models of column crystallization were developed and compared with experimental data. These models were based on different sets of assumptions as to the mechanisms which control the overall separation. The model which is consistent with experimental data was used to evaluate mass transfer coefficients and effective liquid-phase diffusivities. Diffusivities varied between 1. 3 and 4. 6 sq. cm. /sec., and mass transfer coefficients varied between 0. 07 and 0. 64 cm. /sec. in reasonable agreement with results obtained in studies of liquid-liquid extraction in pulsed columns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{preparation}} of bean rust (Uromyces pha-seoli) germ tube walls, consisting of short, filamentous particles, was labeled with fluorescein iso-thiocyanate. <b>Freeze</b> <b>sections</b> of host and non-host tissue were incubated in the labeled preparation. Maximum stain-ing {{was observed in}} host plant tissue (Phaseolus vul-garis), in which bean rust regularly forms haustoria. In tissue of the non-host plants Vigna sinensis and Phaseolus lunatus, where fewer haustoria were formed, staining was only weak. However, no staining was observed in the non-host issue of Phaseolus aureus, Helianthus annuus, Brassica oleracea and Hordeum vulgare in which the infection hypha did not form haustoria. This would appear to indicate that for-mation of haustoria is induced by a specific attachment of the hyphal wall to the host wall.

40|$|Henwil Chickens is {{a chicken}} {{abattoir}} in Lichtenburg Northwest province. The production line slaughters 60000 chickens {{per day in}} one 10 -hour shift. Henwil wish to implement a second shift, which will run {{through the night and}} will allow them to double daily production. However the current production line at the abattoir is not capable of handling a second shift mainly due to a constraint in the blast <b>freezing</b> <b>section.</b> The current blast freezer configuration used at Henwil needs to run through the night in order to complete the freezing of products from the day’s production. For this reason Henwil have decided to install a carton freezer which is capable of freezing enough products to allow them to implement a second shift which will run through the night and ultimately double production. This study includes three major phases. The first phase was process mapping including all details of the process, data collection and topic research with reference to different simulation software packages. The second phase was composed of data analysis and simulation model construction representing the Henwil abattoir process in order to gain a holistic view of how the process runs and how it is affected by the proposed changes in the system. Finally the simulation model needed to be validated and findings documented including results and conclusions. The project seeks to advise Henwil on the impact that implementing a carton freezer will have on the current process and its resources and once it has been implemented how best to use the resources available to them in order to achieve optimum production from the line.

Quantitative mass measurements showed that the fixed cells are freely permeable to sucrose. The frozen hydrated sections were severely compressed but cell profiles regained their circular appearance upon thawing. The average section thickness of our frozen-hydrated sections was 110 nm: this was reduced to 30 - 50 nm upon thawing, washing, and air-drying. This change was accompanied by severe drying artifacts.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix protein tenascin (TN) is overexpressed {{in a number}} of solid tumours. Thi however, is the first study to examine TN expression in ovarian tumours.

Seven omental metastases were also examined and showed a strikingly similar protein distribution to their primary tumour counterparts. The expression pattern of different RNA isoforms, created by alternative splicing of the primary transcript, was identified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). The smallest TN RNA splice variant (284 bp) was found in all tumours examined, while the appearance of larger molecular weight transcripts (approximately 490 and 556 bp), as major forms, was predominantly limited to malignant tumours, with 9 / 12 malignant tumours showing this pattern compared with 1 / 6 benign tumours. These data suggest that malignant ovarian tumours have increased expression of TN compared with benign tumours and this may be associated with induction of specific isoforms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> of stem <b>sections</b> and entire twigs of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to occur without increasing the resistance to the movement of water through the frozen part after rewarming. This was interpreted to mean that freezing did not produce cavitation in the xylem sap even though A) the sap was unquestionably frozen; B) it contained dissolved gases; and C) it was under tension before freezing and after. <b>Freezing</b> stem <b>sections</b> of some other evergreen gymnosperms during the summer again produced no evidence for cavitation of the xylem sap. On the other hand, <b>freezing</b> stem <b>sections</b> of some angiosperms invariably increased the resistance to sap flow leading to wilting and death {{in a few hours}} when the sap tension was at normal daytime values at the time of freezing. These results were interpreted to mean that the bordered pits on the tracheids of gymnosperms function to isolate the freezing sap in each tracheid so that the expansion of water upon freezing not only eliminates any existing tension but also develops positive pressure in the sap. Dissolved gases frozen out of solution may then be redissolved under this positive pressure as melting occurs. As the bubbles are reduced in size by this ice pressure developed in an isolated tracheid, further pressure is applied by the surface tension of the water against air. If the bubbles are redissolved or are reduced to sufficient small size by the time the tension returns to the sap as the last ice crystals melt, then the internal pressure from surface tension in any existing small bubbles may exceed the hydrostatic tension of the melted sap and the bubbles cannot expand and will continue to dissolve...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{black-and-white}} patterning of tendon fascicles when visualized {{by light}} microscopy, {{also known as}} crimp, is a well-known feature of fiber-forming collagens. However, not much is known about its development, function and response to strain. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the interaction of tenocyte and crimp morphology as well as their changes with increasing age and acute strain. In contrast to previous studies, which used indirect measures, such as polarized light, to investigate the crimp structure, this study visualizes internal crimp structure in three dimensions without <b>freezing,</b> <b>sectioning,</b> staining or fixing the tissue, via two-photon imaging of green fluorescent protein expressing cells within mouse tail tendon fascicles. This technique further allows straining of the live tissue while visualizing changes in crimp morphology and cell shape with increasing specimen length. Combining this novel microscopy technique with computational image and data analysis revealed a complex relationship between tenocytes and the extracellular matrix that evolves with increasing age. While the reduction of crimping with strain was observed as expected, most of the crimps were gone at 0 – 1 % strain already. Even relatively low strains of 3 % led to pronounced changes in the crimp structure after relaxation, particularly in the young animals, which could not be seen with bright-field imaging. Cell length and gap width increased with strain. However, while the cells were able to return to their original length even after high strains of 6 %, the gaps between the cells widened, which may imply modified cell–cell communication after overstretching...|$|R

METHODS: Several pathology laboratories were asked to carry out immunohistochemical oestrogen receptor staining {{on a set of}} <b>freeze</b> dried cryostat <b>sections</b> of breast cancer tissue. The sections and protocols for staining and semi-quantitative scoring were mailed to the participating laboratories in two trials. The oestrogen receptor content of the breast cancer samples was determined by radioligand binding assay on the tumour cytosol. RESULTS: In the first trial 11 laboratories (response rate 60 %) participated. Eight (73 %) of the participants scored within a 95 % confidence interval and all but one correctly classified the tumour as receptor positive. In the second trial all 20 participating laboratories (response rate 55 %) correctly scored one tumour sample as negative and 18 of them (90 % of respondents) correctly classified the two other tumour samples as receptor positive. In a quantitative evaluation a histochemical score within 95 % confidence interval limits was provided by eight (40 %) and 12 (60 %) of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Semiquantitative scoring of immunocytochemical staining is valuable for performing correlative inter-laboratory studies, although this scoring protocol may not be required for diagnosis or prognosis. Significant inter-laboratory variability exists, leading to qualitatively correct receptor classification in 100 % of receptor negative and 80 % of receptor positive cases, and quantitative agreement in only about half of the cases.

Segments of individual nephrons were dissected from <b>freeze</b> dried <b>sections</b> and analyzed for ATP, phosphocreatine, glycogen, glucose, glucose- 6 -phosphate, lactate and creatine kinase. ATP fell most rapidly in proximal convoluted and straight tubules (PCT, PST) and distal convoluted tubules (DCT), and most slowly in glomerulus and papilla. Phosphocreatine levels ranged fivefold and was highest in DCT, where it approached that of brain. Creatine kinase ranged 100 -fold with lowest level in PCT, where the ischemic fall in phosphocreatine was so slow as to suggest a function other than that of an energy reserve. Glycogen varied tenfold from modest levels in distal segments to very low levels in PST, and was not used rapidly in any segment. Glucose consumption and lactate production were most rapid in distal portions. High–energy phosphate consumption for the first 7. 5 seconds of ischemia, calculated from these data, indicates roughly–equal energy metabolism in proximal and distal segments, with lower levels in papilla, and especially in glomerulus. The absolute values suggest that the in vivo metabolic rate of the nephron continued almost unabated for 5 or 10 seconds of ischemia...|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for blasting the tunnel, worth NOK 347 million, {{was awarded to}} Scandinavian Rock Group. Construction commenced on 14 April 1997. In addition to attack from both ends, blasting was also carried out from a 700 m long crosscut on the Hurum side. A major accident took place on 9 October, when a pile of stones fell onto a worker. Most of the tunneling took place through bedrock gneiss. However, in January 1998 the tunnelers met a wall of sediments. Although projected, {{it turned out to}} be more than 10 m thick, instead of the expected 5 m, delaying the project with six weeks. The segment was overcome by injecting concrete to create a shell before removing the masses. Thus a 300 m diverting tunnel was blasted in a curve under the area to allow work to continue while work continued on the weak zone. The issue added NOK 30 million to the construction costs. The zone, created by an ancient river, was overcome by <b>freezing</b> the <b>section</b> and then blasting through it. Then a 1.2 m thick and 40 m long concrete shell was built to give the area structure. The tunneling was completed on 4 February 1999.|$|R
