Parameters, such as mass change, heat release, oxygen consumption, and formation of oxidation products in the gas or solid phase, have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the oxidation process.

40|$|Nickel alloys such as Alloy 600 undergo Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in {{pure water}} at {{temperatures}} between about 260 C {{and the critical}} point. Increasing the level of Cr in Ni-Fe-Cr alloys increases SCC resistance in aerated and deaerated water. The mechanism is not understood. The effect of Cr composition on oxide microstructure and corrosion kinetics of Ni-Fe-Cr alloys was determined experimentally, to evaluate whether the anodic dissolution model for SCC can account for the effect of Cr on SCC. The alloy corrosion rate and corrosion product oxide microstructure is strongly influenced by the Cr composition. Corrosion kinetics are parabolic and influenced by chromium concentration, with the parabolic constant first increasing then decreasing as Cr increases from 5 to 39 %. Surface analyses using Analytical Electron microscopy (AEM) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) show that the corrosion product film that forms initially on all alloys exposed to high purity high temperature water is a nickel rich oxide. With time, the amount of chromium in the oxide film increases and corrosion proceeds toward {{the formation of the}} more thermodynamically stable spinel or hexagonal Cr-rich oxides, similar to high temperature <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxidation.</b> Due to the slower diffusion kinetics at the temperatures of water corrosion compared to those in high temperature <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxidation,</b> however, the films remain as a mixture of NiO, mixed Ni, Fe and Cr spinels, NiCrO{sub 3 } and FeCrO{sub 3 }. As the amount of Cr in the film increases {{and the nature of the}} film changes from NiO to spinel or hexagonal oxides, cation diffusion through the films slows, slowing the corrosion rate. These observations are qualitatively consistent with an anodic dissolution SCC mechanism.

40|$|The main {{target of}} this thesis {{is the study}} of coupled {{transfer}} and reaction phenomena that take place in Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filters. The study is based on measurements and simulation tools of the transient behavior of particulate filters and oxidation catalysts, which have been developed by Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics. The examination of catalyzed filters begins with their filtration efficiency and pressure drop behavior during the loading conditions. The new semi-empirical mathematical model of filtration efficiency simulation is presented for first time, and validated against various operating conditions. The presence of washcoat loading increases the filtration efficiency and the pressure drop, due to the decrease of the filter’s porosity. At high flow rate conditions and large mean pore size substrate the amount of soot collected in the wall is larger, affecting the passive regeneration behavior of the filter. The Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter (CDPF) and the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) were examined on their <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxidation</b> performance of diesel exhaust. At steady - state and high flow rate operating conditions the CDPF is more effective at the HC oxidation performance. At transient conditions the DOC is more effective to the <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxidation</b> performance. The study which follows examines the low-temperature passive regeneration behavior of catalyzed filters. At 330 °C the systems with DOC upstream are more effective during regeneration, due to the increased NO 2 concentration, which acts directly on the soot layer. At 400 °C the regeneration is based on the NO 2 diffusion phenomena. The study of high temperature - active regeneration performance follows. If the filter soot loading is controlled at levels below a carefully selected threshold, e. g. in the range of 8 g/l, via the regeneration control system, then the single CDPF system and the DOC+CDPF one exhibit comparable efficiencies and maximum temperatures, during the active regeneration with post injection. The study is completed with the evaluation of a zoned catalyzed filter, with axial zones of different activity. A catalyzed filter with larger precious metal loading at its front part is examined experimentally and computationally. The CDPF with the larger amount of Pt at its front part can replace the uniform coated one, with a great advantage at the cost. ...|$|E

The behaviour of the SOA/VOC/NO x system simulated using the explicit model agrees with general tendencies observed during laboratory chamber experiments. This explicit modelling of SOA formation appears as a useful exploratory tool to (i) support interpretations of SOA formation observed in laboratory chamber experiments, (ii) give some insights on SOA formation under atmospherically relevant conditions and (iii) investigate implications for the regional/global lifetimes of the SOA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAdvanced Diesel engine {{technologies}} employ Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) {{to offer}} substantial advantages to {{the reduction of}} NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions but will most probably not succeed to make the application of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) dispensable in the future. In this work {{the research and development}} efforts for the realization of a Multi-Functional catalyst Reactor (MFR) for the exhaust of the upcoming diesel engines is presented. This work is based on recent advances in catalytic nano-structured materials synthesis and coating techniques. Different <b>gaseous</b> and soot <b>oxidation</b> catalytic functionalities have been carefully distributed in the filter substrate microstructure and a novel filter design has been applied to enable internal heat recovery capability by the implementation of heat exchange between the outlet and the inlet to the filter flow paths. MFR prototypes, suitable for the abatement of both gaseous and PM emissions of the LTC engine operation, have been realized. The evaluation results of the MFR performance under both conventional and advanced combustion engine operating conditions are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gamma-TiAl {{samples were}} treated by phosphoric acid {{solutions}} at different concentrations. With 15 mol/dm 3, a viscous deposit was {{left on the}} surface leading, after drying and high temperature oxidation, to a very heterogeneous surface aspect. Concentrations below 0. 5 mol/dm 3 were then used and allowed to greatly ameliorate the homogeneity of the superficial layer. After heating from ambient to oxidation temperature, however, cracks were always observed, due to the departure of <b>gaseous</b> molecules. Isothermal <b>oxidation</b> tests come out at 800 °C and 900 °C under reconstituted air showed that weight gains were strongly reduced when TiAl had been treated. A compound containing titanium, oxygen and phosphorus was detected {{at the end of}} the heating period, identified as titanium pyrophosphate, TiP 2 O 7. This compound remained the only one detected for 100 h when oxidation was come out at 800 °C, but evolved towards TiO 2 when oxidation time was increased. In the case of oxidation at 900 °C, the evolution from TiP 2 O 7 to TiO 2 also happened but appeared to go faster...|$|R
40|$|Various photosensitizers were grafted by {{conventional}} peptide coupling methods to functionalized silica with several macroscopic shapes (powders, films) or embedded in highly transparent and microporous silica xerogel monoliths. Owing to the transparency and free-standing {{shape of the}} monoliths, the transient species arising from irradiation of the PSs could be analyzed and were not strikingly different from those observed in solutions. The observed reactivity for either liquid-solid (α-terpinene oxygenation vs dehydrogenation) or gas-solid (dimethylsulfide, DMS, solvent-free oxidation) reactions {{was consistent with the}} properties of the excited states of the PSs under consideration. Immobilized anthraquinone-derived materials preferentially react in both cases by electron transfer from the substrate to the triplet state of the sensitizer, in spite of an efficient singlet oxygen production. The recently developed 9, 14 -dicyanobenzo[b]triphenylene- 3 -carboxylic acid, DBTP-COOH, efficiently reacts via energy transfer to yield singlet oxygen from its triplet state. It was shown to perform better than 9, 10 -dicyanoanthracene and rose bengal for DMS oxidation and α-terpinene photooxygenation to ascaridole, respectively. Thus, by a proper choice of the organic immobilized photocatalyst, it is possible to develop efficient and reusable materials, activated under visible light, for various applications and to tune the reaction pathway, opening the way to green oxidation processes. The properties and applications of several silica materials, containing anthraquinone and cyanoanthracene derivatives as photosensitizers, have been investigated. Besides the photochemistry results, either for liquid α-terpinene or <b>gaseous</b> dimethylsulfide <b>oxidation,</b> the direct detection of the transient species and the determination of singlet oxygen lifetimes and quantum yields in highly transparent and porous silica monoliths were carried out. This overview allows a critical comparison of the properties of the sensitizers, and of various silica macrostructurations. The visible-light activity of these easily prepared materials opens the route to tunable green photochemistry...|$|R
