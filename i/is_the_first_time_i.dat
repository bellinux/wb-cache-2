This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have ever heard music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine'... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is {{not the result of}} innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 , or five and a half octaves... The 'phonograph tone' is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.|$|E
500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, and this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> can really say I'm {{looking forward to}} the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{that the}} Americans would move {{the rest of}} their troops across the river, Brock ordered an {{immediate}} attack on their position. True to his philosophy of never ordering men where he would not lead them, he personally led the charge on foot. Brock's charge was made by Dennis' and Williams' two companies of the 49th and two companies of militia. The assault was halted by heavy fire and as he noticed unwounded men dropping to the rear, Brock shouted angrily that [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen the 49th turn their backs! Surely the heroes of Egmont will not tarnish their record!" [...] At this rebuke, the ranks promptly closed up and were joined by two more companies of militia, those of Cameron and Heward. Brock saw that the militia supports were lagging behind {{at the foot of the}} hill and ordered one of his Provincial aides-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel John Macdonell, to [...] "Push on the York Volunteers," [...] while he led his own party to the right, presumably intending to join his party with that of Williams' detachment, who were beginning to make progress on that flank.|$|E

5000|$|This game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal {{defeated}} the Bruins at the Rose Bowl since 1996.

[...] This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Stanford had achieved a road shutout against an opponent since 1974.

500|$|Another {{instance}} of murder occurred on October 3, 1880, when Thomas Forrest stabbed Michael Carbis. Carbis, the foreman of the California mine, had fired Forrest {{the day before}} {{on account of his}} violent nature. The murder occurred near the Buckeye boarding house. Forrest initially had a pistol, but he put it away and drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of Carbis. Carbis died soon after the stab wound was inflicted. Silver Reef's residents were angered by the murder and soon lynch threats were delivered. Forrest, who had been arrested soon after the murder had been committed, was transferred to the jail in St. George for his own safety. Prior to the moving of Forrest, a lynch mob gathered and followed the sheriff's escort to the St. George jail. Once there, they overpowered the sheriff, took Forrest out of his cell, and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole. When the pole broke, they took him to a cottonwood tree and hung him there. The residents of St. George were shocked at the sight of Forrest's hanging, and one man was reputed to have said, [...] "I have observed that tree growing there for the last 25 years. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen it bearing fruit." ...|$|E

I hope readers find the book is not only a story of injustice, but also one of hope." [...] Early reviews of the book were relatively praising of its literary merit.

2500|$|After the game, many sports writers {{commented on}} Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't {{impressed}} by it. [...] "How {{can you be}} in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?" [...] Warner pointed out. [...] "People think this season <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> touched a football; they don't realize I've {{been doing this for}} years – just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, and when you do achieve something, you know luck {{has nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This is {{the sixth}} one I have seen here at San Quentin, and I {{have to say}} this was very different. The most notable thing was that Williams had {{supporters}} {{at the back of the}} room… Mrs. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an innocent man!' [...] which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there." ...|$|E
2500|$|This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{have felt}} that I could {{take the time to}} write and also that I had {{anything}} to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E

Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B. Zulueta of The Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked [...] "It [...] is absorbing to watch because of its assay at the riddle of sexuality {{as well as the}} performance of Santos". Asked about her significant career milestone, Santos stated [...] " [...] I feel that this is my transition film because this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did a film like this. I'm already 26 years old and I think it is hightime that I do films like this." [...] She won several awards for her performance, including the Gawad Urian Award, the Entertainment Press Society's Golden Screen Award and the Film Academy of the Philippines Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role.|$|E
