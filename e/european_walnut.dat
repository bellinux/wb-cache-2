50|$|Holul de Onoare (The Hall of Honour) was {{finished}} completely only in 1911, {{under the guidance}} of Karel Liman. It spreads over three floors. Walls are dressed in exquisitely carved woodwork, mostly <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> and exotic timbers. Bas-reliefs, alabaster sculptures, and retractable stained glass panels complete the decor.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the study of nuts of <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia) arising as waste from the {{agricultural}} production {{for the removal of}} heavy metals from aqueous solutions. The suitability of the given biosorbent was verified through the determination of its adsorption capacity (equilibrium) and rate (kinetics) of adsorption of the studied metal (lead). The shells of the <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> were first activated by 0. 1 M of HCl and 0. 1 M of NaOH, while the activation by sodium hydroxide was more effective than activation by HCl. In order to identify the most suitable method of activation for the given biosorbent, biosorption of <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> shells activated by NaOH at concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 2 mol/L was further studied, and the time of activation was 5, 15, 30 and 45 min. The output analyses imply that the most effective chemical treatment of the biosorbent is the activation of <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> shells by means of NaOH at concentration of 1 mol/L for 30 min. However, also activation by sodium hydroxide at concentration of 1 mol/L for 15 min is suitable, which is very important with regard to the economy in time...|$|E
50|$|Zvezdara {{forest is}} an example of an urban biotope. There are 136 plant species in the forest. Trees are mostly allochtoonous and typical for the ruderal habitats. Nine of the tree species are rare, relict, endemic or endangered: American {{mountain}} ash, white poplar, cherry tree, birch, Norway maple, <b>European</b> white-elm, <b>walnut</b> tree, field elm and Turkish hazel. The most common tree species in the forest include black locust, black poplar, Canadian poplar, sycamore maple, pedunculate oak, black pine and Scots pine. In 2009 an average tree age was estimated at 50 years.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the impacts of species {{characteristics}} on the surface roughness of five species with different wood density namely white fir, Aleppo pine, <b>European</b> beech, <b>walnut</b> and white oak. The sample specimens tested were 300 x 300 x 30 mm in size and their surface quality was evaluated by the "the direct contact method" based on a mechanical system of measurement, giving the possibility of reproducing the surface measured and analyzing its profile. The surface roughness measurements were performed with a contact stylus profilometer, holding the moisture content of the specimens constant at 10 %. The evaluation of the surface characteristics of the wood samples considered the roughness parameters: arithmetic mean deviation of the profile, maximum two point height of the profile, mean roughness depth and root-mean-square deviation of the profile. From the study result showed different average values of surface roughness parameters for broadleaved and conifers species. The differences can be explain by the influence on the roughness of the wood surface of the wood texture and the texture uniformity...|$|R

Analyses of black walnut tree diameters 13 years after planting showed that inter-planting autumn-olive, black locust, and <b>European</b> alder increased <b>walnut</b> tree growtb, {{but only at}} certain locations. Interplanting autumn-olive resulted in increases of 56 to 351 % at four of five locations and all species resulted in doubled walnut growth on an upland site. The interaction between treatment and location indicates that a fuller under-standing of site and nurse species characteristics is needed to obtain {{the potential benefits of}} mixed plantings...|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> or common <b>walnut</b> {{is a large}} tree prized as a {{multipurpose}} species: {{it provides}} valuable timber and produces a high-quality edible nut. The diffusion of the species in Italy has been largely influenced by the human activity, mainly through germplasm movement, selection of genotypes most suited for wood or fruit production and adaptation induced on fruit crop reproductive materials. As a consequence, genetic variability has been reduced, so that programs aimed at its preservation appear of the utmost importance. 104 walnut plants growing in Piedmont, northwestern Italy, were investigated through genetic variation scored at RAPD loci, yielded by PCR amplification of 10 decamer primers. Among the 101 studied loci, only 53 were polymorphic, showing {{a low level of}} genetic variation within the studied material. Genetic differentiation was estimated both at individual and geographical area level. Only in few cases trees growing in the same area showed to be genetically similar, while the differentiation between areas accounted for about 10 % of the total variation, according to AMOVA. No significant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances. The results of the study showed that also in Piedmont (such as it was already demonstrated in other parts of Italy) the distribution of common walnut is a direct consequence of the human activity. The selection of individual trees, to be used as basic materials for seed supply, should therefore be based mainly on phenotypic traits, rather than ecological features of the location: in species characterized by artificial diffusion, the adoption of Region of Provenance has a scarce significance and prominence should be given to the phenotype selection...|$|R
