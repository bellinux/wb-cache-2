2500|$|Some {{contemporary}} {{speakers and}} writers prefer the name Arpitan because it underscores {{the independence of}} the language and does not imply a union to any other established linguistic group. [...] "Arpitan" [...] is derived from an indigenous word meaning [...] "alpine" [...] ("mountain highlands"). It was popularized in the 1980s by Mouvement Harpitanya, a political organization in the Aosta Valley. In the 1990s, the term lost its particular political context. The Aliance Culturèla Arpitana (Arpitan Cultural Alliance) is currently advancing the cause for the name [...] "Arpitan" [...] through the <b>Internet,</b> <b>publishing</b> efforts and other activities. The organization was founded in 2004 by Stéphanie Lathion and Alban Lavy in Lausanne, Switzerland, and is now based in Fribourg. In 2010 SIL adopted the name [...] "Arpitan" [...] as the primary name of the language in ISO 639-3, with [...] "Francoprovençal" [...] as an additional name form.|$|E
