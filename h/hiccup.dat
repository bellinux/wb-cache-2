40|$|<b>Hiccups</b> are an involuntarily {{powerful}} {{spasm of}} the diaphragm, {{followed by a}} sudden inspiration with a closure of the glottis. <b>Hiccups</b> that are caused by gastric distention, spicy foods and neural dysfunction can resolve themselves without any treatment. Some <b>hiccups</b> are associated with certain diseases or they occur postsurgically, and life-restricting intractable <b>hiccups</b> should be treated. The cause of <b>hiccups</b> should be quickly determined so as to administer the proper treatment. <b>Hiccups</b> often remit spontaneously within {{a short period of}} time, but they may also occur without remission for a prolonged period in some cases. We report here on a 36 -year-old man who suffered with intractable <b>hiccups</b> for 5 years. We administered a single oral dose of baclofen, and then the <b>hiccups</b> disappeared.

30|$|The {{classification}} of <b>hiccups</b> {{is based on}} their duration. An acute attack lasts less than forty-eight hours. Persistent <b>hiccups</b> last more than 2  days. Intractable <b>hiccups</b> are present if the attack lasts more than 1  month. Persistent <b>hiccups</b> {{are most likely to}} be associated with an underlying pathological, anatomic or organic disease process (Cymet 2002). Intractable <b>hiccups</b> that continue for more than 1  month are usually indicative of a serious organic disturbance (Vaidya 2000). If left untreated, intractable <b>hiccups</b> can cause severe discomfort, depression, reduced physical strength, and even death (Consults 2011). According to a report by William H. Dobelle, approximately 4000 hospital admissions due to <b>hiccups</b> are reported each year in the United States (Dobelle 1999). The intractable <b>hiccups</b> are more common in men (82  %) than in women. Most of the men suffering from <b>hiccups</b> are 50  years of age or older (Cymet 2002). Psychogenic <b>hiccups</b> have been reported to occur more commonly in women. The usual rate for <b>hiccups</b> is four to sixty per minute with fairly constant frequency in an individual (Howes 2012). Pathological <b>hiccups</b> can be explained as a form of epilepsy or a failure of supra-spinal inhibition (Launois et al. 1993; Lewis 1985). The incidence and prevalence of persistent and intractable <b>hiccups</b> in the community has not been studied.|$|R

5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would <b>hiccup</b> even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or <b>hiccup.</b> Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E

The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition.

40|$|<b>Hiccups</b> are {{occasionally}} {{experienced by}} most individuals. Although <b>hiccups</b> are not life-threatening, they {{may lead to}} a decline in quality of life. Previous studies showed that <b>hiccups</b> may occur as an adverse effect of certain medicines during chemotherapy. Furthermore, a male dominance in <b>hiccups</b> has been reported. However, due to the limited number of studies conducted on this phenomenon, debate still surrounds the few factors influencing <b>hiccups.</b> The present study aimed to investigate the influence of medicines and patient characteristics on <b>hiccups</b> using a large-sized adverse drug event report database and, specifically, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Cases of adverse effects associated with medications were extracted from JADER, and Fisher's exact test was performed to assess {{the presence or absence of}} <b>hiccups</b> for each medication. In a multivariate analysis, we conducted a multiple logistic regression analysis using medication and patient characteristic variables exhibiting significance. We also examined the role of dexamethasone in inducing <b>hiccups</b> during chemotherapy. Medicines associated with <b>hiccups</b> included dexamethasone, levofolinate, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, and irinotecan. Patient characteristics associated with <b>hiccups</b> included a male gender and greater height. The combination of anti-cancer agent and dexamethasone use was noted in more than 95 % of patients in the dexamethasone-use group. <b>Hiccups</b> also occurred in patients in the anti-cancer agent-use group who did not use dexamethasone. Most of the medications that induce <b>hiccups</b> are used in chemotherapy. The results of the present study suggest that it is possible to predict a high risk of <b>hiccups</b> using patient characteristics. We confirmed that dexamethasone was the drug that has the strongest influence on the induction of <b>hiccups.</b> However, the influence of anti-cancer agents on the induction of <b>hiccups</b> cannot be denied.
