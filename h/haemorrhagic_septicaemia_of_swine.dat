40|$|The {{history of}} Pasteurella multocida (sometimes called Pasteurella septica) as a {{pathogen}} of animals {{dates back to}} the mid-nineteenth century. It has long been held responsible for the disease known as <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> in a large variety of animals, both tame and wild. In the 1850 â€™s, many workers {{in the course of their}} investigations found in varied sick or dead animals, an organism that is now called Pasteurella but was not known by any name at that time. These organisms, apparently pathogenic, were isolated from animals suffering from a disease of a haemorrhagic nature. Hueppe (1886) collected strains of these organisms from various sources. His study included organisms from fowl cholera, rabbit <b>septicaemia,</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> <b>of</b> cattle, including wild deer, wild boar and swine plague. He was endeavouring to show that this organism was a soil bacterium, similar in behaviour in respect to infectivity, to the anthrax bacillus. In this he was not too successful, although there are still some workers in Europe today who hold tentatively to this view. What Hueppe did show was a relationship of the organisms isolated from various sources to one another. [ [...] . ...|$|R

Recombinant protein fragments of gly-coprotein and nucleoprotein from the rhabdovirus causing viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> <b>of</b> trout (VHSV), were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, Yersinia ruckeri (a trout pathogen) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant protein fragments stimulated anam-nestic responses in leukocyte cultures derived from the anterior kidney of survivors of VHSV infection but not from uninfected trout. Two types of stimulatory anam-nestic responses were detected, (i) a stimulation of lymphoproliferation as measured by thymidine incor-poration assays and (ii) an increase in number, spreading and size of cells as determined by fibrin-clot and/or flow cytometry techniques. The evidence pr sented suggests that both adherent and non-adherent rout cell popul-ations are needed for the immunological response to VHSV in this primitive vertebrate.

Acute <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> was confirmed in beef calves on one small farm, and was suspected on two further nearby holdings with concomitant unexplained losses. The source of the infection could not be determined. Apart from a short duration of depression and loss of appetite, the affected calves developed characteristic distal limb oedema. Gross findings in two calves submitted for laboratory examinations included subcutaneous oedema and haemorrhages on serous membranes, and in one case severe pharyngeal lymph node enlargement was observed. Histological examinations revealed lesions characteristic <b>of</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> Moderate to large amounts of Pasteurella antigens were detected in all organs tested by immunohistochemistry. Two isolates of P. multocida (Pm 240, Pm 241) were cultured from these cases and examined in detail. These were identified as P. multocida ssp. multocida biovar 3.

40|$|Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} that {{resides in}} the upper respiratory tract of domesticated animals. It is responsible for pneumonia in cattle, sheep and pigs, atrophic rhinitis in pigs, fowl cholera in poultry and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> <b>of</b> cattle and buffaloes. Different strains of P. multocida are associated with disease in different host species but {{little is known about}} the molecular basis of virulence and host-specificity in this pathogen. The outer membrane of P. multocida is at the interface between pathogen and host and it is highly likely that outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are involved in disease pathogenesis and host-specificity. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are derived from the outer membrane and there is increasing evidence of their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Hence, the present study aimed to compare the composition of OMPs and OMVs derived from different strains of P. multocida using proteomic approaches. Proteomic characterisation was carried out on the outer membranes of eight P. multocida isolates using gel-based and gel-free methods. A combination of gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches identified a total of 67 OMPs associated with outer membrane biogenesis and integrity (11 proteins), transport and receptor activities (19 proteins), adherence (9 proteins), enzymatic activity (6 proteins) and unknown functions (22 proteins). Of these, 44 proteins were identified by both methods, 21 proteins were identified only by the gel-based method and two proteins were identified only by the gel-free approach. The study also characterised OMV production from the same P. multocida isolates and assessed the optimal OMV protein concentrations at different stage of growth. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis indicated that OMVs were enriched with OMPs and LPS. The OmpA protein was used as an outer membrane marker protein and its presence in OMVs was demonstrated by Western-blotting and immunogold-labelling. Proteomic analysis of the OMVs derived from the same eight P. multocida isolates was carried out by the gel-free approach in three biological replicates. A total of 200 proteins were identified and these included 58 OMPs, 43 periplasmic proteins, eight inner membrane proteins, 85 cytoplasmic proteins and six extracellular proteins. Interestingly, the number of proteins identified in the OMVs varied in different P. multocida isolates. Subsequently, OMPs identified in the outer membrane and OMV fractions were compared and the findings showed that OMPs associated with OM biogenesis and integrity were more likely to be present in the outer membrane, whereas OMPs associated with transport and receptor activities were highly enriched in the OMVs. These results highlight the potentially important role that OMVs of P. multocida play in disease pathogenesis and identified proteins for further evaluation as putative virulence factors and candidate vaccine antigens...|$|R

40|$|Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative {{commensal}} bacterium which {{resides in the}} upper respiratory tract of mammals and birds. The organism is responsible {{for a variety of}} economically important diseases {{in a wide range of}} domestic animal species. It causes fowl cholera <b>of</b> poultry, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> <b>of</b> cattle and water buffalo, atrophic rhinitis of pigs, and pneumonia of cattle, sheep and pigs. In the present study, P. multocida isolates were selected based on an established framework of evolutionary relationships among 123 isolates of P. multocida based on the concatenated partial sequences (3990 bp) of seven housekeeping enzyme genes (Davies et al., unpublished; [URL] The isolates were recovered from different host species (cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry) and were associated with different diseases. The isolates represented various capsular serotypes, outer membrane protein (OMP) -types, 16 S rRNA types, and sequence types. Phylogenetic trees based on the concatenated partial sequences (3990 bp) of the seven housekeeping enzyme genes, complete sequences (22, 371 bp) of fifteen housekeeping enzyme genes and the core genome were almost identical in their topographies. The trees represented eight major groups or clusters of isolates and these clusters could also be defined, to varying degrees, by the host species of origin and/or disease syndrome. The pattern of clustering of isolates associated with different host species also demonstrated that transmission of P. multocida has occurred between different host species. Such host-switching could play an important role in generating diversity within P. multocida. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of genes encoding the predicted outer membrane proteins of different functions was carried out in 40 isolates of P. multocida to investigate nucleotide diversity and to assess the roles horizontal DNA transfer and recombination in the evolution and diversification of P. multocida. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis provided clear evidence that horizontal DNA transfer and recombination (both intragenic and assortative) have occurred within the genes encoding P. multocida OMPs. However, it was also demonstrated that this varied from gene-to-gene. Four functional groups of OMPs were predicted based on the prediction analyses and these functions include outer membrane biogenesis and integrity (12 VIII proteins), transport and receptor (25 proteins), adherence (7 proteins) and enzymatic activity (9 proteins). Thirty five OMPs were analysed in this study in detail. The results showed limited levels of nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation was found within the genes encoding selected proteins with the exception of OmpA and OmpH 1. However, there was evidence of gene exchange (assortative recombination) between isolates from different host species and divergent genetic lineages. High levels of nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation was found within two major surface-exposed proteins, OmpA and OmpH 1. The results indicated that the ompA and ompH 1 genes have undergone extensive horizontal DNA transfer, intragenic and assortative recombination. Variation in OmpA and OmpH 1 occurred predominantly in the surface-exposed loop regions. There was strong evidence that natural selection is driving diversification of the hypervariable extracellular loop regions in both proteins. The diversity and molecular evolutionary relationships of ompA were further investigated in a larger selection of 74 P. multocida isolates. Sequence analysis of the 26 different ompA-type alleles revealed that the P. multocida ompA gene has undergone multiple horizontal gene transfer and recombination events because complex mosaic structures were found between ompA alleles. The diversity of temperate bacteriophages was examined in 47 P. multocida isolates. Phage particles were induced with mitomycin C and characterised morphologically by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The phage particles were morphologically diverse and represented both the Siphoviridae and Myoviridae families. Both Siphoviridae and Myoviridae phage types were induced in certain isolates indicating that a single host may harbour multiple prophages. Moreover, phage DNA was successfully isolated from 18 P. multocida isolates. Bacteriophage DNA from isolates PM 86, PM 172, PM 486, PM 934 and PM 954 showed the presence of two bands of different molecular size. Although these phages had a distinct Myoviridae-type morphology, they possessed an unusually small capsid as identified by TEM. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs), in these P. multocida strains. To date, PICIs have not been described in P. multocida. Genetic diversity of temperate bacteriophages was assessed by restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis and 10 different RE types (A to J) were identified.

Prophylaxis {{plays a major role in}} controlling these diseases and many attempts have been made by different workers to develop effective vaccines using various form viz. alum precipitation, formolized and oil adjuvant of whole cell vaccines (Carter, 1967). In the present report attempts were made using capsules, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and outer membrane protein components as vaccine (Confer, 1993). The outer membrane protein (OMP) of Gra...|$|R
40|$|<b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (HS) is an acute, {{infectious}} disease of cattle and buffaloes, {{caused by a}} bacterium Pasteurella multocida. All of the isolates of P. multocida gave consistent results for nitrate reduction test, methyl red test, catalase test, indole production test and gelatin liquifiction test. Variable results were obtained for H 2 S production test. Sugar fermentation tests were uniform for sucrose, glucose, mannose, fructose and salicin but were variable for lactose and maltose. The results of IHA showed {{that all of the}} thirteen isolates agglutinated with the anti-serum raised against Roberts Type I in rabbits. It has been concluded that prevalent serotype of P. multocida causing heamorrhagic septicemia in cattle and buffalo in Faisalabad, Pakistan is Roberts type I, which is equivalent to Carter`s type B...|$|R
40|$|Eight <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia</b> (HS) related Pasteurella multocida isolates, {{collected}} from different localities of Pakistan, {{were characterized by}} sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) technique. After sonification, the bacterial proteins were separated by centrifugation. Proteins from sonicated supernatant were salted out by ammonium sulfate. Sonicated supernatant, as well as ammonium sulfate precipitated proteins, were analyzed. Molecular weights of proteins were determined from graph between Rf value and log of molecular weight. The ammonium sulfate treated samples showed fewer bands with low molecular weights of 54, 45, 42, 40 and 20. 5 kDa, while total 31 visible bands were observed in sonicated supernatants ranging from 126 to 11 kDa. The common protein bands in both preparations were of 54 and 23 kDa molecular weight...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) virus is endemic in Lao PDR, with major {{outbreaks}} each year resulting in significant production losses in all farming systems, including smallholder, semi-intensive and intensive farms. CSF is a vaccine-preventable disease {{and there are}} many vaccines, both live attenuated and subunit, commercially available. In Lao PDR a variety of livestock vaccines are produced at the National Vaccine Production Centre (NVPC), which is located at Nongteng village 15 km from Vientiane. The NVPC was established in 1980 and produces vaccines for CSF, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia,</b> Newcastle disease, fowl cholera, infectious bronchitis, fowl pox and duck plague. CSF vaccine is produced from the live attenuated C-strain virus from homogenised rabbit spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes freeze dried in the presence of stabilisers in a rubber stoppered vial and stored at â€“ 20 Â°C...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} {{have been carried out}} to {{evaluate}} and investigate the important diseases of swamp buffaloes (Bubalus carabanensis) in Kalimantan. More attention has been focused on the case of acute infectious diseases and sudden death in the buffaloes. Fasciolosis black disease, acute enteritis, especially fatal enterotoxaemia <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>septicaemia.</b> and trypanosomiasis (Surra), are some of the important diseases found in these animals. Black disease caused by toxigenic Clostridium novyi occurs {{in the presence of the}} organism in the liver and the degree of liver fluke Fasciola gigantica infestation. In regions where black disease is enzootic, Cl. novvi can be isolated from livers of normal healthy animals. In Hulu Sungai Utara district, South Kalimantan, the prevalence of fasciolosis caused by Fasciola gigantica in swamp buffalo was 77...|$|R
40|$|<b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>Septicaemia</b> (HS), an endemic {{bacterial}} disease, {{is caused}} by specific serotypes of Pasteurella multocida {{and is one of}} the major economic diseases of bovines in south-east Asia including India. Sero-monitoring of vaccinal antibodies and definitive diagnosis of the disease is of utmost importance to combat the economic losses and ELISA system has remained the test of preference due to its versatility. Skimmed milk powder (SMP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) respectively in concentration of 2, 3, 4 % and 0. 5, 1. 0 % have been compared as blocking reagents in ELISA for detection of antibodies against P. multocida. SMP and BSA blocking produced almost equal sensitivity. Results of the ELISA indicate that being inexpensive and easily available, SMP is a suitable blocking reagent for detection of antibodies against P. multocida B: 2 for herd screening as well as in laboratories. </span...|$|R
