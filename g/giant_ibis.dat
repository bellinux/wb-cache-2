5|$|Ratanakiri {{has some}} of the most biologically diverse lowland {{tropical}} rainforest and montane forest ecosystems in mainland Southeast Asia. One 1996 survey of two sites in Ratanakiri and one site in neighboring Mondulkiri recorded 44mammal species, 76bird species, and 9reptile species. A 2007 survey of Ratanakiri's Virachey National Park recorded 30 ant species, 19 katydid species, 37 fish species, 35 reptile species, 26 amphibian species, and 15 mammal species, including several species never before observed. Wildlife in Ratanakiri includes Asian elephants, gaur, and monkeys. Ratanakiri is an important site for the conservation of endangered birds, including the <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> and the greater adjutant. The province's forests contain a wide variety of flora; one half-hectare forest inventory identified 189 species of trees and 320 species of ground flora and saplings.|$|E

50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> is a lowland {{bird that}} occurs in marshes, swamps, lakes, wide rivers, flooded plains and semi-open forests as well as pools, ponds and {{seasonal}} water-meadows in denser deciduous forest. It generally is found in lowlands. One bird was collected in a Malay paddyfield. Formerly the <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> was believed to breed in southeastern Thailand, central and northern Cambodia, southern Laos and southern Vietnam. It was still fairly common in the Mekong Delta until the 1920s but is now almost depleted, with a small remnant population breeding in Cambodia, southern Laos and possibly in Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> (Thaumatibis gigantea), {{the only}} {{species in the}} {{monotypic}} genus Thaumatibis, is a wading bird of the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is confined to northern Cambodia, with a few birds surviving in extreme southern Laos and a recent sighting in Yok Đôn National Park, Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The current Aquatic Bird House {{opened on}} September 24, 1964, on the {{foundation}} of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, {{with the rest of the}} zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them. Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested <b>ibis,</b> <b>giant</b> wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, common terns, African spoonbills, silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and Orinoco geese, and a large aviary home to lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015. The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building, and in May 2015, a colony of little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.|$|R

50|$|Members of {{the family}} have long, broad wings with 11 primary {{feathers}} and about 20 secondaries. They are strong fliers and, rather surprisingly, given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. They are large birds, but mid-sized by the standards of their order, ranging from the dwarf olive ibis (Bostrychia bocagei), at 45 cm and 450 g, to the <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> (Thaumatibis gigantea), at 100 cm and 4.2 kg.|$|E

50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> is {{considered}} to be Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The primary causes seem to be drainage of wetlands for cultivation and the epidemic clear-cutting of forest for rubber, cassava, wood pulp and teak plantations in south-east Asia. Habitats may also face ravaging due to local human warfare. Increasing human populations in Cambodia have in turn lead to disturbance and further lowland deforestation. The ibis may be hunted for meat by people and eggs may be predated by the Asian palm civet and the yellow-throated marten, with the species certainly unable to withstand sustained predation. A reduction in seasonal pools in forest, previously made by now depleted populations of megafauna (especially wild Asian water buffalo), may also negatively effect them. Local droughts, possibly related to global climate change, have appeared to have further compromised the breeding habitat and behaviour of the species. Some conservation efforts have been undertaken, including protecting nests by the installation of metal belts that prevent predators from accessing them, but the protection of ideal habitat and the increasing human populations in Cambodia continues to be a vexing challenge. Increasing ecotourism in the region and education to local people is clearly required for the species to successfully recover from the brink of extinction. The current population is estimated at 100 pairs, with a total population (including young and juveniles) of fewer than 500 individuals. However, even these figures may be optimistic.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little is}} known of the giant ibis's life history. It eats aquatic invertebrates, eels, {{crustaceans}} and small amphibians and reptiles. Insects such as locusts and cicadas are eaten regularly when abundant and seeds occasionally supplement the diet. Outside of the breeding season, frogs and mole-crickets appear to be {{perhaps the most significant}} prey types for giant ibises. They mainly forage in muddy substrate in shallow waters, though can feed at all depths in seasonal forest pools. Feeding flocks may consist of a breeding pair or small family group and have been observed mixing with black ibises. Next to nothing is known of its breeding behaviour, but it nests in trees, with a possible preference for Dipterocarpus trees. Usually, nests are located at least 4 km from human habitations, although the species is not especially shy around or fearful of humans unless persistently harassed or hunted. Females lay two eggs {{at the start of the}} rainy season, around June to September. Earthworms taken from their mounds in wet grasslands appears to be an important food source for nesting ibises of this species. In general, the species is residential but can wander widely for food or in response to disturbances. The <b>giant</b> <b>ibis</b> is generally territorial and may remain with a family group throughout the year. However, in the dry season, when they are not nesting, groups of up to seven individuals, sometimes likely unrelated, have been observed feeding together.|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} {{value of}} traditional agriculture is well recognised in Europe, where retention and restoration of farming practices that support open-habitat species {{is a standard}} management technique. Elsewhere, however, this value is often overlooked while conservation attention is directed at natural habitats and forest biota. This thesis assesses the importance of traditional farming for developing-world biodiversity, using the White-shouldered Ibis Pseudibis davisoni in Cambodia to investigate practices underpinning synanthropic relationships, links between farming-dependent species and local livelihoods, and potential conservation strategies. Ibis status and ecology was investigated by censuses, foraging observations, prey sampling, experimental exclusion of grazing and burning at foraging habitats, and experimental protection of nests. Livelihoods were assessed by social research methods including household income surveys. A literature review found a subset of threatened bird taxa now dependent on traditional farming following the loss of natural processes. Agricultural change, driven by external agribusiness and intrinsic livelihood modernisation, endangers these species, including the ibis. Ibis foraging ecology is closely associated with local livelihood practices, with favoured dry forest habitats created or maintained by domestic livestock grazing, anthropogenic fire and rice cultivation. Not all local practices are beneficial, however: ibis nests are exploited for food by local people, and nest guardians do not improve nest success (although this requires further testing). White-shouldered Ibis’s breeding season contrasts {{with that of the}} sympatric <b>Giant</b> <b>Ibis</b> Thaumatibis gigantea, most likely explained by the former’s dry-season-adapted foraging strategy. Household incomes and livestock capital assets demonstrated that local people share a dependence on the livelihood practices and dry forest landscape supporting the ibis. Nevertheless, local livelihood change (such as mechanisation) may uncouple this linkage, making a potential win-win conservation strategy unviable. Conservation must develop measures to maintain valuable farming practices before they, and the species dependent on them, are lost through agricultural transition...|$|E
