25|$|The Judicial Council is {{the highest}} court in the United Methodist Church. It {{consists}} of nine members, both laity and clergy, elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term. The ratio of laity to clergy alternates every four years. The Judicial Council interprets the Book of Discipline between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference, the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference. The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law. The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation. The Council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world. The Judicial Council also hears appeals <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

From Valhalla, every day Odin chooses <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died in combat.

500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless {{of the events that}} caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E

Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him." [...] The review observed, [...] "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last breath out of his opponents' arguments." [...] Salon characterized the book as, [...] "an instructional book with an argument to convey – a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The law {{has been}} popular among the Republican Party base electorate; however, several Republicans have opposed aspects of the measure, mostly <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{represented}} heavily Hispanic states. [...] These include former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and campaigning U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio, and former George W. Bush chief political strategist Karl Rove. [...] Some analysts have stated that Republican support for the law gives short-term political benefits by energizing their base and independents, but longer term carries the potential of alienating the growing Hispanic population from the party. [...] The issue {{played a role in}} several Republican primary contests during the 2010 congressional election season.|$|E

2500|$|Innokenty Annensky saw Tolstoy's poetry {{as being}} the perfect {{expression}} of [...] "pure love", the [...] "human soul's inner beauty" [...] being the poet's ideal. [...] "Tolstoy never wrote for children but his crystal clear idealism, tinged with mysticism, made his poetry resonate well with the period in adolescence when the human soul reaches out to something high and indescribable," [...] Annensky wrote. Mentioning Nekrasov, who in his latter works created a strong image of the Russian mother, Annensky argued that what Tolstoy managed to create was an equally sublime portrait of the noble woman whose [...] "serene placidity belies unspeakable sadness… of the one who's ashamed of her own happiness fearing that she, {{making the most of}} this world's beauty, somehow takes it away <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> no opportunity to enjoy such riches in abundance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} of the conference was accepted by many congregations of western Europe and in all the American Reform Judaism congregations, which while retaining the melody substituted for the formula a German hymn or a Hebrew psalm (particularly Psalm 130), or changed the old text to the words, [...] "May all the vows arise to thee which the sons of Israel vow unto thee, O Lord, ... that they will return to thee with all their heart, and from this Day of Atonement until the next," [...] etc. Naturally there were many Orthodox opponents of this innovation, among whom M. Lehmann, editor of the Israelit, was especially prominent. In 1961, Kol Nidrei, in its full Aramaic text, was restored to the Reform liturgy, so strong was its sentimental appeal. Among Reconstructionist Jews, it was briefly omitted from the liturgy and then restored but with a slightly revised text that limited its application only to those vows that operated [...] "to estrange ourselves <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> offended us or to give pain {{to those who have}} angered us".|$|E
2500|$|Clement Attlee, Leader of the (Labour) Opposition, responded. He quoted some of Chamberlain's (and Churchill's) {{previous}} confident assertions {{about the}} likely {{victory of the}} British. Ministers' statements and, even more so, the press, guided (or deliberately left uncorrected) by the government, had painted far too optimistic {{a picture of the}} Norwegian campaign; [...] "at last, when the enemy had been locked behind his walls, he had now put out his head to be hit", which prompted Conservative MP and Chamberlain supporter William Davison to shout, [...] "It was very badly hit." [...] Attlee then turned to the conduct of the campaign itself, concluding that [...] "the gravamen of my attack on the Government {{is that it does not}} seem that there was a thinking-out of our plans beforehand, that there was not adequate intelligence, that there was not the necessary concentration on the essential objective and I ask whether, at any time, there was not delay and discussion where action was necessary?" [...] He then attacked the organisation of the Government, talking of [...] "a failure of grip, a failure of drive" [...] in pursuit of the war, concluding, [...] "I say that there is a widespread feeling in this country, not that we shall lose the war, that we will win the war, but that to win the war, we want different people at the helm <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> led us into it." ...|$|E
