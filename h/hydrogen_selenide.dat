Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas.

In solution it ionizes to HSe−. The selenide dianion Se2− forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include mercury selenide (HgSe), lead selenide (PbSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(Ga,In)Se2). These materials are semiconductors.

40|$|Ph. D. The {{reaction}} of direct current (DC) magnetron sputtered metallic CuIn and CuInGa alloys to a reactive H 2 Se/Ar/H 2 S gaseous atmosphere {{is an attractive}} industrial production process to produce Cu-based chalcopyrite absorber films for applications in high efficiency photovoltaic modules. This deposition process is generally {{referred to as a}} two-step deposition technology. However, the obvious technological advantages of this deposition technology are overshadowed by growth-related anomalies, such as the separation or at least partial separation of the ternary phases (i. e. CuInSe 2, CuGaSe 2 and CuInS 2) during the high temperature chalcogenization. This in turn prevents the effective band-gap widening of the semiconductor alloys in order to achieve open-circuit voltages in excess of 600 mV, which is a critical prerequisite for the optimal performance of thin film solar modules. Against this background, a detailed study was undertaken {{in order to understand the}} formation kinetics of quaternary CuIn(Se,S) 2 and pentenary Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 alloys deposited with a reproducible two-step growth technology. The main objective of this study was to optimize a complex set of experimental parameters in order to deposit homogenous alloys in which the band-gap value of the resulting semiconductor film could be modified in order to maximize the operating parameters of photovoltaic devices. This was achieved by the homogenous incorporation of S and/or Ga into the chalcopyrite lattice, resulting in shrinkage of the lattice parameters and hence increase in band-gap value Eg. However, the substitution of In with Ga and Se with S proved to be a complex process. It was, for example, observed that separation or at least partial separation of the ternary phases already occurs during the chemical reaction between the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenides</b> (H 2 Se) gas and the metallic precursors. Detailed studies indicated that this phenomenon was strongly related to the selenization parameters (e. g. reactive gas concentration, and reaction temperature and time) as well as the Cu/(In + Ga) atomic ratio. In optimized processes, the metallic precursor films were partially selenized in order to produce at least one partially reacted Cu-III-VI 2 ternary alloy and group Cu-VI and III-VI binary phases. The partially selenized alloys were subsequently sulphurized under optimal thermal conditions in a H 2 S:Ar gas mixture to produce homogeneous single-phase quaternary and pentenary chalcopyrite alloys. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed that the lattice parameters of the chalcopyrite lattice decreased linearly with the incorporation of S and/or Ga, according to the predictions of Vegard’s law. Gracing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies on the compound semiconductors revealed that the lattice parameters remained virtually constant through the entire depth of the layer. Optical studies revealed a shift in the band-gap value of the absorber films as function of the S concentration. The band-gap of the absorber films could be varied between 0. 99 and 1. 35 eV by controlling the S/Se anion ratio during the diffusion process, while maintaining the Ga/III atomic ratio constant at 0. 25. Solar cells were completed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS and radio frequency (RF) sputtered intrinsic and highly conductive ZnO films onto the absorber films. The cells were evaluated under standard A. M. 1. 5 conditions. Devices manufactured from CuIn(Se,S) 2 and Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 based alloys demonstrated average open-circuit voltages (Voc) and short-circuit current densities (Jsc) values of 470 and 650 mV and 20 and 33 mA. cm- 2, respectively. A plot of the open-circuit voltage as function of the band-gap revealed an experimental relationship of: Voc = (Eg/q – 0. 6) mV for Eg < 1. 3 eV. The fill factor (FF) values varied between 35 and 56 % and device efficiencies () between 4 and 13 %, depending on the S/Se anion ratio and Ga incorporation. The findings from the studies clearly indicated that a better understanding of the CuIn(Se,S) 2 and Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 formation process led to absorber material with improved material properties. It was also demonstrated that it is possible to produce a homogenous CuIn(Se,S) 2 and Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 absorber films with the scalable two-step deposition process...|$|R

2500|$|It {{is used as}} an {{infrared}} optical material with a remarkably wide transmission wavelength range (0.45µm to 21.5µm). The refractive index is about 2.67 at 550nm (green), and about 2.40 at 10.6µm (LWIR). Similar to zinc sulfide, ZnSe is produced as microcrystalline sheets by synthesis from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> gas and zinc vapour.

When free of absorption and inclusions it is ideally suited for CO2 laser optics at 10.6µm wavelength. It is thus a very important IR material. In daily life, {{it can be found}} as the entrance optic in the new range of [...] "in-ear" [...] clinical thermometers, seen as a small yellow window. Zinc selenide can slowly react with atmospheric moisture if poorly polished, but this is not generally a serious problem.

50|$|Selenium is a trace {{nutrient}} required by humans {{on the order}} of tens or hundreds of micrograms per day. A dose of over 450 micrograms can be toxic, resulting in bad breath and body odor.

50|$|HgSe is {{non-toxic}} {{as long as}} it is not ingested due to its insolubility. Toxic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> fumes can be evolved on {{exposure to}} acids. HgSe is a relatively stable compound which might mean that it is less toxic than elemental mercury or many organometallic mercury compounds. Selenium's ability to complex with mercury has been proposed as a reason for the lack of mercury toxicity in deep sea fish despite high mercury levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula H2Se. This hydrogen chalcogenide is {{the simplest and}} most commonly encountered hydride of selenium. H2Se is a colorless, flammable gas under standard conditions. It is the most toxic selenium compound with an exposure limit of 0.05 ppm over an 8-hour period. Even at extremely low concentrations, this compound has a very irritating smell resembling that of decayed horseradish or 'leaking gas', but smells of rotten eggs at higher concentrations.|$|E
50|$|However, {{because they}} formed {{volatile}} hydrides on the primitive Earth when the controlling redox reaction was the oxidation or reduction of hydrogen, the less metallic chalcophile elements are strongly depleted on Earth {{as a whole}} relative to cosmic abundances. This is most especially true of the chalcogens selenium and tellurium (which formed volatile <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> and hydrogen telluride, respectively), which for this reason are among the rarest elements found in the Earth's crust (to illustrate, tellurium is only about as abundant as platinum).|$|E

50|$|Borderline {{hydrides}} exhibit bonding characteristics between ionic and {{covalent bond}} types. A specific {{examples of a}} borderline hydride CuH, copper hydride, that appears as a spongy reddish-brown substance is a moderate reducing agent. It will catalytically oxidize hypophosphorous acid to phosphorous acid at room temperature, and it gives off hydrogen gas when subjected to heat.ZnH2 is also a solid at room temperature that breaks down at 90 °C, but even left alone decomposes over several days to zinc metal and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen telluride (H2Te) and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> (H2Se) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen {{telluride}} (tellane) is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula H2Te. A hydrogen chalcogenide and the simplest hydride of tellurium, it is a colorless gas. Although unstable in ambient air, the gas can exist {{at very low}} concentrations {{long enough to be}} readily detected by the odour of rotting garlic at extremely low concentrations; or by the revolting odour of rotting leeks at somewhat higher concentrations. Most compounds with Te-H bonds (tellurols) are unstable with respect to loss of H2. H2Te is chemically and structurally similar to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide,</b> both are acidic. The H-Te-H angle is about 90°. Volatile tellurium compounds often have unpleasant odours, reminiscent of decayed leeks or garlic.|$|E
50|$|Selenols are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} thiols, but the C-Se bond is about 8% longer at 196 pm. The C-Se-H angle approaches 90° {{as it does}} in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> (H2Se). The bonding involves almost pure p-orbitals on Se, hence the near 90 angles. The Se-H bond energy is weaker than the S-H bond, consequently selenols are easily oxidized and serve as H-atom donors. Also reflecting the relative weakness of bonds to Se, selenols are about 1000 times stronger acids than are thiols: the pKa of CH3SeH is 5.2 vs 8.3 for CH3SH. Deprotonation affords the selenolate anion, RSe−, most examples of which are highly nucleophilic and rapidly oxidized by air.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>selenide</b> is hazardous, {{being the}} most toxic {{selenium}} compound and far more toxic than its congener hydrogen sulfide. The threshold limit value is 0.05 ppm. The gas acts as an irritant at concentrations higher than 0.3 ppm, which is the main warning sign of exposure; below 1 ppm, this is [...] "insufficient to prevent exposure", while at 1.5 ppm the irritation is [...] "intolerable". Exposure at high concentrations, even {{for less than a}} minute, causes the gas to attack the eyes and mucous membranes; this causes cold-like symptoms for at least a few days afterwards. In Germany, the limit in drinking water is 0.008 mg/L, and the US EPA recommends a maximum contamination of 0.01 mg/L.|$|E
