50|$|Incentive-centered design (ICD) is {{the science}} <b>of</b> {{designing}} a <b>system</b> or institution {{according to the}} alignment of individual and user incentives with the <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>system.</b> <b>Using</b> incentive-centered design, <b>system</b> designers can observe systematic and predictable tendencies in users in response to motivators to provide or manage incentives to induce a greater amount and more valuable participation. ICD is often considered when designing a system to induce desirable behaviors from users, such as participation and cooperation. It draws from principles in various areas such as economics, psychology, sociology, design, and engineering. ICD has been gaining attention in research communities due to the role it can play in helping systems benefit their users and ultimately achieve better results.|$|R
40|$|Loose {{coupling}} {{is often}} quoted as a desirable property <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> architectures. One <b>of</b> the main <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> building <b>systems</b> <b>using</b> Web technologies {{is to achieve}} loose coupling. However, {{given the lack of}} a widely accepted definition of this term, it becomes hard to use coupling as a criterion to evaluate alternative Web technology choices, as all options may exhibit, and claim to provide, some kind of “loose ” coupling effects. This paper presents a systematic study of the degree of coupling found in service-oriented systems based on a multi-faceted approach. Thanks to the metric introduced in this paper, coupling is no longer a one-dimensional concept with loose coupling found somewhere in between tight coupling and no coupling. The paper shows how the metric can be applied to real-world examples in order to support and improve the design process <b>of</b> service-oriented <b>systems...</b>|$|R

To best model the DSM-III-R system, a decision tree design has been employed in which questions are sequentially asked about a case, with the answer determining which question is asked next. Since the primary <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> an expert <b>system</b> <b>used</b> for teaching {{is to be able to}} provide explanations of what it is doing, annotated comments and additional explanatory text are available for each question that is asked.

40|$|Introduction Despite its {{relative}} importance {{within the field}} of Human-Computer Interaction, there seems to be growing skepticism of the ability of cognitive science to enrich our understanding of the use of complex technologies. At the practical level, for example, {{it has been suggested that}} the designs and evaluation techniques used by actual designers <b>of</b> computer <b>systems</b> owe little to the models developed within cognitive science (Carroll 1990, Barnard 1991). Moreover, theoretically, cognitive science has been subject to wide ranging criticism concerning for example, its conceptualisation of social action (Winograd and Flores 1986, Lave 1988, Coulter 1989), its approach to user modelling (Suchman 1987, Gilbert 1987) and its intentional models of language and discourse (MciIlvenny 1990, Frohlich and Luff 1990). In line with these criticisms, several researchers have argued that studies of should move away from plan based, <b>goal</b> orientated models <b>of</b> <b>system</b> <b>use</b> and begin to consider t...|$|R

40|$|Steve G. Oliver, Director, Cambridge Systems Biology Centre (CSBC), {{presented}} {{a lecture on}} February 23, 2010 at 11 AM in Room 1103 of the UA Whitaker Building on the Georgia Tech Campus. Runtime: 59 : 13 minutesConstruction of {{a model of the}} eukaryotic cell with both predictive and explanatory power is a key <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> biology. <b>Using</b> a top-down approach, we have identified the cellular components that control growth rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under a range of different nutrient conditions and growth rates. We find that, for some controllers of growth rate (most notably the proteasome), the nature of the control they exert changes according to conditions. At fast growth rates the concentrations of the most abundant growthrate- regulated protein complexes (such as the ribosome, proteasome, and COPI vesicle) become the limiting factors to further growth. We also find that at the very fastest growth rates, some of the key regulators of the cell cycle impose a barrier that prevents growth exceeding a maximum rate (Î¼max). A reduction in the copy number of these genes lowers this barrier and allows faster growth rates to be achieved. While this suggests sub-optimal design, the identity of the haploproficient genes indicates that the imperative of conserving genome integrity results in yeast growing at slower than optimal rates. We find that both haploinsufficient and haploproficient genes are highly conserved in yeast evolution. Moreover, the genomic location of some haploinsufficient genes is also highly conserved and has not been disturbed by major evolutionary upheavals such as whole-genome duplication (WGD). The impact of many of the significant controllers of growth rate is, itself, a function of growth rate, even {{to the extent that the}} sign of the control they exert changes at the fastest growth rates. In other cases, control changes according to the environemtal context. This context dependency makes it difficult to define ”design rules” for biological systems and the prospects for using Robot Scientists to assist in the elucidation of such rules will be discussed...|$|R
