5|$|On March 21, 2017, a new iPad was announced. The {{hardware}} {{includes an}} A9 processor and <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a budget {{version of the}} iPad.|$|E
5|$|Although the A303 {{as a whole}} <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a {{route from}} London to Exeter, a popular {{alternative}} {{is to take the}} M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. Although this is a high-quality motorway route throughout, it is a considerably further distance.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E

50|$|Some DJ {{controllers}} {{break from}} the conventional two jog wheels and a mixer layout and <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily mapped however the user wants. Some controllers <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used either for live PA performances with software such as Ableton Live or with DJ software. A few DJ controllers, most notably the Novation Dicers, <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used with timecode vinyl.|$|R
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{used with}} the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power {{amplifiers}} with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices â€“ excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|Rodmarton Manor is {{a country}} house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, around a large {{circular}} courtyard, covered in grass which <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reminiscent of a village green. The majority of the building is two storeys high and made of coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is made of stone slate, with grouped chimneystacks.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of 71 items and takes 20 minutes <b>to</b> complete.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{constructed from}} plans and emphasized economy. The designer claimed {{it could be}} constructed for US$5000 in 1996, including a second hand Subaru engine. It <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy <b>to</b> convert between tricycle and conventional landing gear.|$|R

5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> charged with a high current of 2amps using the included 10W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector {{at one end and}} a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

5|$|To {{give each}} world a theme, they were each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E
5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
