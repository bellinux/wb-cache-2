In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called somatic <b>hypermutation</b> (SHM).

His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic <b>hypermutation</b> as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work.

IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 18 (5), 674 - 688 Different {{studies have}} {{theoretically}} analyzed {{the performance of}} artificial immune systems {{in the context of}} optimization. It has been noted that, in comparison with evolutionary algorithms and local search, <b>hypermutations</b> tend to be inferior on typical example functions. These studies have used the expected optimization time as performance criterion and cannot explain why artificial immune systems are popular in spite of these proven drawbacks. Recently, a different perspective for theoretical analysis has been introduced, concentrating on the expected performance within a fixed time frame instead of the expected time needed for optimization. Using this perspective we reevaluate the performance of somatic contiguous <b>hypermutations</b> and inverse fitness-proportional <b>hypermutations</b> in comparison with random local search on one well-known example function in which a random local search is known to be efficient and much more efficient than these <b>hypermutations</b> with respect to the expected optimization time. We prove that, depending on the choice of the initial search point, <b>hypermutations</b> can by far outperform random local search in a given time frame. This insight helps to explain the success of seemingly inef- ficient mutation operators in practice. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can benefit from these theoretically obtained insights by designing more efficient hybrid search heuristics. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Whether this inhibition {{is due to}} {{the generation}} of <b>hypermutations</b> or to an alternative mechanism is controversial. A series of APOBEC 3 B (A 3 B) point mutants was analysed in vitro for hypermutational activity on HBV DNA and for inhibitory effects on HBV replication. Point mutations inactivating the carboxy-terminal deaminase domain abolished the hypermutational activity and reduced the inhibitory activity on HBV replication to approximately 40 %. In contrast, the point mutation H 66 R, inactivating the amino-terminal deaminase domain, did not affect <b>hypermutations,</b> but reduced the inhibition activity to 63 %, whilst the mutant C 97 S had no effect in either assay.

25|$|The {{generation}} of TCR diversity {{is similar to}} that for antibodies and B cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo somatic <b>hypermutation,</b> and T cells do not express Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).|$|E

Biology/GeneticsINTRODUCTION: Rearrangement and <b>hypermutations</b> of the bcl- 6 {{oncogene}} {{are found}} commonly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), suggesting a pathogenetic role. METHODS: The pattern of bcl- 6 gene <b>hypermutations</b> was studied in 101 Hong Kong Chinese patients with nodal or extranodal DLBCL. The technique used was polymerase chain reaction, {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The primary {{sites of the}} tumors involved lymph nodes in 52 cases, stomach in 32 and other extranodal sites in 17. <b>Hypermutations</b> at the E 1. 11 and/or El. 12 sites of bcl- 6 gene were detectable in 54 % of the primary nodal and 84 % of extranodal DLBCL (p < 0. 001). DNA sequencing of the PCR fragments revealed that the G 2096 C of the E 1. 11 segment of the bcl- 6 gene was the most commonly mutation observed in DLBCL of either nodal (18 %) or extranodal (38 %) origin. Other random mutations found included G 2097 A, T 2123 A and C 2145 T. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that a significantly higher frequency of bcl- 6 gene <b>hypermutations</b> was found in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of primary extranodal origin, including those arising from the stomach, than that of the nodal counterparts. However, the pattern of mutations was similar for the two groups.

25|$|Autoreactive B {{cells can}} accidentally emerge during somatic <b>hypermutation</b> and migrate into the {{germinal}} center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally {{do not receive}} survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis.

After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence.|$|E

Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic <b>hypermutation</b> of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E
500|$|Many viruses undergo {{frequent}} mutations {{that result}} in changes in amino acid composition of their important proteins. Epitopes located on the protein may also undergo alterations in the process. Such an altered epitope binds less strongly with the antibodies specific to the [...] unaltered epitope that would have stimulated the immune system. This is unfortunate because somatic <b>hypermutation</b> does give rise to clones capable of producing soluble antibodies that would have bound the altered epitope avidly enough to neutralize it. But these clones would consist of naive cells which {{are not allowed to}} proliferate by the weakly binding antibodies produced by the priorly stimulated clone. This doctrine is known as the original antigenic sin. This phenomenon comes into play particularly in immune responses against influenza, dengue and HIV viruses. This limitation, however, is not imposed by the phenomenon of polyclonal response, but rather, against it by an immune response that is biased in favor of experienced memory cells against the [...] "novice" [...] naive cells.|$|E

Using differen-tial display to compare gene expression in CLL cells with and without IgVH hyper-mutations, we identified a novel gene, CLL up-regulated gene 1 (CLLU 1), that was highly up-regulated in CLL cells with-out IgVH <b>hypermutations.</b> CLLU 1 mapped to chromosome 12 q 22, within a cluster of genes that are active in germinal center B cells.

500|$|A naive (or inexperienced) B cell is {{one which}} {{belongs to a}} clone which has never {{encountered}} the epitope {{to which it is}} specific. In contrast, a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory [...] B cell. The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell, most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells; the rest survive as memory B cells. So, when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells, and also leave a few memory cells, this is known as the primary immune response. In the course of proliferation of this clone, the B cell receptor genes can undergo [...] frequent (one in every two cell divisions) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies. These frequent mutations are termed somatic <b>hypermutation.</b> Each such mutation alters the epitope-binding ability of the paratope slightly, creating new clones of B cells in the process. Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope (leading to the selection of the clones possessing them), which is known as affinity maturation. Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation. Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen. Somatic <b>hypermutation,</b> thus, makes the B cell receptors and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens, more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes, apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place. When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells (just like in the clone's primary response), and leave even more memory cells in the process, this is known as a secondary immune response, which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods. The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it (i.e., greater affinity of binding) owing to affinity maturation. The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding.|$|E

In addition to this intrinsic resistance, P. aeruginosa easily develops acquired resistance either by mutation in chromosomally encoded genes or by the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of multidrug resistance by P. aeruginosa isolates requires several different genetic events, including acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. <b>Hypermutation</b> favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in integrons favors the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants.

40|$|SummaryThe human APOBEC 3 G protein {{restricts the}} {{replication}} of Vif-deficient HIV- 1 by deaminating nascent viral cDNA cytosines to uracils, leading to viral genomic strand G-to-A <b>hypermutations</b> [1 – 4]. However, the HIV- 1 Vif protein triggers APOBEC 3 G degradation, which {{helps to explain}} why this innate defense does not protect patients [5]. The APOBEC 3 G-Vif interaction is a promising therapeutic target, but {{the benefit of the}} enabling of HIV- 1 restriction in patients is unlikely to be known until Vif antagonists are developed. As a necessary prelude to such studies, cell-based HIV- 1 evolution experiments were done to find out whether APOBEC 3 G can provide a long-term block to Vif-deficient virus replication and, if so, whether HIV- 1 variants that resist restriction would emerge. APOBEC 3 G-expressing T cells were infected with Vif-deficient HIV- 1. Virus infectivity was suppressed in 45 / 48 cultures for more than five weeks, but replication was eventually detected in three cultures. Virus-growth characteristics and sequencing demonstrated that these isolates were still Vif-deficient and that in fact, these viruses had acquired a promoter mutation and a Vpr null mutation. Resistance occurred by a novel tolerance mechanism in which the resistant viruses packaged less APOBEC 3 G and accumulated fewer <b>hypermutations.</b> These data support the development of antiretrovirals that antagonize Vif and thereby enable endogenous APOBEC 3 G to suppress HIV- 1 replication...|$|R
