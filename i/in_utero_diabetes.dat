40|$|AIM: Recent {{evidence}} shows that adult metabolic disease may originate from an adverse fetal environment that can alter organ development and function in postnatal life. This study aimed to analyze the effect of exposure <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to maternal <b>diabetes</b> {{on the development of}} the metabolic syndrome in the offspring. METHODS: Pregnant rats were made diabetic (blood glucose was 20 mM) with a single streptozotocin injection on day 0 of gestation. Offspring from diabetic mothers (DMO) and control mothers (CMO) were followed from birth to 12 months of age. In these animals, metabolic parameters, such as glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid levels, as well as pancreatic insulin and morphology were studied. RESULTS: Compared with controls, DMO offspring had normal birth weights, but impaired postnatal growth that persisted throughout life. Metabolic tests revealed that DMO offspring also showed impaired glucose tolerance at six months associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and low insulin secretion. In older animals (12 months old), this phenotype persisted, but to a lesser extent. The DMO offspring also presented with high blood pressure and decreased levels of fasting plasma triglycerides, but normal plasma NEFA, and HDL and total cholesterol. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results show that our model of exposure <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to maternal <b>diabetes</b> led to normal birth weights, and induced transient glucose intolerance and increased blood pressure with no major effects on lipid metabolism. It also suggests that a hyperglycaemic fetal environment may be able to 2 ̆ 7 programme 2 ̆ 7 hypertension and glucose intolerance, but not alter lipid metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Background: Women with gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) pose an important {{public health problem}} because diabetes not only affects the maternal and fetal outcome, but these women and their fetuses are also at {{an increased risk of}} developing diabetes and related complications later in their life. Objectives: The study was conducted to determine the maternal and fetal outcomes of 50 diabetic vs 50 normoglycemic pregnancies. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective analytical record-based study conducted in a tertiary level hospital. Detailed information regarding maternal, fetal, and labor outcome parameters was recorded in a prestructured proforma and compared in normoglycemic and diabetic pregnancies. Results: Patients with obesity, history of diabetes in the family, spontaneous abortions, and gestational diabetes in previous pregnancies had a greater incidence of GDM in current pregnancy (P< 0. 05 for all). Hypertension, polyhydramnios, macrosomia, fetopelvic disproportion, and cesarean sections were more (P< 0. 001) among diabetic pregnancies. Congenital anomalies, polycythemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia were also observed to be more (P< 0. 05) in neonates born to diabetics, suggesting an adverse effect of hyperglycemia <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> Conclusion: <b>Diabetes</b> during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal and fetal morbidity. Therefore, early screening, detection, close monitoring, and intervention is essential to reduce maternal and fetal short- and long-term adverse effects, especially in high-risk groups. Pregnancy provides an opportunity to the clinician to control the disease process and inculcate healthy lifestyle practices in these patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of diabetes is increasing globally and India is no exception. The lifestyle modification and drug intervention {{are likely to}} delay or postpone the development of overt diabetes in persons diagnosed to have impaired glucose tolerance. This is a post primary prevention strategy. The primary prevention is more important as this effort is likely to reverse or halt the epidemic of disease. Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are an ideal group for the primary prevention of diabetes as they {{are at increased risk}} of future diabetes, predominantly type 2 diabetes, as are their children. Pima Indians have the highest {{prevalence of}} diabetes. This is attributed to the children exposed <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to maternal <b>diabetes.</b> Hence as a policy to identify GDM and its consequences on the infant, a 75 gm Oral Glucose Tolerance Test has been recommended to all Pima Indian women during the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. Ethnically Asian Indian women also have high prevalence of diabetes and the relative risk of developing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in them is 11. 3 times compared to White women. This necessitates universal screening for gestational diabetes during pregnancy in India. Probably the undiagnosed gestational diabetes that has been occurring in the past has resulted in the increased prevalence of diabetes in India. The timely action taken now in screening all pregnant women for glucose intolerance, achieving euglycemia in them and ensuring adequate nutritio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEpidemiologic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that cardiovascular risk is not only determined by conventional risk factors in adulthood, but also by early life events which may reprogram vascular function. To evaluate the effect of maternal diabetes on fetal programming of vas-cular tone in offspring and its evolution during adulthood, we investigated vascular reactivity of third order mesenteric arteries from diabetic mother offspring (DMO) and control mother offspring (CMO) aged 3 and 18 months. In arteries isolated from DMO the relaxation induced by prostacyclin analogues was reduced in both 3 -and 18 -month old animals although endothelium (acetylcholine) -mediated relaxation was reduced in 18 -month old DMO only. Endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) relaxation was not affected. Pressure-induced myogenic tone, which controls local blood flow, was reduced in 18 -month old CMO compared to 3 -month old CMO. Interestingly, myogenic tone was maintained at a high level in 18 -month old DMO even though agonist-induced vasoconstriction was not altered. These perturbations, in 18 -months old DMO rats, were associated with an increased pMLC/MLC, pPKA/PKA ratio and an activated RhoA protein. Thus, we highlighted perturbations in the reactivity of resistance mesenteric arteries in DMO, at as early as 3 months of age, followed by the maintenance of high myogenic tone in older rats. These modifications are in favour of excessive vasoconstrictor tone. These results evi-denced a fetal programming of vascular functions of resistance arteries in adult rats exposed <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to maternal <b>diabetes,</b> which could explain a re-setting of vascular functions and, at least in part, the occurrence of hypertension later in life...|$|R
40|$|Offspring {{of women}} with insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (IDDM) have a significantly lower risk of IDDM than the offspring of men with IDDM. Furthermore, a negative association {{of the risk of}} IDDM in the offspring with maternal age at delivery has been reported. This study tested the association with maternal age in an independent set of families (n = 103) in which the mother had at least one pregnancy before and after the onset of IDDM. In the 304 offspring, the mean +/- SE risk of IDDM by age 20 was 6. 0 +/- 2. 4 % for those born at maternal ages less than 25 yr, whereas, the risk was significantly lower (0. 7 +/- 0. 7 %) for those born at older maternal ages (P = 0. 03). These 304 offspring were combined with a sample of 1391 offspring previously reported for a multivariate analysis of other factors related to pregnancy. In the combined analysis, the risk of IDDM in offspring born at maternal ages greater than 25 yr was one-fifth that for offspring born to younger mothers. The risk of IDDM in the offspring was not significantly related to birth order, mother's age at first pregnancy, or the interval between pregnancies for subsequent ones. The risk for the children born before the mother's onset of diabetes was higher than that for those exposed <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> to her <b>diabetes,</b> but the difference did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, although genetic factors are important determinants of susceptibility to IDDM, exposure to maternal diabetes protects offspring from IDDM during the first 2 decades of life.

40|$|The global {{prevalence}} of type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D) {{has more than}} doubled in the last 30 years and is predicted to continue to rise at an alarming rate. The associated health and financial burdens are considerable. The aetiology of common forms of T 2 D is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. The influential role of the environment, in particular our diet and sedentary lifestyles, in diabetes risk is well established. Of major concern is the increasing {{prevalence of}} early onset T 2 D or pre-diabetic characteristics in children. In recent years, the role of the early life environment in programming diabetes risk {{has been the focus of}} numerous human and animal studies. Historical studies highlighted an association between low birthweight, a proxy for suboptimal <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> growth, and <b>diabetes</b> risk in adulthood. Over more recent years it has become apparent that a variety of expositions, including maternal obesity and/or maternal diabetes, can have a significant effect on offspring health outcomes. Further complicating matters, paternal and transgenerational transmission of T 2 D can occur thus mediating a perpetuating cycle of disease risk between generations. It is imperative for the underlying mechanisms to be elucidated so that interventions can be introduced. In doing so, it may be possible to prevent, delay or reverse a pre-programmed risk for T 2 D induced by pre- and/or postnatal environmental factors to improve health outcomes and curb premature metabolic decline. This review presents evidence for how the early life environment may programme T 2 D risk and suggests some mechanisms by which this may occur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Transfer {{of genes}} <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> via the amniotic fluid was shown {{previously}} with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) {{to be highly}} efficient. Expression for over one year was demonstrated using reporter genes. In addition, it was shown previously that transgenes delivered by this method release protein into the general circulation. Given these results experiments were designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy could result in long term physiologic modification. Methods A rAAV recombinant expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) and green fluorescent (gfp) in a polycistronic messenger was used to treat rat fetuses <b>in</b> <b>utero.</b> CNTF causes weight loss and decreased water consumption as a measurable physiologic effect. GFP was used as a marker of gene expression. Results <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> gene transfer with rAAV carrying human cntf and gfp resulted in long-term gene expression in rat. CNTF-specific physiologic effects of a decrease in weight and water intake were obtained. Expression of the GFP was documented in the treated animals at one year of age. Conclusion Given this data, <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> gene therapy with rAAV into multipotential stem cells resulted in long term systemic physiologic modification of the treated animals by the transgene product. <b>In</b> <b>utero</b> rAAV gene therapy potentially could be used for gene replacement therapy in metabolic disorders. </p...|$|R
