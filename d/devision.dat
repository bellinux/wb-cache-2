At dolivery there is approximately 50 kg weight loss. Then, similarly to the pregnant period, the body weight increases gradually until the fifth postpartum month and then increases rapidly from the sixth postpartum month. 4) In the primiparous cow, the decrement of body weight before and after delivery is larger in comparison with that of the second to fifth calving cow.

North of the Osuga River, the 102nd successfully repelled repeated assaults by 20,000 infantry and over 100 tanks of three Soviet 31st Army divisions (The 31st Army led its attack with the 88th, 336th, and 239th Rifle Divisions, supported by the 332d and 145th Tank Brigades). Soviet infantry clad in winter white advanced in echelon, their ranks interspersed with supporting tanks.

For three days and at a cost of more than half of their riflemen and most of their tanks, the Soviets hurled themselves in vain at the 102nd Division's prepared defenses. Faced with this determined resistance, the 31st Army's assault collapsed, and, despite Zhukov's and Konev's exhortations, it could not be revived.In 1943 it was involved in Operation Citadel (the Battle of Kursk) and its aftermath, losing much of its strength in a series of fierce defensive battles around Orel; by October it was listed as assigned to the Second Army and reduced to Kampfgruppe level.

40|$|Legumes {{are unique}} {{in that they are}} able to {{establish}} a mutual symbiotic interaction with nitrogen fixing soil bacteria generally referred to as rhizobia. This interaction starts off in the root epidermis where the bacterial signal molecule, the Nod factor, is perceived by the plant (Nod factor signaling). This recognition sets in motion a series of responses leading to the formation of a root nodule. This organ is specifically created to host the bacteria in an intracellular manner. The rhizobia develop into a mature, nitrogen fixing state in these infected cells. The rhizobia are surrounded by a host membrane and this forms a cell wall free symbiotic interface, that allows the exchange of nutrients between the symbionts. The comparison of the mechanism controlling symbiotic interface formation in rhizobium symbiosis and the much more common symbiosis with arbusucal micorrhizal (AM) fungi strongly suggest that rhizobia co-opted parts of the AM symbiosis. The signalling as well as cellular processes controlling symbiotic interface formation in the ancient AM symbiosis have been recruited by the rhizobium nodule symbiosis. In this thesis I present the results of my research on the role of and mechanisms controling Nod factor signalling on symbiotic interface formation in nodules of the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago). To study the role of Nod factor signaling in the formation of a symbiotic interface it was essential to define a fate map for Medicago root nodules. The formation of a nodule starts, after Nod factor perception in the epidermis, with divisions in the cortex, pericycle and endodermis. <b>Devisions</b> in the cortex start from the inner most layer and spread outwards. When cortical layer 4 (C 4) and C 5 have already divided a few times, mitotic activity is induced in C 3 and ultimately C 2 divides. After the first periclinal divisions have been induced in C 3, cells derived from C 4 and C 5 stop dividing and form about 8 cell layers. C 3 continues to divide and ultimately forms the nodule meristem. The infection thread that developed in the root hairs has to penetrate the primordium before the first periclinal divisions occur in C 3. The cells derived from C 4 and C 5 are then infected by bacteria from the infection thread in the primordium. After the establishment of a meristem this meristem adds new cells to the nodule, which are gradually infected when they leave the meristem and enter the infection zone. The fate map shows that formation of the symbiotic interface occurs in two ways: first in cells of the primordium and later in the infection zone in daughter cells derived from the meristem. For the infection of daughter cells derived from the meristem the Nod factor receptors (NFP and LYK 3 in Medicago) are needed, most likely to perceive the Nod factor. When we knocked down one of the receptors in a nodule specific manner release of bacteria is hampered (NFP) or massive unwalled droplets were observed (LYK 3) indicating most likely slow release. This shows that the receptors are needed for the formation of the symbiotic interface in the nodule. In line with this function in the infection zone we found the receptors to accumulate in the nodule apex. The receptors accumulate in a narrow zone of two cell layers that is the border between the merisitem and the infection zone. The receptors accumulate to a zone markedly narrower than the zone where the promoters are activity. In this narrow zone the receptors accumulate at the cell periphery, most likely the plasma membrane. Outside this layer we observed accumulation of the receptors in the vacuoles suggesting degradation. In cells with LYK 3 at the plasma membrane LYK 3 occurs only in 35 % of the cells at the membrane surrounding infection threads. The removal of LYK 3 from the plasma membrane appears to be first completed at the membrane surrounding the infection thread. As the receptors are expressed in a broader zone, post-transcriptional mechanisms limit their accumulation at the plasma membrane. Ectopic expression experiments show that broader expression, and most likely accumulation, could induce defence responses (NFP) and reduces infection (LYK 3). Therefore the accumulation of the receptors needs to be limited and the receptors are only allowed to accumulate in a narrow zone where Nod factor perception could take place. As both receptors accumulate in the same cell layers we tested whether they form heteromeric complexes. It was already proposed at their discovery that NFP and LYK 3 should form a complex based on their phenotype and the lack of an active kinase domain in NFP. Also most receptors form complexes to modulate their (kinase) activity. We show that a heteromeric complex is also formed in the proper biological context in nodules. The cell death responses that are induced when the receptors are co-expressed in heterologous systems are avoided in Medicago nodules. Also homomeric complexes containing LYK 3 were observed in nodules. This homomeric complex is formed either as an addition to the heteromeric complex with NFP or the complex with NFP contains multiple LYK 3 molecules. As receptors often function in larger complexes we performed immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to detect possible interactors of LYK 3. With this we detected several proteins interactors of LYK 3 including a EF 1 α, Dynamin- 2 B, PR 10, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and 14 - 3 - 3 f 2 protein. Some of these proteins have a function in the regulation of vesicle transport and the cytoskeleton. Remarkable, other known or putative interactors of LYK 3 (NFP, PUB 1, SYMREM 1 and FLOT 4) were not detected. To test why we could not find these interactors we performed co-localization experiments. These experiments show that the interaction with SYMREM 1 and the putative interaction with FLOT 4 could take place as both proteins co-localize with LYK 3. SYMREM 1 accumulates at the membrane surrounding the infection threads and at the symbiosomes. As LYK 3 also, although transient, accumulates at the membrane surrounding the infection threads, LYK 3 and SYREM 1 co-localize there. This shows that these interactors could form a complex with LYK 3, although the complex is most likely very transient. This transient nature makes the complexes difficult to detect. Because co-localization is a prerequisite for two proteins to interact we studied the expression of the Medicago genome. We used laser capture micro-dissection experiment to isolate RNA from different zones of the nodules and measured the differential expression of the Medicago genome. This experiments provides us with a digital in situ experiment for Medicago nodules. The data show that the genes from the Nod factor signaling cascade do not show the same expression pattern. The Nod factor receptor mRNAs of NFP and LYK 3 are enriched in the meristem and distal infection zone. This is in line with our localization studies where the receptors accumulate at the border between meristem and infection zone. Most genes from the Nod factor signaling cascade show no differential expression at all (expressed equal in the entire nodule), where in situ or promoter GUS studies show enrichment of all these genes in the meristem/ infection zone. Further, some show remarkable behaviour. DMI 1 and IPD 3, for instance, are enriched in infected cells. These data could point to a new function for these proteins which is not related to the known signaling cascade. Also a survey on the differential expression of other LysM domain containing proteins show that there are more candidates that may have an important role in Nod factor perception. These LysM domain containing proteins are also enriched in the mersitem and/or infection zone and could thus function as a co-receptor for NFP or LYK 3. Nod factor perception is the key step in the progress of the rhizobium – legume symbiosis. Not only in the early steps in the root epidermis, but also in the nodule. Because of the developmental gradient in the indeterminate Medicago nodule this nodule is a perfect biological system to study the cell biology of the symbiosis. The differential expression analysis and the nodule fate map are important tools for these studies...|$|R

L'auteur décrit les formes qu'elle peut prendre dans notre système démocratique et en admet deux: l'orientation et l'action directe non-partisane. Il rejette l'action directe partisane. Politics has as object the {{settling}} {{of relations}} {{between the government and}} the governed in order to realize the common good. In democratic countries the citizens are the final authority in the State and they may as of right and in fact, elect the government of their choice and insist that it legislate and administrate in the way desired by the majority. In order to play an enlightened role, the citizen must form an accurate opinion on society's problems. It is also necessary that he may, by appropriate ways, act on his government either to guide it or to control its actions. May the union enlighten the citizen on political problems? May it influence the government in favour of the workers and in what way? In order to reply to these questions, it is necessary to place the union in the life of the nation and analyze the merits of the techniques of the following political action:THE NATURE OF UNIONISM AND ITS INTEREST IN POLITICSA union has not only the right but also the duty to use all legitimate means that will allow it to ensure the study, defense and promotion of the professional, economic and social interests of its members as long as the resort to any means, even honest, does not divert it from its objective. Traditionally, unions had devoted all their energies to the organization of the profession and to the negotiation of collective agreements, using occasionally their right to strike. These traditional means of action are still essential to the survival of unionism and to the promotion of the members' welfare. Hut they are not enough, if the predominant effect of politics on the life of the worker and of his union is taken into effect. Government action constantly affects unions and their members in matters beyond the scope of the collective agreement and which can only be studied on their true merits in the political sphere. In a true democracy, a government could not keep in power if, by its actions it no longer represented the will of the majority. The role of government is to reconcile the interests of all individuals and all groups, and not to impose programmes which do not truly represent popular needs. In so far as individuals and movements will be ready to finally come to the necessary compromise in order to realize the common good, it is essential that they be at liberty to express their demands and even their dissatisfaction. It is then, in so far as each movement or individual does not try to restrict or hinder similar liberty of otheT movements or individuals, that our laws will truly reflect the popular will. There is, therefore, no valid principle which might prevent unions from influencing the government in a way that is in conformity to their real interests and to demand their just share in national politics. First technique of political action : INDIRECT ACTIONOR POLITICAL ORIENTATIONA union carries out indirect political action, or political orientation, when it does not try to use the government or the machinery of government, to control or to influence relations of a political nature. If it limits itself to political orientation, the union only makes known to its members or to the public, its legislative demands and requests them either to take them into account when voting or to support them in regard to the government. It does not take any official position on the subject of candidates, parties or political programmes. It does not indicate how or for whom to vote. This technique has therefore no other aim than the civic education of members and citizens. A labour movement that is really responsible must accept its true role in the life of the nation. It must b e integrated in the nation, establish its programme of action and make it known to all those who are affected by the labour movement: government, employers and others. All workers are certainly not union members, but it would be against the spirit of democracy to ignore the well-deserved demands of union leaders. One of the main functions of parties and governments is to reconcile the divergence of interests in the country. It is therefore not only useful but essential that individuals or groups make known their needs. Thus union political orientation cannot prove an obstacle in the real task of democratic parties or governments. Union political orientation is necessary, as the unions must be heard by the government just the same as any other group of citizens. This is a fundamental right of unionism in the modern state. This right should be encouraged and developed, as otherwise the machinery of government, of which the task is precisely to reconcile different programmes or demands coming from different environments, in order to make its acts conform to the common good, may be put out of line. Second technique : NON-PARTISAN DIRECT ACTIONA union carries out non-partisan direct action if it limits itself to influencing the government or the representatives of the people, by manoeuvering, controlling or influencing one or several elements in the government machinery, but without desiring to exercise power itself or take the responsibility for the administration. A non-partisan union expects to remain independent in spite of the support that it feels it must grant either to a programme or to candidates or to a party favourable to the union. In other words, by refusing to identify itself with political parties or candidates, it prevents them from interfering in its own business. In taking sides for a candidate or a party, the union does not intend to suppress all opposition to the political programme that it proposes. It only wishes that government ac'ion encourage true harmony between employers and workers and not be influenced only by groups that are hostile or indifferent to the welfare of the workers. With this aim in view but without affiliating itself, the movement will support the candidates or the party which voluntarily accepts the legislation proposed as being in 'he best interests of the nation. But this political action does not in any way force a member to become affiliated to a party or even to vote one way or another. No doubt non-partisan political action offers some danger for the worker's movement. In a country like ours where several organizations are preferred to a single labour movement, it would be possible to see various movements supporting candidates belonging to opposite sides. A lack of foresight and carefulness, untimely gestures could bring about serious <b>devisions</b> within a movement. No doub, more experience will permit the unions to get around the dangers inherent in all direct political action. It is normal for the unions to constantly inform their members, as much on the probable effect of the political programmes on unionism, as on the character, honesty and capaci'ies of those who desire to be in power, if the members decide that such a non-partisan political action is honest and appropriate to the desired aims of the union, and the union movement will not be diver'ed from its objectives, they must decide themselves on the risks of this action and its intensity. Third technique : DIRECT PARTISAN ACTIONBy direct and partisan union political action, is meant all political action of the union of which the aim would be to ultimately secure power and exercise it, either alone or with other powerful associations federated in a party. Here we are using the term partisan in its most restric'ed sense. A union is partisan not because it gives some kind of support to a party but because as a union, it identifies itself with a party and becomes a part of it and as such, tries to exercise the power. The great majority of Canadian workers grouped in unions refuse to accept the formula of direct partisan action. Logically a union could then only exercise power by delegating members to the party itself. In parliamentary rule, where a strong party discipline is necessary, a union could not keep all its liberty of action without risking to break with the party itself. The effect would be a weakening if not the downfall of a government which must be stable for the length of its mandate. In a short time, it would be the ruin of democracy. By following partisan action, affiliating itself with a party, the union would rapidly become a pure and simple instrument of government. With the undoubtedly rapid interference of Candida'es or parties in the internal affairs of the union, there would be the danger that the political affiliation of the member becomes a condition of admittance to the union. This consequence would go against a condition of true unionism which is the admittance of a member without question as to his legitimate political affiliation. Otherwise, it would only be party considerations which would regulate the relations within a union. CONCLUSIONPolitical nction, even if it remains at the political orientation s'age, is a necessity in any labour movement, in view of the complexity and the interdependence of modern life. Direct and non-partisan action is possible provided that the union remains truly independent of all political connections. The extent of this non-partisan action still remains a question for the members to decide, at the same time using much care in such a delicate and explosive matter. We believe, however, that the policy of direct affiliation (direct partisan action), will not suit the true needs of unionism. In view of the present political situation in the country, the state of mind of the electors and the majority of union members, such a policy of direct partisan action would be, in our opinion, to the great disadvantage of our unions...|$|R
