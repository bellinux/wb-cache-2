25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E
25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E

2500|$|In a Talking to Americans {{segment on}} the Canadian mock {{television}} news show This Hour Has 22 Minutes during the 2000 American election, comedian Rick Mercer posed {{as a reporter}} and asked several people (including then-Texas governor George W. Bush) {{what they thought of}} [...] "Prime Minister Jean Poutine" [...] and his endorsement of Bush for president. (The Prime Minister of Canada at the time was Jean Chrétien.) None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of [...] "Poutine". A few years later when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as President, he joked during a speech, [...] "I told [...] Paul [...] that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that endorsement. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> meet Jean Poutine."

6000|$|Sigel's {{record is}} almost equally brief.

He will do nothing but run; never did anything else."

6000|$|The {{first she}} opened was from Miss Pinnegar--all war {{and fear and}} anxiety. The second was a letter, a real {{insulting}} letter from Dr. Mitchell.

So your fair-seeming face covered the schemes and vice of your true nature.

60|$|Investigation {{proved the}} surmise correct. Fortunately I was still alone, and in {{consequence}} was able, {{a few minutes}} later, to meet my hostess with calm and dignity. I said nothing about the rocking-chair. As a matter of fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> have the pleasure, before I went, of seeing some other guest arrive and sample it: I had purposely replaced it in the most prominent and convenient position. But though I felt capable of schooling myself to silence, I found myself unable to agree with my hostess when she called for my admiration of the thing. My recent experiences had too deeply embittered me.|$|E

[...] "In the midst of those trophies of Poynton, living with them, {{touching}} them, using them, I felt as if I were backing her up. As I was not {{a bit of an}} accomplice, as I hate what she has done, I didn't want to be, even to the extent of the mere look of it--what is it you call such people?--an accessory after the fact." [...] There was something she kept back so rigidly that the joy of uttering the rest was double. She felt the sharpest need of giving him all the other truth. There was a matter as to which she had deceived him, and there was a matter as to which she had deceived Mrs. Gereth, but her lack of pleasure in deception as such came home to her now. She busied herself with the tea and, to extend the occupation, cleared the table still more, spreading out the coarse cups and saucers and the vulgar little plates. She was aware that she produced more confusion than symmetry, but she was also aware that she was violently nervous. Owen tried to help her with something: this made rather for disorder. [...] "My reason for not writing to you," [...] she pursued, [...] "was simply that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> hear more from Ricks. I've waited from day to day for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'After the service, I laid {{hold of the}} urchin whose hearty stare {{had most}} {{reminded}} me of Tom Madison, {{and gave him a}} shilling to guide me back to Oakstead, a wise measure, for down came the cloud, blotting all out like the Castle of St. John, and by the time I came home, it was pitch dark and raining hard, and my poor father was imagining me at the foot of another precipice. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> creep up in secret, but they all came out, fell upon me, Lady Oakstead sent me tea, and ordered me to rest; and so handsomely did I obey, that when next I opened my eyes, and saw my father waiting, as I thought, for me to go down to dinner with him, I found he had just come up after the ladies had quitted the dining-room. So kind and so little annoyed did he seem, that I shook myself, to be certified that I had broken no more bones, but it was all sheer forbearance and consideration--enough to go to one's heart--when it was the very thing to vex him most. With great penitence, I went down, and the first person I encountered was the very curate I had seen in my misterious village, much as if he had walked out of a story book. On fraternizing, I found him to be a friend of Holdsworth. Lady Oakstead is going to take me, this afternoon, to see his church, &c., thoroughly; and behold, I learn from him that she is a notable woman for doing good in her parish, never so happy as in trotting to cottages, though her good deeds are always in the background. Thereupon, I ventured to attack her this morning on cottage garniture, and obtained the very counsel I wanted about ovens and piggeries, we began to get on together, and she is to put me up to all manner of information that I want particularly. I must go now, not to keep her waiting, never mind the first half of my letter--I have no time to cancel it now. I find my father wants to put in a note: don't believe a word that he says, for I am much better to-day, body and mind.|$|E
