500|$|The station's {{importance}} remained {{through the}} first half of the 20th century. After the Boston & Albany was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900, third and fourth tracks were extended in 1907 to South Framingham from Lake Crossing station in Wellesley. In 1911, the NYC considered laying third rail on the main line as far as South Framingham, as well as on the Highland Branch, to allow more frequent electric service on the lines. This would have been the only electrified commuter service directly into Boston, as neither the later-electrified Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad nor experimental electric service on the South Shore Railroad went directly to downtown. However, the plan was abandoned because the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> would have exceeded the annual savings on fuel. (In 1959, the Highland Branch received catenary wire and was turned into the Green Line [...] "D" [...] Branch).|$|E

2500|$|Cost {{recovery}} varies between utilities. The {{collection rate}} (i.e. {{the shares of}} bills actually paid) in Beirut-Mount Lebanon has been consistent at almost 90%, so that the utility had accumulated over US$170 million as cash surplus in 2010. However, as of 2010 it {{was estimated to be}} only 62%. In the three other Regional Water Establishments collection rates are lower at 58% in the North, 52% in the South and only 18% in the Bekaa. In the three Establishments not even operating costs are recovered. The Government often steps in to pay for operating expenses in addition to financing investments in water <b>infrastructure.</b> <b>Cost</b> recovery is lowest for the Bekaa water company. According to a World Bank report, [...] "there appears to be an informal understanding between water companies and households: many households don’t receive their water allotment, and the water companies often don’t pressure households to pay their bills." [...] Given the current conditions and alternatives, households have stated in surveys that they are reluctant to pay more for [...] better public [...] service. Even where meters have been installed, there is no volumetric tariff. Flat fees are charged regardless of the existence of the meters. There thus is no financial incentive to save water. There is also no wastewater tariff.|$|E

50|$|City Life has {{a simple}} economy. Each {{building}} has <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> which {{are paid by}} {{the city to the}} business, including fixed costs and costs which are related to the number of employees a building requires. Roads, bridges, parks and monuments also count as buildings in this way. Buildings also have indirect costs with regards the energy they consume and waste they produce. Buildings which represent businesses also generate income which is taxed and is paid back to the city. Therefore, the monthly budget for the city (i.e. for the player) is calculated by taking the taxed income and subtracting the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> for each building. For example, the basic industrial building has $50 of fixed <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> and generates up to $100 in revenue tax per worker. When staffed with 3 workers the net profit for the city is thus $250 per month.|$|R
