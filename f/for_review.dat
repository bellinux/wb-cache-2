5|$|Since {{achieving}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia, Croatia has submitted 26 films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as of 2016, but none have {{been nominated for}} an Oscar.

Since independence, five Croatian directors have had multiple films submitted to the Academy <b>for</b> <b>review.</b> Directors Branko Schmidt, Arsen Anton Ostojić and Zrinko Ogresta had three of their films selected, and two other directors had two films submitted– Vinko Brešan and Dalibor Matanić.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} <b>for</b> <b>review</b> of {{detention}} is {{a remedy for}} establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful.

5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for an order <b>for</b> <b>review</b> of detention {{differs from that}} for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order <b>for</b> <b>review</b> of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{requested that}} the U.S. Supreme Court stay the order requiring Bakke's admission pending its filing a petition asking <b>for</b> <b>review.</b> U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, as circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit (which includes California) granted the stay for the court in November 1976.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order <b>for</b> <b>review</b> of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order <b>for</b> <b>review</b> of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E

5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and <b>for</b> <b>review</b> by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E

For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, some 43 {{days after}} Kepler came online, its {{operating}} scientists submitted {{a list of}} over 700 exoplanet candidates <b>for</b> <b>review.</b> Of those, five were originally suspected {{to have more than}} one planet. Kepler-9 was one of the multiplanetary systems; it was identified as such when scientists noticed significant variations in the time intervals at which Kepler-9 was transited. Kepler-9 holds the first multiplanetary system discovered using the transit method. It is also the first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method, allowing to calculate the masses of planets. The discovery of the planets was announced on August 26, 2010.|$|E
