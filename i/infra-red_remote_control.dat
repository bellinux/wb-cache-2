25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R

Both methods were designed for use with a common <b>infra-red</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> Each character is entered using two keystrokes. After one hour and forty minutes of practice, split into 5 sessions, the participants were able to type faster than 9 words per minute. While the performance of both methods was similar, the TwiceTap required {{a smaller number of}} keystrokes per character, was less prone to errors, and was found to be more comfortable by the participants. Over time, the use of frequent n-grams in TwiceTap was reinforced while the use of infrequent n-grams was suppressed...|$|E

40|$|Biological organisms employ {{binocular}} {{visual and}} binaural hearing systems, {{as well as}} movement, to gather sensory information from multiple viewpoints for accurate sensory perception. In contrast, artificial sensory systems typically use either a multitude of sensors in a static array, or employ motion from a single mobile robotic platform. The goal of this project {{is to build a}} small prototype of an adaptive, distributed network consisting of small, modular sensors and actuating components that will accurately position sensors at multiple 3 -dimensional spatial locations and yield sensory information from multiple viewpoints. A working prototype of a single sensor node system was built, using a simple motorized spool design and a Motorola HC 11 microcontroller. Control of the system was implemented in C and assembly to position a single sensor node in a 2 -dimensional space.
