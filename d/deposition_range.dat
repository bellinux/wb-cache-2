50|$|Around 5.9 {{million years}} ago, the {{connection}} between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt <b>deposition</b> <b>range,</b> during {{what is known as the}} Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.|$|E

30|$|The in situ electrospinning {{needs to}} {{precisely}} control the <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> on a specified tumor tissue, which could avoid causing serious tissue adhesion {{especially in the}} abdominal cavity [14]. It has been reported by many researchers that the in situ precise electrospinning can be applied {{in the field of}} medicine [15]. Recent studies demonstrated the use of airflow-directed in situ electrospinning device to enhance the precise deposition of ultrathin polymeric fibers onto wound sites [16]. However, airflow-directed in situ electrospinning device need to add an extra air pump, an additional home-made handle with a spinneret head, and other air flow-assisted device compared to the traditional electrospinning apparatus, and need to coordinate the air flow and the relationship between the speed and voltage, which makes the operation of the apparatus complicated. Magnetic field-assisted electrospinning is also an effective way to prepare ordered electrospun fibers and control the <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> of electrospun fibers [17]. The macromolecular polymers incorporating enough magnetic particles can induce sufficient magnetic susceptibility to the polymeric solution. Yang et al. [18] reported an approach for fabrication of well-aligned arrays and multilayer grids by a method called magnetic electrospinning (MES). In the MES, a small amount of magnetic nanoparticles is added to magnetize the polymer solution. A magnetic field generated by two parallel positioned permanent magnets is applied during electrospinning, and the magnetic field stretches the fibers across the gap to form a parallel array. However, the magnetic field-assisted electrospinning can only be used for the preparation of magnetic fibers, which has no effect on the spinning process for non-magnetic fibers. In contrast, the use of an auxiliary electrode in the in situ precise electrospinning to achieve the magnetic composite fibrous membranes is a more simple, effective, and universal method.|$|E

30|$|In summary, a {{magnetic}} composite nanofiber membrane was fabricated in situ using a portable electrospinning device {{with the aid}} of an auxiliary electrode. In the electrospinning process, the addition of the auxiliary electrode prolongs the stable area of the electrospinning and reduces the fiber whipping, thereby reducing the <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> of the fiber and accelerating the fiber deposition rate. For electrospinning techniques, the application of conical auxiliary electrodes to precisely control the deposition area is suitable for most electrospinning materials. Moreover, the microstructure (diameter, surface morphology) of the electrospinning fiber is not significantly affected. The in situ prepared magnetic composite nanofibrous membranes can convert the AMF energy to the thermal energy to elevate temperature efficiently. With the aid of the auxiliary electrode, the composite fibrous membrane prepared by in situ electrospinning showed efficient heating ability upon the application of AMF, and well-maintained cyclic heating performance under the presence of AMF. These results indicate that the magnetic composite fibrous membrane prepared in situ by the auxiliary electrode is an excellent candidate for the magnetic hyperthermia of cancer therapy.|$|E

Fifty two heathlands were selected across an N deposition gradient of 5. 9 to 32. 4 kg ha 21 yr 21. The diversity and abundance of higher and lower plants and a suite of biogeochemical measures were evaluated in relation to climate and N deposition indices.

Early observational studies and research using artificial N applications have identified N deposition as the primary driver of heathland succession into grassland or woodland, and N enrichment is considered a threat to heathland sustainability. This study investigated soil fertility and vegetation composition at 25 lowland heathland sites in low rainfall regions of mainland Britain within a modelled wet N <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> of 1. 85 to 10. 90 kg N ha- 1 y- 1. A bioassay approach was used to quantify relationships between soil fertility and N deposition, heathland patch size and the management regimes.

No relationship between N enrichment and N : P mass ratio was found suggesting no N induced shift to P limitation. It was determined that soil phosphomonoesterase activity was not up-regulated in response to N enrichment. This suggests that the soil P reserves are sufficient to satisfy demand under current N deposition loads.

The HIB has remarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion: in particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~ 30 - 40 %, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be ~ 50 - 70 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with the standard energy output of 1 GW of electricity. The HIF reactor operation frequency would be ~ 10 ~ 15 Hz or so. Several- MJ HIBs illuminate a fusion fuel target, and the fuel target is imploded to about a thousand times of the solid density. Then the DT fuel is ignited and burned. The HIB ion <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> {{is defined by the}} HIB ions stopping length, which would be ~ 1 mm or so depending on the material. Therefore, a relatively large density-scale length appears in the fuel target material. One of the critical issues in inertial fusion would be a spherically uniform target compression, which would be degraded by a non-uniform implosion. The implosion non-uniformity would be introduced by the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability, and the large density-gradient-scale length helps to reduce the R-T growth rate.

The enhanced surface diffusion at 700  °C drove the Pd nanostructures to be a more stable configuration by minimizing surface energy such that the Pd NPs at 10 and 15  nm in the 700  °C set were much rounder. The evolution of surface morphology is also clearly evidenced by the cross-sectional line profiles, FFT power spectra, and the summary plots of Rq and SAR and summarized in Additional file 1 : Table S 4. The Raman spectra and their peak position, FWHM, and peak counts were also varied accordingly with the various morphologies of Pd nanostructures with increased deposition amount between 0.5 and 100  nm as clearly shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 11 and summarized in Additional file 1 : Table S 5. The reflectance spectra in Additional file 1 : Figure S 12 also showed similar behavior in correlation with the surface morphology as described for the previous set. Meanwhile, annealing at comparatively low temperature of 450  °C resulted in the very small Pd grains on top over the Pd layer due to the limited diffusion of Pd adatoms as clearly illustrated by the AFM images, line profiles, FFT power spectra, RMS roughness, surface area ratio, EDS spectra, and Raman and reflectance spectra in Additional file 1 : Figures S 13 –S 17 and Additional file 1 : Tables S 4 and S 5.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{diseases}} {{represent a}} growing {{threat to the}} global food supply. The factors contributing to pathogen transmission from plant to plant remain poorly understood. Statistical correlations between rainfalls and plant disease out- breaks were reported; however, the detailed mechanisms linking the two were relegated to a black box. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, {{we focus on the}} impact dynamics of raindrops on infected leaves, one drop at a time. We find that the <b>deposition</b> <b>range</b> of most of the pathogen-bear- ing droplets is constrained by a hydrodynamical condition and we quantify the effect of leaf size and compliance on such constraint. Moreover, we identify and characterize two dominant fluid fragmentation scenarios as responsible for the dispersal of most pathogen-bearing droplets emitted from infected leaves: (i) the crescent-moon ejection is driven by the direct interaction between the impacting raindrop and the contaminated sessile drop and (ii) the inertial detachment is driven by the motion imparted to the leaf by the raindrop, lead- ing to catapult-like droplet ejections. We find that at first, decreasing leaf size or increasing compliance reduces the range of pathogen-bearing droplets and the subsequent epidemic onset efficiency. However, this conclusion only applies for the crescent moon ejection. Above a certain compliance threshold a more effective mechanism of contaminated fluid ejection, the inertial detachment, emerges. This compliance threshold is determined by the ratio between the leaf velocity and the characteristic velocity of fluid fragmentation. The inertial detachment mechanism enhances the range of deposition of the larger con- taminated droplets and suggests a change in epidemic onset pattern and a more efficient potential of infection of neighbouring plants. Dimensionless parameters and scaling laws are provided to rationalize our observations. Our results link {{for the first time the}} mechanical properties of foliage with the onset dynamics of foliar epidemics through the lens of fluid fragmentation. We discuss how the reported findings can inform the design of mitigation strategies acting at the early stage of a foliar disease outbreak. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDue to the {{potential}} ecological effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems from atmospheric deposition in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), Alberta, Canada, this study was implemented to estimate atmospheric nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) inputs. Passive samplers were used to measure ambient concentrations of ammonia (NH 3), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitric acid/nitrous acid (HNO 3 /HONO), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) in the AOSR. Concentrations of NO 2 and SO 2 in winter were higher than those in summer, while seasonal differences of NH 3 and HNO 3 /HONO showed an opposite trend, with higher values in summer. Concentrations of NH 3, NO 2 and SO 2 were high close to the emission sources (oil sands operations and urban areas). NH 3 concentrations were also elevated in the southern portion of the domain indicating possible agricultural and urban emission sources to the southwest. HNO 3, an oxidation endpoint, showed wider ranges of concentrations and a larger spatial extent. Concentrations of NH 3, NO 2, HNO 3 /HONO and SO 2 from passive measurements and their monthly deposition velocities calculated by a multi-layer inference model (MLM) were used to calculate dry deposition of N and S. NH 3 contributed the largest fraction of deposited N across the network, ranging between 0. 70 – 1. 25 kgNha− 1 yr− 1, HNO 3 /HONO <b>deposition</b> <b>ranged</b> between 0. 30 – 0. 90 kgNha− 1 yr− 1, and NO 2 deposition between 0. 03 – 0. 70 kgNha− 1 yr− 1. During the modeled period, average dry deposition of the inorganic gaseous N species ranged between 1. 03 and 2. 85 kgNha− 1 yr− 1 and SO 4 -S <b>deposition</b> <b>ranged</b> between 0. 26 and 2. 04 kgha− 1 yr− 1. Comparisons with co-measured ion exchange resin throughfall data (8. 51 kgSha− 1 yr− 1) indicate that modeled dry deposition combined with measured wet deposition (1. 37 kgSha− 1 yr− 1) underestimated S deposition. Gas phase NH 3 (71 %) and HNO 3 plus NO 2 (79 %) dry deposition fluxes dominated the total deposition of NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{performed}} to analyse how deposition efficiency from an axial-fan sprayer was affected by the canopy structure of vines trained to the High Cordon, Low Cordon and Casarsa systems, at beginning of flowering and beginning of berry touch growth stages. An empirical calibration method, providing a dose rate adjustment roughly proportional to canopy height, was used. The canopy structure was assessed using the Point Quadrat method, and determining the leaf area index (LAI) and the leaf layer index (LLI). Spray deposits were measured by colorimetry, using a water soluble dye (Tartrazine) as a tracer. Correlation between deposits and canopy parameters were analysed and discussed. Foliar deposits per unit leaf area were relatively constant, suggesting that empirical calibration can reduce deposit variability associated with different training systems and growth stages. Total foliar <b>deposition</b> <b>ranged</b> from 33. 6 % and 82. 3 % of total spray volume, and increased proportionally with the LLI up to LLI 40 % gaps in the foliage both reduced total deposition, and may increase the risk for larger drift losses...|$|R
40|$|Performance and {{reliability}} of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) components enhanced dramatically through the incorporation of protective thin film coatings. Current-generation MEMS devices prepared by the LIGA technique employ transition metals such as Ni, Cu, Fe, or alloys thereof, and hence lack stability in oxidizing, corrosive, and/or high temperature environments. Fabrication of a superhard, self-lubricating coating based on a ternary boride compound AlMgB 14 is described in this letter as a potential breakthrough in protective coating technology for LIGA microdevices. Nanoindentation tests show that hardness of AlMgB 14 films prepared by pulsed laser <b>deposition</b> <b>ranges</b> from 45 GPa to 51 GPa, when deposited at room temperature and 573 K, respectively. Extremely low friction coefficients of 0. 04 - 0. 05, which are thought to result from a self-lubricating effect, have also been confirmed by nanoscratch tests on the AlMgB 14 films. Transmission electron microscopy {{studies show that the}} as-deposited films are amorphous, regardless of substrate temperature; however, analysis of FTIR spectra suggests that the higher substrate temperature facilitates formation of the B 12 icosahedral framework, therefore leading to the higher hardness...|$|R
