5000|$|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), film {{written by}} Jack B. Sowards and {{directed}} by Nicholas Meyer. The film opens with a space battle between the USS Enterprise and a Klingon ship {{that turns out to}} be a simulation: the Kobayashi Maru test for cadets pursuing the command track at Starfleet Academy. This simulation confronts the subject with a moral and strategic dilemma. Should she rescue the <b>disabled</b> <b>civilian</b> vessel Kobayashi Maru if it means violating a peace treaty with the Klingons and the risk of war, or should he observe the spatial proscriptions of the treaty and abandon the ship to certain extinction? The city Amber on Tau Ceti IV is the homeport of the 3rd class neutronic fuel carrier Kobayashi Maru, and her master Kojiro Vance.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or <b>disable</b> <b>civilian</b> employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|R
5000|$|States of European {{continent}} {{took the}} issue of disability after the World War I when disability protection system was covering only war veterans, soldiers. This system {{was based on the}} conviction that people are owned this protection (quotas) for those who have hurt protecting their country, that was known as a Quid pro quo duty, what meant something for something. Everything changed in the post World War II period. War left Europe in devastated condition. Millions of people were irreversible injured. That lead to the very high level of unemployment among the disabled parts of societies. After 1945, European states were forced by this situation to made employers to employ disabled veterans. Later those post War quatas were extended into the <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Community {{services}} are {{the cornerstone of}} New Zealand Red Cross work. Two of these services {{have a long history}} in New Zealand - Community Transport and Meals On Wheels. Community Transport grew from the transportation of sick and wounded returned servicemen to medical appointments and outings in World War II. After the war the Transport Corps extended their activities to <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians</b> as well as servicemen. Community Transport continues to take people to doctor appointments and hospital visits who otherwise {{may not be able to}} get there. The Meals On Wheels programme was started in June 1951 by the North Canterbury Red Cross Centre during a gas, coal and electricity shortage when the volunteers decided to make soup for people in need. A local café proprietor, offered to cook stock for the soup and deliver it for free and a local butcher supplied the bones and meat for the soup to Red Cross free of charge. In 2014, 544,843 meals were delivered around New Zealand.|$|R

All eight face additional charges of kidnapping, conspiracy, larceny, assault and housebreaking or unlawfully entering a dwelling. Five of the men are accused of making a false official statement.|$|R

Jim refuses to believe Silver is in league with the Procyons, but is heartbroken as he sees Silver <b>disable</b> a <b>civilian</b> ship and force it into a black hole. Now {{determined}} that Silver is not the man he once knew, he pursues Silver to a Pirate fortress.|$|R
40|$|Disability and Personhood are two {{ideas that}} meet in unfortunate circumstances. Persons with disabilities have their identities {{challenged}} {{as they are}} repeatedly seen as persons with less social stature. They are overlooked in obtaining jobs {{and when they do}} have jobs, they are overlooked for promotion as they are seen as less able to perform the duties the job requires. Persons with disabilities are subject to the stares of others, often a focus of the ire of the public for perceived advantages such as specialty parking. Recent civil rights law protects their rights, but the public is slow to accommodate the needs of this class of people. Cities still run special paratransit lines rather than modify their city buses, perpetuating 'separate but equal'. It is an issue found in our literature and disabled children do not have same educational access as those that are able bodied. Public perception and public reaction is of national concern, especially when the needs of the few seem to trample on the needs of the many. Disabled lives matter, the same as the able bodied. Public perception of our returning soldiers is admirable and it is spilling over into the lives of <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b> It is an issue that needs wider acknowledgement and effort from everyday people to permit disabled persons to live fuller lives.

5000|$|The century {{began as}} had the {{previous}} one. This period of quiet lasted for {{almost the entire}} {{first half of the}} twentieth century, with no particular significant events. In this period, the Scuola del Libro (Istituto per la Decorazione e l'Illustrazione del Libro) was founded and expressed considerable talent both nationally and internationally. In addition to the artistic development from the Scuola del Libro, Urbino also began to grow as a university town, with the elevation to university faculty of nineteenth-century School of Pharmacy and the birth of the department of Education (approximately 1934). Due to these changes in the University, an increase in the student population led to housing shortages that highlighted the state of total unpreparedness of the city, so much that for the first time many students were housed in the homes of private citizens. The problem was partly solved with the establishment of the male boarding school [...] "Raphael" [...] at the beginning of the century, and the female boarding school [...] "Laura Battiferri" [...] in approximately 1926. This period was dominated by great events of national and international history, which inevitably were expressed in Urbino. The period of the fascist dictatorship left its mark on the city, especially from an architectural point of view, with a fascist elementary school [...] "Giovanni Pascoli" [...] (1932) built on the ancient Garden of Saint Lucia (part of the duke’s private gardens), the restoration of the palace-Mauruzi Gherardi, then the seat of the court, as well as the Student House, to compensate for the shortage of accommodation as a result of the large increase in university population and housing for the maimed and <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsing the categorisations {{which have}} helped to build the field of {{disability}} in France, this article analyses the meanings of disability and how they shifted over the 20 th century. Our aim is to identify, from a holistic perspective, both {{the conditions under which}} they were produced and the major paradigms in which they were rooted. The initial category thus originates in the moral division of poverty which was part of mediaeval Christianity and which, in the 14 th century, put forward inaptitude for work as a legitimate reason for assistance. At the end of the 19 th century and the start of the 20 th century, solidarism and the principle of social debt opened the way for redress for the damage caused by society: financial redress to begin with, then redress in the sense of “rehabilitation” {{within the context of a}} war economy. Breaking down the boundaries of inaptitude, these new procedures made a distinction between people disabled through war or accidents at work – which came under the heading of collective responsibility – and <b>disabled</b> <b>civilians.</b> Within their groups, the latter therefore produced and distributed a new meaning: disability “as an épreuve of the self”, a category of experience which was to find support from various vulgates of human and social sciences. However, the result was different acceptances of the meaning of épreuve; although these had in common the fact that they focused attention on the person, they were accompanied by distinct modalities for the social treatment of disability. The vicissitudes of meanings of disability “as an épreuve” illustrate the movement of reflexivity and subjectivity which drive our late modernity and its effects on current social policies and practices...|$|R
50|$|According to all madhhabs, {{it is not}} {{permissible}} to kill {{women or}} children unless they are fighting against the Muslims. The Hanafi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools forbid killing {{of those who are}} not able to fight, including monks, farmers, and serfs, as well as mentally and physically <b>disabled.</b> Harming <b>civilian</b> areas and pillaging residential areas is also forbidden, as is the destruction of trees, crops, livestock and farmlands. The Muslim forces may not loot travelers, as doing so is contrary to the spirit of jihad. Nor do {{they have the right to}} use the local facilities of the native people without their consent. If such a consent is obtained, the Muslim army is still under the obligation to compensate the people financially for the use of such facilities. However, Islamic law allows the confiscation of military equipment and supplies captured from the camps and military headquarters of the combatant armies.|$|R
5000|$|At the Eighth International Conference of Red Cross Societies in London in 1907, the {{assembled}} delegates {{decided to create}} a commemorative International Nightingale Medal to be awarded to those distinguished in the nursing field. Subsequently, the Florence Nightingale Medal was instituted in 1912 by the International Committee of the Red Cross. It is the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve and is awarded to nurses or nursing aides for [...] "exceptional courage and devotion to the wounded, sick or <b>disabled</b> or to <b>civilian</b> victims of a conflict or disaster" [...] or [...] "exemplary services or a creative and pioneering spirit {{in the areas of}} public health or nursing education".|$|R
50|$|Narrowboats and barges {{came from}} all over the UK, many {{travelling}} for weeks along hundreds of miles of inland waterways and through many locks {{to take part in the}} parade. They included President representing the Lord-Lieutenant of Staffordshire, Beatty from Merseyside, Hazelnut from Byfleet, Centenary from Warwickshire, Lord Toulouse from Worcestershire, Marie Celeste from Lancashire, Oh Be Joyful from Cheshire, the Mounbatten Crusader from Northamptonshire, and the Shropshire Lad and Shropshire Lass which include in their crews <b>disabled</b> servicemen and <b>civilians.</b> A number of Dutch barges, used as houseboats on rivers in the UK also took part. They were followed by launches, cruisers and passenger vessels of various kinds, containing many spectators.|$|R
50|$|Over {{sixty years}} ago, Dr. Henry H. Kessler founded the Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation; a {{hospital}} dedicated {{to improving the}} quality of life for people with physical disabilities. Following World War II, the institute served <b>disabled</b> veterans and <b>civilians.</b> In 1951, it received a grant from the State of New Jersey toward a pre-vocational diagnostic unit. The vocational education program for people with physical limitations matched interest and abilities with previous work experience and assisted patients in job placements. Responding to an increased demand for services, in 1961 the Institute expanded from 16 beds to 48 beds. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the institution continued to expand both in terms of patient capacity as well as outpatient facilities.|$|R
5000|$|In 1912, the International Committee of the Red Cross instituted the Florence Nightingale Medal, {{which is}} awarded {{every two years}} to nurses or nursing aides for {{outstanding}} service. It is the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve and is awarded to nurses or nursing aides for [...] "exceptional courage and devotion to the wounded, sick or <b>disabled</b> or to <b>civilian</b> victims of a conflict or disaster" [...] or [...] "exemplary services or a creative and pioneering spirit {{in the areas of}} public health or nursing education". Since 1965, International Nurses Day has been celebrated on her birthday (12 May) each year. The President of India honours nursing professionals with the [...] "National Florence Nightingale Award" [...] every year on International Nurses Day. The award, established in 1973, is given in recognition of meritorious services of nursing professionals characterised by devotion, sincerity, dedication and compassion.|$|R
40|$|In {{our world}} today, afflicted by wars between States, by {{conflict}} between groups within States, {{and by the}} scourge of terrorism, civilians constitute the ‘vast majority of casualties in situations of armed conflict’ (UN Security Council, Resolution 1894, 2009). Civilian victims of documented and un-documented armed conflicts and their destructive consequences run in the millions. An {{overwhelming majority of the}} dead, injured, <b>disabled</b> are <b>civilians</b> and damages caused by armed conflicts primarily affect the civilian infrastructure and the basic resources of subsistence of entire populations. Civilians today are {{in the line of fire}} not only as a side effect of war. Increasingly, they are becoming the prime and intentional targets of combatants and armed elements. ‘Political and military designs supersede basic respect for the dignity and rights of persons and communities’ (Migliore 2009) and civilians are becoming deliberate targets and means for achieving political or military gains. They are even being used as a human shield for armed advancement. The menace of civilian deaths in the line of fire is of utmost concern for all humanity, for all religions, and for Christianity. Among the foundational teachings on which the Catholic perspective to this important issue of placing civilians in the line of fire is based, we can identify three core beliefs: a) all human beings are equal in dignity and their life is sacred; b) the right and duty to defend the life and common good from unjust aggressors; c) the permanent validity of the moral law forbidding murder even in the context of armed conflicts. After considering these the paper studies some of the ways in which the Catholic Church responds to the situation of civilians caught in the line of fire...|$|R
5000|$|The opening {{shots of}} the Persian Gulf War were fired on January 17 in pursuit of defense-suppression: at 2:20AM local time Task Force Normandy, a group of twelve American helicopters, {{infiltrated}} into Iraq {{with the goal of}} destroying two early-warning radar sites. Three MH-53J Pave Lows guided nine AH-64 Apaches to the targets, which the gunships destroyed, opening a hole in the Iraqi IADS for the initial wave of aircraft to exploit. Two F-117As knocked out the Nukhayb IOC, further widening the gap, although their next attack against the H-3 SOC was unsuccessful. Among the first targets hit by F-117As attacking into Baghdad, bombs damaged the Al Taqaddum IOC and Talil SOC, shortly followed by Tomahawk strikes that disabled the electrical grid upon which Kari depended; reportedly some used special warheads filled with carbon fiber bundles to short-circuit the network. For the next several hours dozens of Coalition aircraft poured into Iraq. Those which weren't specifically directed to suppress air defenses had significant SEAD escort, including the use of BQM-74 drones and ADM-141 TALD decoys which would both [...] "take the hit" [...] for the manned airplanes and cause the Iraqis to reveal their position when they tracked or fired upon the lure. The first night's largest sortie was a joint US Air Force-Navy SEAD mission consisting of fifty aircraft designed to look like a bombing raid on Baghdad but which instead were fitted out with decoys, drones and HARMs to destroy air defenses protecting the city. With Kari degraded due to the <b>disabling</b> of the <b>civilian</b> electrical grid the Iraqi SAMs were forced to use their organic radar, producing what one pilot called [...] "HARM Heaven". A total of 67 HARMs were fired over the course of twenty minutes, causing a significant reduction in Iraqi air defenses around the capital based on follow-up missions.|$|R
