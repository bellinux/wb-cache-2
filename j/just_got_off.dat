6000|$|To {{return to}} his letter. In {{the course of the}} day's work he casually and briefly {{mentioned}} a particular job he had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> his hands. His absence in England had been the cause of delay. The job had been to make a punitive expedition to a neighbouring island, and, incidentally, to recover the heads of some mutual friends of ours--a white-trader, his white wife and children, and his white clerk. The expedition was successful, and Mr. Woodford concluded his account of the episode with a statement to the effect: [...] "What especially struck me was the absence of pain and terror in their faces, which seemed to express, rather, serenity and repose"--this, mind you, of men and women of his own race whom he knew well and who had sat at dinner with him in his own house.|$|E

She had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> her mare to look at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she had been riding, and so her colours were up and her breath rather quick, so that her bosom plimmed and fell--plimmed and fell--every time plain to my eye. Ay, and there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying, 'Ware o' the pommy, ma'am: 'twill spoil yer gown.' 'Never mind me,' says she. Then Gabe brought her some of the new cider, and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not in a nateral way at all. 'Liddy,' says she, 'bring indoors a few gallons, and I'll make some cider-wine.' Sergeant, I was no more to her than a morsel of scroff in the fuel-house!" ...|$|E

[...] "They chased him round the grounds and we <b>just</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off</b> in a motor-car, but not before he'd been hit twice. He was just able to tell me a little.

60|$|For {{three nights}} they had what Mr. Hutchins {{described}} as love-feasts, and the mate as blamed bear-gardens. The crew were not particularly partial to hymns, considered as such, but hymns shouted {{out with the}} full force of their lungs while sharing the skipper's hymn book appealed to them strongly. Besides, it maddened the mate, and to know that they were defying their superior, {{and at the same time}} doing good to their own souls, was very sweet. The boy, whose voice was <b>just</b> breaking, <b>got</b> <b>off</b> some surprising effects, and seemed to compass about five octaves without distress.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{excuse me}} if I go back rather far. It was in '74, when I had been ill with Cuban fever. To keep me alive {{they had put}} me on board a ship at Santiago, {{and at the end}} of the voyage I found myself in London. I had very little money; I knew nobody. I tell you, sir, there are times when it's hard for a {{fighting}} man to get anything to do. People would say to me: 'Afraid we've nothing for a man like you in our business.' I tried people of all sorts; but it was true--I had been fighting here and there since '60, I wasn't fit for anything--" [...] He shook his head. [...] "In the South, before the war, they had a saying, I remember, about a dog and a soldier having the same value. But all this has nothing to do with what I have to tell you." [...] He sighed again and went on, moistening his lips: [...] "I was walking along the Strand one day, very disheartened, when I heard my name called. It's a queer thing, that, in a strange street. By the way," [...] he put in with dry ceremony, [...] "you don't know my name, I think: it is Brune--Roger Brune. At first I did not recognise the person who called me. He had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> an omnibus--a square-shouldered man with heavy moustaches, and round spectacles. But when he shook my hand I knew him at once. He was a man called Dalton, who was taken prisoner at Gettysburg; one of you Englishmen who came to fight with us--a major in the regiment where I was captain. We were comrades during two campaigns. If I had been his brother he couldn't have seemed more pleased to see me. He took me into a bar for the sake of old times. The drink went to my head, and by the time we reached Trafalgar Square I was quite unable to walk. He made me sit down on a bench. I was in fact--drunk. It's disgraceful to be drunk, but there was some excuse. Now I tell you, sir" [...] (all through his story he was always making use of that expression, it seemed to infuse fresh spirit into him, to help his memory in obscure places, to give him the mastery of his emotions; it was like the piece of paper a nervous man holds in his hand to help him through a speech), [...] "there never was a man with a finer soul than my friend Dalton. He was not clever, though he had read much; and sometimes perhaps he was too fond of talking. But he was a gentleman; he listened to me as if I had been a child; he was not ashamed of me--and it takes a gentleman not to be ashamed of a drunken man in the streets of London; God knows what things I said to him while we were sitting there! He took me to his home and put me to bed himself; for I was down again with fever." [...] He stopped, turned slightly from me, and put his hand up to his brow. [...] "Well, then it was, sir, that I first saw her. I am not a poet and I cannot tell you what she seemed to me. I was delirious, but I always knew when she was there. I had dreams of sunshine and cornfields, of dancing waves at sea, young trees--never the same dreams, never anything for long together; and when I had my senses I was afraid to say so for fear she would go away. She'd be in the corner of the room, with her hair hanging about her neck, a bright gold colour; she never worked and never read, but sat and talked to herself in a whisper, or looked at me for a long time together out of her blue eyes, a little frown between them, and her upper lip closed firm on her lower lip, where she had an uneven tooth. When her father came, she'd jump up and hang on to his neck until he groaned, then run away, but presently come stealing back on tiptoe. I used to listen for her footsteps on the stairs, then the knock, the door flung back or opened quietly--you never could tell which; and her voice, with a little lisp, 'Are you better today, Mr. Brune? What funny things you say when you're delirious! Father says you've been in heaps of battles!"' ...|$|E

At half time, Prescott was offered a pain killing enjection but refused, telling team manager Tom Mitchell [...] "I <b>just</b> can’t <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> Tom. We would be two men short.

But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer Steve Peregrin Took and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: [...] "He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in Melody Maker to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, {{the day of the}} gig.

50|$|On 8 May 2014, Wagstaff re-signed {{with the}} Wildcats on a two-year deal (with {{the option of}} a third). On 24 October 2014, Wagstaff was {{involved}} in an ugly on-court incident with Sydney Kings forward Josh Childress. With the Wildcats holding a hefty lead late in the third term of their 84-63 win, Childress hit the floor after running into an off-ball screen from Wagstaff under the Wildcats basket. After getting to his feet, Childress responded by running into Wagstaff with a raised forearm <b>just</b> as Wagstaff <b>got</b> <b>off</b> a shot. The vision of the incident was seen around the world, as Childress was handed a one-game suspension and a fine for unduly rough play and bringing the game into disrepute. The 2014-15 season {{turned out to be}} a near carbon copy of the 2010-11 season for the Wildcats as they finished fourth on the ladder and were knocked out in the semi-finals, failing to defend their 2013-14 title in a season that was plagued with injuries. Wagstaff's points production dropped to a near career-low in 2014-15 as he averaged just 8.5 per game; he still managed to average a career-high 4.0 rebounds per game.|$|R

Maybe he was pressured, tortured. I don't think it's the boy's own fault. No doubt at the time—I never seen him or never met him—no doubt he was young and he wasn't trained properly.|$|E

5000|$|There was an {{extraordinary}} amount of tension at the start of that tour ... It <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to a negative start. It was definitely much darker than any Led Zeppelin tour ever before that time ... The kind of people they had around them had deepened into some really criminal types. I think Richard Cole and perhaps some of the band and everybody around the band was so far into drugs at that point, that the drugs turned on them. They still had their moments of greatness (but) some of the shows were grinding and not very inspired ... The Bindon brothers were the thugs that were friends of Peter Grant's and were on this whole tour as security guards. And they kind of brought an element of darkness into this thing.|$|E

Chamberlain left the band following this tour and the filming of the [...] "Alive" [...] video on August 3, 1991 in Seattle, Washington at RKCNDY to join the Saturday Night Live band. For his replacement, Chamberlain suggested drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the Ten album. Chamberlain said, [...] "I toured in the van with them, played a bunch of clubs—I had a good time, definitely had a good time.

Lily is stunned that Emma would track her down based on the {{birthmark}} on her wrist as proof, even as Emma tries to explain that there's a higher force at power here that has kept them in each other's lives and forced Lily's many bad decisions. Lily then tells Emma {{that she does not}} believe her and refuses her offer to help. She also tells Emma that she is married and has a daughter, only to walk over to the young girl who <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> a school bus and asks her to pretend to be her daughter in exchange for a free week of burgers. This leads Emma to be suspicious of Lily and follow her to her home, where they find a wall filled with newspaper clippings and clues about Storybrooke; it turns out that Lily knows everything about its existence, and is plotting revenge on the people responsible. The two then hear a car burning rubber (Emma's VW) and leaving the place. They believe Lily is ready to carry out her plot as the Snow Queen's scroll is inside, so Emma finds a monkey wrench, then smashes the window of another vehicle and the ladies race off after Lily until they catch up with her and corner her. When Lily threatens Emma by vowing to kill Mary Margaret and David, she and Emma start fighting (eventually causing an electrical strike that takes out the headlights on Emma's car) until Emma ultimately starts pointing a gun at Lily, who dares her to shoot, since all she ever does is ruin things anyway and adds that decisions are inherently part of her. Realizing that killing Lily would become a major line that would draw Emma into darkness, Regina tells her to lower the gun and Emma does just that.|$|E
