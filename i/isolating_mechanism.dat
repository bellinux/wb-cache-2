50|$|Reproductive {{isolation}} acts as {{the primary}} mechanism driving genetic divergence in allopatry and can be amplified by divergent selection. Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation are often the most cited mechanisms for allopatric speciation, and as such, {{it is difficult to}} determine which form evolved first in an allopatric speciation event. Pre-zygotic simply implies the presence of a barrier prior to any act of fertilization (e.g. an environmental barrier dividing two populations) while post-zygotic implies the prevention of successful inter-population crossing after fertilization (e.g. the production of an infertile hybrid). Since species pairs who diverged in allopatry often exhibit pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms, investigation of the earliest stages in the life cycle of the species can indicate whether or not divergence occurred due to a pre-zygotic or post-zygotic factor. However, establishing the specific mechanism may not be accurate, as a species pair continually diverges over time. For example, if a plant experiences a chromosome duplication event, reproduction will occur, but sterile hybrids will result—functioning as a form of post-zygotic isolation. Subsequently, the newly formed species pair may experience pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction as selection, acting on each species independently, will ultimately lead to genetic changes making hybrids impossible. From the researchers perspective, the current <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanism</b> may not reflect the past <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

Two or three species of Jaera albifrons occur frequently on the same strand, partially isolated (approximately 50 %) by ecological preferences. In zones of species overlap, hybrids remain scarce (0. 6 % average); sexual isolation is due to homogamic tenden-cies of male sexual choice, to specific male displays and especially to female reactivity.

40|$|Abstract: Speciation {{involves}} {{the formation of}} reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as a difference in pollinators, incompatibility between pollen tubes and stylar tissue, hybrid seed abortion, or poor growth of hybrid seedlings. We studied reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in naturally sympatric populations of Penstemon spectabilis Thurber and Penstemon centranthifolius (Benth.) Benth. where F 1 hybrids occurred at very low frequency. We compared conspecific crosses, backcrosses, and heterospecific crosses in terms of pollen grain germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, seed set, and offspring performance. We found several postpollination barriers to hybridization. When P. spectabilis was the ovule parent, the lack of natural hybridization was partially explained {{by the presence of}} two isolating factors: reduced pollen tube growth and reduced seed set. When P. centranthifolius was the recipient, the barrier to hybridization was nearly 100 % effective and occurred primarily at the stages of pollen grain germination and fruit set. The success of backcrossing was generally intermediate between conspecific and heterospecific crossing. For these two species, it is likely that partial pollinator specificity in addition to strong postpollination reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> contribute to maintaining the species boundary. Key words: speciation, hybridization, introgression, Penstemon, reproductive isolating barriers.

40|$|ReviewInternational audienceA {{large number}} of {{mathematical}} models have been developed that show how natural and sexual selection can cause prezygotic isolation to evolve. This article attempts to unify this literature by identifying five major elements that determine the outcome of speciation caused by selection: a form of disruptive selection, a form of <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanism</b> (assortment or a mating preference), a way to transmit the force of disruptive selection to the <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanism</b> (direct selection or indirect selection), a genetic basis for increased isolation (a one- or two-allele mechanism), and an initial condition (high or low initial divergence). We show that the geographical context of speciation (allopatry vs. sympatry) {{can be viewed as}} a form of assortative mating. These five elements appear to operate largely independently of each other and can be used to make generalizations about when speciation is most likely to happen.

We illustrate our arguments using a longitudinal case study of the evolving relationship between Apple and the Foxconn Technology Group. Practical implications For supplier firms, the message is to upgrade, develop distinctive resources and capabilities, and diversify the customer base. Otherwise, suppliers will forever be condemned to low operating margins and the threat of being replaced by cheaper, more agile rivals. For focal firms, the message is not to rest on your laurels. The potency of <b>isolating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may well dissipate, suppliers will no doubt strive to lessen their positions of dependence and competitors will inevitably emerge, with the result that once-profitable outsourcing arrangements may quickly erode.
