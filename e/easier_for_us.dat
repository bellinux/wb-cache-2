25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|But after {{enrolling in}} public school and moving to Montana — a {{predominantly}} white state, albeit one with a decidedly hippie-ish vibe — Lamb and Lynx decided they simply no longer believed what they’d been taught. ..."I’m glad {{we were in the}} band," [...] Lynx said, [...] "but I think we should have been pushed toward something a little more mainstream and <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to handle than being front-men for a belief system that we didn’t even completely understand at that time. We were little kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2010, it was {{reported}} that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the al-Qaeda magazine [...] Inspire, Al-Awlaki wrote, [...] "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," [...] and was quoted as saying, The large number of participants makes it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ... But even then our campaign should not be limited to only those who are active participants.|$|E
2500|$|On March 25, 2014, Chabot {{introduced}} the Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act (H.R. 4292; 113th Congress) into the House. According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill [...] "narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) {{to make it}} <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries." [...] However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were [...] "taken in violation of international law by Nazi Germany between January 30, 1933 and May 8, 1945." ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming for {{the series}} takes place in New York City, {{significantly}} in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as [...] "the {{only place in the}} city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Sound stage work also takes place in New York. Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography {{for the series}}, after doing the same for Jessica Jones.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Harlem, {{including}} Lenox Avenue and areas where American Gangster was shot, the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, Riverside Park, and the Riverside Drive viaduct; in Washington Heights, including at the United Palace; Cortlandt Alley in Chinatown; in areas of Queens for when Cage escapes Seagate Prison and puts on the classic Power Man costume; the Roosevelt Island steam plant and Queens Detention Facility for interiors of Seagate; the Music Hall of Williamsburg for the exterior of Harlem's Paradise; the former Fulton Correctional Facility in The Bronx for the Crispus Attucks Complex; and the Long Island City portion of Newtown Creek. It was important to Coker for the series to film in Harlem, [...] "the {{only place in the}} city where you see those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Soundstage filming for the series took place at Broadway Stages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For the church that Cage and Temple visit in Savannah, Georgia, an abandoned church in The Bronx was found that was being sold, and the production was able to [...] "graffiti up and sort of ruin" [...] it. They also had to spend two days carting snow from the site before filming, after a recent blizzard.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{endeavour}} to be glad, sir," [...] answered Mildred, {{smiling in}} so suffering a manner, as to awaken all her companion's sympathies; [...] "but {{it is not}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to rejoice at any thing which is gained {{by the loss of}} our former valued friend." ...|$|R
60|$|LAVINIA. Captain: your jokes are too grim. Do {{not think}} it is <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to die.

Death is harder <b>for</b> <b>us</b> than <b>for</b> you: the martyr's agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious.|$|R

5000|$|Nowadays, {{our view}} of slavery is {{completely}} different. It is <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to the two hundred years' distance see hollowness of the old arguments in its defense.

6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I shall {{not give up}} Thorbury yet. It is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to work for Miss Drane here than {{anywhere}} else, because we are here, {{and we are not}} anywhere else. Moreover, she will like to come here, for then she will not be among strangers; so please let us exhaust Thorbury before thinking of any other place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your father's note {{suggests}} to me," [...] replied Nugent, [...] "that he {{is a little}} hurt at the short notice I gave him of our discussion here. I thought--if you and Madame Pratolungo went on first--that you might make our peace with the rector, and assure him that we meant no disrespect, before Oscar and I appeared.

6000|$|... "Now we {{will just}} buckle to, lad," [...] Stephen Boldero said. [...] "This bey is {{the captain of}} the corsair, and he can make things a deal <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> if he chooses; so we will not spare ourselves.

6000|$|... "It is <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to criticise the man," [...] remarked Beth, [...] "and {{he may be}} sorry, now, {{that he did not}} act differently.

5000|$|... "We ran our plays {{from the}} T formation...

6000|$|... 'At any rate, Ned, that affair {{last night}} {{has made it}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to get the men {{together}} for the other job.

60|$|We talked on, and, as {{sometimes}} happens, we convinced {{each other}} so thoroughly that she came to my ground and I went to hers.
