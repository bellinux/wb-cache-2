This is accepted almost as an article of faith; there is almost never any questioning or disputing of <b>its</b> <b>inevitability.</b> I have no intention of questioning or disputing <b>its</b> <b>inevitability</b> in this paper; but there are questions regarding the computerizing of library catalogs which ought to, and indeed do, trouble conscientious library managers. These are the crucial questions of how to computerize and when to computerize. The work I will report on was prompted mainly by concern with these questions. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

60|$|To present Cesare Borgia thus {{in a plain}} {{straightforward}} tale at {{this time}} of day, would be to provoke the scorn and derision of those who have made his acquaintance in the pages of that eminent German scholar, Ferdinand Gregorovius, and of some other writers not quite so eminent yet eminent enough to serve serious consideration. Hence has it been necessary to examine at close quarters the findings of these great ones, and to present certain criticisms of those same findings. The author is overwhelmingly conscious of the invidious quality of that task; but he is no less conscious of <b>its</b> <b>inevitability</b> if this tale is to be told at all.|$|R

Through examining how both the work of Bloody Betty {{and the manner in which}} that work is preserved maintain mutually exclusive contradictions, this project offers performance scholars a feminist theoretical framework for approaching similarly volatile contradictions in Fourth Wave feminist aesthetics and the online archive. This project proposes that both those objects of study require a feminist reconsideration of the gaze (live and online) that does not neutralize the volatility of sexual objectification, but rather accepts <b>its</b> <b>inevitability</b> in service of more effective feminist praxis...|$|R

He proposed to relinquish Russia's commercial and industrial enterprises in Korea to obtain an agreement with Japan, in order to safeguard her interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and avoid complications with Great Britain. However, he was steadily sidelined by the jingoist hard-liners from the military, especially after the appointment of Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev as Viceroy of the Far East and events continued their downward spiral towards war, with Lamsdorf seemingly resigned to <b>its</b> <b>inevitability.</b>|$|R

In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened.

Thurm felt there were great character moments in the episode and that the double length helped the audience bond with Bismuth. Furthermore, Thurm felt that the episode was [...] "the opening of a floodgate" [...] into the experiences of the Gem War. Vrai Kaiser of The Mary Sue made particular emphasis on the episode's portrayal of the ethical turmoil of war and <b>its</b> <b>inevitability</b> as [...] "a means of Steven finally having to draw a line in what he believes that isn't a categorical win".|$|R

The weak expressibility of the classical propositional language enriched with the non-normal modal operators of essence and accident is highlighted and illustrated, both with respect to the definability of the more usual modal operators as well as with respect to the characterizability of classes of frames. Several interesting problems and directions are left open for exploration...|$|R
