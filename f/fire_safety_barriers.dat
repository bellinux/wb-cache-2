Recent fire accidents involving CNG buses {{have shown that}} tanks may explode though compliant with current ECE UN R 110 regulation.

40|$|In recent years, the {{external}} thermal insulation composite system (ETICS) {{has been applied}} increasingly {{in a lot of}} buildings for energy conservation purposes. However, the increased use of different combustible insulation materials in the ETICS has raised serious <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> problems. <b>Fires</b> involving this type of ETICS have caused severe damage and loss. Often, the fire spread depends on the thermal material of ETICS. Products of polymeric foams or inorganic fibrous material are commonly used. Practice and case studies of researchers show that involved expanded polystyrene is the most dangerous case of the fire spread. Therefore, it is important to choose the right material. In order to limit fire spread and improve <b>fire</b> <b>safety,</b> <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> from were suggested being installed. These measures may include the installation of a noncombustible lintel above each opening in the façade (windows, doors) to prevent flames penetrating the insulating material. Additionally, firestop barriers can be installed horizontally over the entire façade. The fire barriers have to be made of non-combustible materials, such as mineral wool, and are required on every alternate floor in buildings. Energy renovation is a great chance to increase <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> in buildings. Therefore, the requirements of additional <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> and prevention are different in Europe. Currently, there are not much data available on the behaviour of different insulation materials (expanded polystyrene and mineral wool) in ETICS and their relevant characteristics during operating life and ETICS durability time. This paper cites the requirements of additional fire prevention in different European countries. Analysis of the physical properties (vapour resistance, thermal transmittance, water absorption and etc.) of the expanded polystyrene and mineral wool products of is presented.

However, the increase use of combustible insulation materials in the ETIS has raised serious <b>fire</b> <b>safety</b> problems. <b>Fires</b> involving this type of ETIS have caused severe damage and loss. In order to improve its <b>fire</b> <b>safety,</b> <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> were suggested to be installed. This paper introduces fire experiments that have been done to study the effects of fire barriers on preventing vertical fire spread along the ETIS. The experiments were performed according to BS 8414 - 1 : 2002 “Fire performance of external cladding systems – Part 1 : Test method for non-loadbearing external cladding systems applied to the face of the building”. The test facility consists of a 9 [*]m high wall. The fire sources were wood cribs with a fire size of 3 ± 0. 5 [*]MW. The insulation materials were expanded polystyrene foam (EPS). The fire barrier was a horizontal strip of rockwool with a width of 300 [*]mm. Thermocouples were used to measure temperatures outside and inside the ETIS. A series of experiments with different fire scenarios were done: no fire barrier, two fire barriers and three fire barriers at different heights. Test results were compared. The results show that the ETIS using EPS without fire barriers almost burned out, while the ETIS with fire barriers performed well in preventing fire spread. The temperatures above the fire barrier were much lower than those below the fire barrier, and most of the insulation materials above the top fire barrier stayed in place...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this master thesis is to discuss performance of dynamic <b>safety</b> <b>barriers.</b> A comprehensive literature review is performed {{in order to get}} understanding what dynamic <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> is.
