40|$|In paper a {{fragment}} of mammal tooth from Oligocene beds of Senovo colliery is discussed. Available is the distal half of third left molar from maxilla of an anthracotherian of species Anthracotherium magnum Cuvier, 1822 that is kept in <b>geologic</b> <b>collection</b> of the elementary school at Senovo. In Slovenia anthracotherian teeth were found in beds {{of the same age}} at Zagorje, Trbovlje, Hrastnik and Laško. All anthracotherian remains in Slovenia were found in coal deposits...|$|E

50|$|Giussani & Vighi saw and {{described}} boron mineralization in 1964 in a pyrite mine, Brosso, in Italy. They noticed secondary minerals forming between szaibelyite and ludwigite {{at the point}} where they come into contact with each other inside magnetite skarns. Years later in 1972 a few members from the Gruppo Mineralogico Lombardo found the first sample of a new unknown mineral around the same location. Since then canavesite has been traded as nesquehonite and added to <b>geologic</b> <b>collections.</b> Canavestie is one of few known carboborates. The name canavesite originates from the district of Canavese where the pyrite mine is located.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout {{his career}} Blake taught {{whenever}} he could about his passion, geology. In 1885, {{he was offered}} and accepted {{the presidency of the}} newly created South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City. Unfortunately, the territorial legislature reduced the funds for his position, and he declined the move but did send books from his collection to start the school's library. [...] In 1891, the Arizona Territory funded a new university in Tucson and in October 1895 he joined the faculty. From 1895 to 1905 he was professor of geology and director of the School of Mines at the University of Arizona. His students began their careers just at the time of rapid expansion in exploiting Arizona's world class copper deposits. He also served as the territorial geologist and prepared detailed reports on mining for the governor's annual report to the Secretary of Interior, for publication in magazines like the Mining & Scientific Press of San Francisco and the Engineering & Mining Journal of New York City, and in the local press. With his retirement he continued in an active emeritus status at the university until his death; had become recognized and revered for his geologic work and <b>geologic</b> <b>collections,</b> which he donated to institutions across the country; and became a loved Arizona pioneer elected president of the Arizona Pioneers Historical Society (now Arizona Historical Society).|$|R

40|$|Estimates {{of annual}} {{ground-water}} contribution to streamflow in 38 drainage basins of Minnesota {{by use of}} standard streamflow hydrograph separation methods permit determination of relations between ground-water runoff and such basin characteristics as geologic environment, precipitation and temperature, and percentage of lake and wetland cover. Generalized conclusions derived from {{analysis of the data}} are that ground-water runoff is (1) least from glaciated basins that have surficial lake bed sediments or gray-drift ground moraine immediately underlain by relatively impermeable bedrock and (2) greatest from glaciated basins that have surficial depos its immediately underlain by permeable bedrock or that have thick surficial loess deposits immediately underlain by permeable bedrock. Ground-water runoff is much greater from glaciated basins having red drift than from basins having gray drift. The rate of ground-water increases as annual precipitation increases. Lakes and wetlands sustain and regulate streamflow during rainless periods; if they were absent sustained streamflow from northern parts of the state would be greatly reduced. Recharge to aquifers in the state is difficult to ascertain. Because many aquifers are deeply buried by glacial materials of varying characteristics, not all ground-water runoff can be diverted into cones of depression, for there is some lateral as well as vertical movement of water in surficial deposits. Data on ground-water runoff can be useful in estimating the rate of recharge to aquifers and in evaluating the potential yields of ground-water reservoirs. However, no simple re- 1 ation exists between ground-water runoff and ground-water recharge or the potential yields of aquifers. Studies of basin characteristics were handicapped {{because of a lack of}} detailed <b>geologic</b> information. <b>Collection</b> and study of data intended to describe the dimensions and water -yielding properties of unconsolidated deposits in the basins of the state are urgently needed to support hydrologic studies involving ground-water development and management decisions...|$|R
40|$|UNLV {{participated in}} the two-day 65 % Design Development project meeting and {{assisted}} in planning and design of the future WBR museum and field/research station. UNLV held several internal meetings to advance planning for IT and security at the ranch. UNLV (Cline) and BLM (McAboy) have begun {{a series of meetings}} regarding updating the current Task Order, requesting a two-year no-cost extension for the two Assistance Agreements, and to develop a concept plan for the future WBR operating agreement between BLM and UNLV. Weather station progress included adding a Pyrheliometer that measures solar radiation received to the station. Progress was made in making past weather information available via the website, and two technical papers on renewable energy were submitted for publication. UNLV has begun funding a UNLV photography project at the ranch that involves documenting historic land use in the Mojave Desert. Progress on the Multimedia Field Guides project that will develop and disseminate a modern geological and environmental field guide includes: 1) remote sensing and <b>geologic</b> data <b>collection</b> for the WBR area, 2) development of a preliminary geologic/surface-type map of the region, and 3) testing of technology at the field site. PLI educators (Allison Brody and Amy Page) will submit an application to the Clark County School District (CCSD) for a Professional Development workshop on Environmental Literacy in April 2011. The workshop, which {{will be held at the}} ranch, will be directed at sixth, seventh, and ninth grade teachers who teach earth science, life science and environmental science, and offer one professional development credit. A final business plan was received by UNLV from Dornbusch and Associates, and was disseminated to BLM and AECOM team leaders. UNLV and BLM will meet to discuss the plan in April 2011...|$|R
40|$|Tracer {{testing in}} the {{fractured}} volcanic aquifer near Yucca Mountain, and in the alluvial aquifer south of Yucca Mountain, Nevada has been conducted {{in the past to}} determine the flow and transport properties of groundwater in those geologic units. However, no tracer testing has been conducted across the alluvium/volcanic interface. This thesis documents the investigative process and subsequent analysis and interpretations used to identify a location suitable for installation of a tracer testing complex, near existing Nye County wells south of Yucca Mountain. The work involved evaluation of existing <b>geologic</b> data, <b>collection</b> of wellbore seismic data, and a detailed surface seismic reflection survey. Borehole seismic data yielded useful information on alluvial P-wave velocities. Seismic reflection data were collected over a line of 4. 5 -km length, with a 10 -m receiver and shot spacing. Reflection data were extensively processed to image the alluvium/volcanic interface. A location for installation of an alluvial/volcanic tracer testing complex was identified based on one of the reflectors imaged in the reflection survey; this site is located between existing Nye County monitoring wells, near an outcrop of Paintbrush Tuff. Noise in the reflection data (due to some combination of seismic source signal attenuation, poor receiver-to-ground coupling, and anthropogenic sources) were sources of error that affected the final processed data set. In addition, in some areas low impedance contrast between geologic units caused an absence of reflections in the data, complicating the processing and interpretation. Forward seismic modeling was conducted using Seismic Un*x; however, geometry considerations prevented direct comparison of the modeled and processed data sets. Recommendations for additional work to address uncertainties identified {{during the course of this}} thesis work include: drilling additional boreholes to collect borehole seismic and geologic data; reprocessing a subset of the current seismic reflection data in the area chosen for a tracer complex; processing the existing reflection data set with refraction processing software; and conducting additional seismic reflection testing with different survey geometry...|$|R
