5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. <b>Gastric</b> <b>lavage,</b> better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than <b>gastric</b> <b>lavage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine.

During his 80 years of life, he wrote about different issues and topics (cardiology, rheumatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and neurology). Kussmaul was a student and professional without limits in his observation capacity. He preached with his own example in pursuit of science: observation, hypothesis, experimentation and analysis...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) has re-emerged {{as a major}} {{worldwide}} {{public health}} hazard with increasing incidence among adults and children. Although cases among children represent {{a small percentage of}} all TB cases, they are a reservoir from which many adult cases will arise. Estimates indicate that 9 million people develop TB annually, out of which 1 million (11 percent) occur in children less than 15 years old. Childhood tuberculosis is on the increase worldwide because of persisting inability to conform the diagnosis, leading to a large number of children dying of undiagnosed tuberculosis. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis has depended on bacteriological examination of sputum. In most of the developing countries sputum smear microscopy has been used as it {{has been found to be}} cheap and relative efficient. As a result of the high TB burden, there is an urgent need for improved methods of laboratory diagnosis of TB. This is especially needed in children were diagnosis is more challenging as mycobacteria is being detected in fewer than 50 percent of the cases. Children cannot produce adequate sputum samples for examination. Their sputum samples, if produced, has a low bacterial yield and making detection of mycobacteria by using the smear microscopy difficult. Therefore, <b>gastric</b> <b>lavages</b> from children are being recommended as the best specimen for culture. In this study, <b>gastric</b> <b>lavages</b> from 408 children suspected of having tuberculosis were examined for the recovery of mycobacteria. Recovery was optimized by the use of the relatively new non-radiometric fully automated BACTEC MGIT 960. BACTEC MGIT 960 produced a positivity rate of 27. 2 percent against 17. 2 percent that of Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media, which is a conventional culture method used widely. The direct microscopy which is the cheapest traditional method used in diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) yielded a 5. 6 percent positive rate. The BACTEC MGIT 960 had also a very high isolate detection rate of 98. 2 percent compared to that of L-J media of 61. 9 percent, and only 20. 4 percent were detected with the direct microscopy. On time taken to detection or mean time to detection (TTD) of v isolates, the BACTEC MGIT 960 technique had a shorter mean time to detection, 12. 5 days as compared to 34. 3 days shown by the L-J media technique. The study showed that children normally get tuberculosis from adult members of the household. A positive TB case was found in the households of 55. 4 percent of the suspects. The study has found that 46. 4 percent of the children below the age of 4 years developed the disease, compared to 10. 5 percent the older children in the age group 10 to 14 years. The study found that tuberculosis in children is mainly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Out of the 113 isolates detected, 110 (97. 3 percent) were M. tuberculosis. The remaining 2. 7 percent were the non-tuberculous M. avium complex and M. kansasii. It was inconclusive whether the 2. 7 percent of other species were causing tuberculosis and this need to be studied furthe...|$|R
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or <b>gastric</b> <b>lavage.</b> However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions.

5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, <b>gastric</b> <b>lavage</b> or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of <b>gastric</b> <b>lavage</b> has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription(JAK/STAT) on the renal ischemia-reperfusion(I/R) injury in rats. Methods Thirty six SD rats were divided randomly into 3 groups(12 each) : control groups,I/R groups,and Ag 490 (inhibitor of JAK 2) treatment group. The renal I/R model was induced by clamping bilateral renal arteries for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 24 hours in rats in I/R and Ag 490 group,and the rats in control group received no such operation. The rats in Ag 490 group were <b>gastric</b> <b>lavaged</b> with 8 mg/kg Ag 490 for 1 hour before surgery,while the rats in I/R and control group were lavaged with equivalent volume of NS. Morphological observations were performed. The protein expressions of STAT 3 and Bcl- 2 were measured by immunohistochemistry. The apoptotic rate of renal tissue was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling(TUNEL) assay. Results Histological examination revealed that the renal tubules in control group arranged regularly with no edema. Significant pathological changes,including renal tubular epithelial cell swelling,vacuolar degeneration,tubular dilatation,cast and fallen necrosis cell,and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in I/R group. These changes were more seriously in Ag 490 group. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the levels of STAT 3,Bcl- 2 and apoptosis were increased in I/R group compared with that in control group. The levels of STAT 3,Bcl- 2 were significantly decreased and apoptosis was increase in Ag 490 group than that in I/R group(P < 0. 05). Conclusions STAT 3 and Bcl- 2 may be activated by I/R through JAK 2 pathway. Blocking of the activation of JAK 2 may inhibit STAT 3 and Bcl- 2,and increase cell apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|Heat stroke is a {{life-threatening}} disease characterized clinically by {{central nervous system}} dysfunction and severe hyperthermia (core temperature rises to higher than 40 ℃). The unchecked rise of body core temperature overwhelms intrinsic or extrinsic heat generation mechanism, thus overwhelms homoeostatic thermoregulation. Hyperthermia causes cellular and organ dysfunction with progressive exacerbation resulting in multi-organ failure and death. Rapid cooling to reduce core temperature {{as quickly as possible}} is the primary and most effective treatment, as {{it has been shown that}} the major determinant of outcome in heatstroke is the degree and duration of hyperthermia. If suppression of body temperature is delayed, the fatality rate will be elevated. Several cooling methods are available, including physical cooling by conduction, convection and evaporation with ice/cold water immersion, internal cooling by invasive methods such as hemofiltration, intravascular cooling, cold water <b>gastric</b> and rectal <b>lavage,</b> and cooling with drugs.

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} infections {{can result}} in significant morbidity and mortality in nonhuman primate colonies. Preventative health programs designed to detect infection routinely include tuberculin skin testing (TST). Because Mammalian Old Tuberculin used for TST contains antigens common {{to a variety of}} mycobacterial species, false-positive results can occur in animals sensitized to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Over 11 mo, a large colony of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) demonstrated a 3. 6 % prevalence of equivocal or positive TST reactions (termed ‘suspect reactions’). Culture of <b>gastric</b> aspirates, bronchoalveolar <b>lavage</b> fluid, and feces revealed a single animal with a positive fecal culture for Mycobacterium gordonae. PCR amplification of M. gordonae DNA in feces collected from animals with suspect TST reactions (demonstrating a 66. 7 % colonization rate) and colony controls (demonstrating a 14. 3 % colonization rate) revealed a significant association between suspect TST reactions and intestinal colonization. Gross and histopathologic evaluation revealed a multifocal lymphadenopathy and granulomatous lymphadenitis in 2 of 4 TST-positive marmosets examined. Counter to expectations, granulomatous lymphoid tissue was culture-positive for M. kansasii rather than M. gordonae. Detection of M. gordonae in the feces of TST-suspect animals likely represents an apathogenic intestinal colonization that may serve as an indicator of NTM exposure, whereas evidence of histopathologic disease is associated with the more pathogenic M. kansasii. Although a high index of suspicion for M. tuberculosis should always be maintained, colonization with NTM organisms represents a cause of suspect TST reactions in common marmosets...|$|R

Drug levels were measured by "high performance liquid chromatography". Results: Just prior to the first morning dose, amiodarone concentrations in plasma were 1. 0 - 2. 9 (2. 0 +/- 0. 6) micrograms/ml, in saliva 0. 02 - 0. 25 micrograms/ml; flecainide in plasma 80 - 560 (316 +/- 163) ng/ml, in saliva 630 - 3700 (1749 +/- 963) ng/ml. After the morning dose we found maximal flecainide plasma levels of 462 +/- 203 and saliva levels of 3218 +/- 2857 ng/ml. The highest flecainide concentrations in the saliva (13, 400 and 11, 300 ng/ml) were found in two patients 30 and 60 min after the morning dose.

40|$|The global {{increase}} of tuberculosis, the dangerously fast {{spread of the}} disease and the emergence of multi-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, make an early diagnosis of the disease imperative. To ensure this happens, there should be extremely rapid detection and growth of a M. tuberculosis in culture from clinical specimens obtained. The present study submitted examines whether storing of the relevant specimen with different pathogenic density (105, 103 and 101) at 4, 20 and 36 degrees Celsius for a period of 24, 48 or 72 hours affects the microscopic and cultural identification of M. tuberculosis. To find out, three specimens (bronchoalveolar <b>lavage,</b> <b>gastric</b> juices and buffered gastric juices) were mixed with 10 different M. tuberculosis isolates. All 2. 700 samples were decontaminated by the NALC method according to routine tuberculosis diagnostics, stained as per the Ziehl-Neelsen method, were microscopically examined, and inoculated to one liquid and two solid culture mediums. The media employed were liquid MGIT tube, Löwenstein-Jensen medium and Stonebrink medium. After storage of up to three days, mycobacteria could be grown from all the samples. Storage did lead to a significant slowing of growth. For MGIT tubes the growth could be established earlier than for solid culture media. However, the influences of different storage temperatures and periods on the growth of M. tuberculosis in culture showed no significant differences, which is why no recommendation could be derived for an optimum storage temperature of below 36 degrees Celsius. Microscopy results also failed to exhibit adverse effects of different storage conditions. Samples of BAL and gastric juices can therefore be kept up to three days in a given ambient temperature without adverse effects on a subsequent diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with gastric cancer is poor, even following curative resection, and is related primarily to the extent of disease at presentation. In locally advanced <b>gastric</b> tumors, peritoneal <b>lavage</b> cytology (PLC) is a relevant prognostic factor. The Authors present their results of peritoneal washing cytology, evaluating the prognostic value of this technique, and discussing the clinical impact. Patients and Methods: From July 2003 to May 2008, results of PLC in 64 patients with histologically proven primary gastric adenocarcinomas were analyzed. At laparotomy the abdomen was irrigated with 200 ml of normal saline, and >= 50 ml were aspirated and examined by means of cytology and immunocytopathology. Results: PLC was positive in 7 cases (11 %). Overall, 86 % of patients with a positive PLC had a pT 3 /pT 4 tumor and 100 % with a positive PLC had an N-positive tumor (p < 0. 001); 71 % of patients with a positive PLC had a grade G 3 /G 4 tumor (p = 0. 001). At a median follow-up of 32 months, the cumulative 5 -year survival was 28 %. The median survival of patients presenting positive PLC (19 months) was significantly lower than that of patients with negative peritoneal cytology (38 months) (p = 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis identified cytology as a significant predictor of outcome (p = 0. 018). Conclusions: Results in the present series demonstrated that patients with a positive peritoneal cytology had advanced disease and poor prognosis, thus indicating that patients with locally advanced gastric cancer should undergo staging laparoscopy and PLC examination in order to select those requiring more aggressive treatment. Future therapeutic strategies should include PLC examination in preoperative staging, in order to select patients for more aggressive treatment...|$|R
