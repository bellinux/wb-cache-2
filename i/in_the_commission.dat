5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission.</b> The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E

A small number of separate statutory offences have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary offences, in which case, usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.

From March 1792 he also held the position of Minister of War. During the War in the Defence of the Constitution in 1792 he went on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to Berlin to request assistance from the Prussian government. On 4 July 1792 a sudden depression made him resign his ministerial positions. A vocal opponent of the Targowica Confederation and likely an author of an anonymous anti-Targowica brochure, he was specifically requested by the Russian government to not {{be involved in the}} negotiations; he also refused to join the Targowica Confederation, even after Poniatowski's accession to it.|$|E

The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Wheeler {{moved into a}} top-floor flat near Gordon Square {{with his wife and}} child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester's Roman Balkerne Gate which was published in the Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the Journal of Roman Studies; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica's revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, and so began to seek out alternative employment.|$|E
