40|$|Dynamic {{response}} <b>of</b> a light <b>equipment</b> item {{attached to}} a non-linear and torsionally coupled main system is evaluated under bi-directional earthquake excitation. To account for the effect of translations and torsion, each story of the building is modelled as three degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), with two DOFs for translation in two orthogonal directions and third DOF for torsion. The responses (relative displacement between the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> and {{the floor of the}} primary system on which the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> is mounted and absolute acceleration <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> itself), are determined under random ground motion in two orthogonal directions, which is idealized as a stationary random process represented by a white noise excitation. The responses are obtained by time domain simulation procedure. The response behavior <b>of</b> the light <b>equipment</b> is examined under a set of parametric variations. These parameters include the uncoupled lateral frequency of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems,</b> the ratio <b>of</b> uncoupled lateral to rotational frequencies of the primary system, eccentricity ratios of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems</b> in X and Y directions, damping ratio of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems</b> and the mass ratio of the two systems. Results of the study indicate that under some parametric conditions the responses <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> are significantly affected by torsional coupling and non-linearity of the primary system. It is also observed that the responses <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> can be alleviated by increasing the damping ratio <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
