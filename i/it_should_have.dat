5|$|Andrew III of Hungary {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples {{to send his}} grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of Hungary, died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models.

Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been frozen long ago.|$|E
5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
