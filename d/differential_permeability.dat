40|$|Case depth {{measurements}} of surface hardened steel parts {{are important for}} quality control. The magnetic properties, including initial permeability, <b>differential</b> <b>permeability</b> and saturation magnetization {{of a series of}} induction-hardened and carburized steel rods were studied through measurements, with the aim of developing new methods to evaluate the case depth nondestructively. Four-point alternating current potential drop (ACPD) method also has the potential to evaluate different case depths. The potential drop was measured on a series of 12 ̆ 2 diameter induction-hardened and carburized steel rod samples using a co-linear probe with pins aligned parallel to the axis of the rod. For comparison with the above-mentioned electromagnetic measurements, hardness profiles were obtained by microhardness measurements. It seems that {{measurements of}} initial permeability on surface hardened rods do not give a clear indication of case depth. <b>Differential</b> <b>permeability</b> was plotted versus applied magnetic field H. It is interesting to see that, when H is around 18 Oe, the <b>differential</b> <b>permeability</b> increases more-or-less in the sequence of case depth d in induction hardened samples. <b>Differential</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements give a good indication of case depth in induction hardened rods, but not carburized rods. The saturation magnetization decreases as the case depth increases. It was shown that four-point ACPD is a promising technique for distinguishing between different depths of case hardening.

40|$|Recent work by Bertotti [IEEE Trans. Magn. MAG‐ 24, 621 (1988) ] {{and others}} {{has shown that}} it is {{possible}} to model the micromagnetic Barkhausen discontinuities at the coercive point using a two‐parameter stochastic model. However, the present formulation of the model is restricted to limited regions of the hysteresis curve over which dM/dH is approximately constant and whendH/dt is held at a constant rate. A natural extension of this model is to take the basic result, in which the level of Barkhausen activity in one time period is related to the activity in the previous time period, and increment it by a small amount which is dependent on the <b>differential</b> <b>permeability.</b> The extension of the model proposed here uses the theory of ferromagnetichysteresis to determine the <b>differential</b> <b>permeability</b> at any point of the hysteresis loop.

Variations in applied stress, composition, and geomrtry will, either alone or in combination with each other, cause the magnetization process to change. The primary way to monitor changes in the magnetization process is to run the material or component of interest through a hysteresis cycle and plot the magnetic response on the B,H (magnetic induction, magnetic field) plane. The result is a hysteresis loop, a typical example of which is given in Figure 1. 1. The figure also shows a number of parameters that are used to describe the hysteresis loop.
