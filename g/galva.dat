40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{boundary conditions}} {{of an effect}} of social presence on the Stroop task and its interpretation {{in terms of an}} attentional view (P. Huguet, M. P. <b>Galvaing,</b> J. M. Monteil, & F. Dumas, 1999). In this view, social presence leads to attentional focusing, enhancing participants’ ability to screen out the distracting features of Stroop stimuli. As predicted, Stroop interference was found to be reduced by social presence, but an alternative account in which social presence exerts an effect on task selection received more support...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a 'naive' confederate can reduce the Stroop interference shown by participants (Huguet, <b>Galvaing,</b> Monteil & Dumas, 1999). We present evidence that social facilitation in the Stroop task is caused by strategic inhibition of the distracter word. Huguet et al. 's (1999) social facilitation finding was replicated, and delta plot analyses revealed that participants in the mere presence condition were strongly inhibiting distracter information. This assertion {{is supported by the}} fact that no distracter inhibition, and indeed no social facilitation, was found when the RSI was decreased so that participants were less able to prepare for every trial...|$|R

40|$|Since Stroop (1935), {{semantic}} access {{has been}} seen as automatic but today this is questioned, following minor modifications of the Stroop task. Besner, Stolz and Boutilier (1997) showed that coloring a single letter differently from the others and asking the participant to name the color of this letter, significantly reduced the Stroop effect. Huguet, <b>Galvaing,</b> Monteil and Dumas (1999) showed that another person’s presence during the test significantly reduced the Stroop effect. Raz, Shapiro, Fan and Posner (2002) showed a reduction in Stroop effect when hypnotized participants were told what would appear on the screen was not a word. These reductions suggest that semantic access of a word needs attentional resources, and is not automatic.   This review summarizes recent results concerning reduction of the Stroop effect through the three manipulations mentioned above. The similarities and conflicts of these studies are illustrated. The conclusions suggest that these manipulations seem not to reduce or prevent automatic semantic activation, but rather reduce non-semantic task-relevant response competition. Using measures other than behavioral measures like Event-Related Potentials and a new definition of automaticity are proposed to understand better the different results cited...|$|R
