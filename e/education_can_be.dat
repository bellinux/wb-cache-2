25|$|While {{it is true}} {{that very}} little detail of Hephaestion’s {{childhood}} and <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander’s empire, second only to the king himself.|$|E
25|$|According {{to these}} data, in 2011, Portugal didn't present any {{overspending}} neither on {{the coverage of}} social risks (social protection and health) and the slightly high spending on <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> related to a lag between the average qualifications of Portuguese and their European counterparts, resulting in an eventual attempt to overcome that lag. There have been some remarkable progresses towards that objective, since the school dropout rate fell from 43.6% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2011, being this still the 3rd highest in the EU, where the average was 13.5% in the same year.|$|E
25|$|According to UNDP 2010 report, Pakistan ranked 120 in 146 {{countries}} {{in terms of}} Gender-related Development Index (GDI), {{and in terms of}} Gender Empowerment Measurement (GEM) ranking, it ranked 92 in 94 countries. Gender inequality in <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured in different ways. Gross and net enrollment rates and completion and drop-out rates are the ways to identify the gender inequality in education. Pakistan aims to achieve Millennium Development Goals and also aims to eliminate gender disparity at all levels of education by the year 2015. Elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education requires higher allocation of resources on women's education. Strong gender disparities exist in literacy and educational attainment between rural and urban areas of Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” {{provides an example of}} how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E

As recounted in the book Challenging Mathematics, in 1978 Giblin and Porteous began to organise a Challenge competition for first and second formers in secondary school. By 1989 they were drawing 3,500 participants each year. The competition was held over two weekends in the Spring Term. Students considered six questions in each round. Marking was arranged through the mathematics department of Liverpool University, and prizes were awarded at [...] "an evening of mathematical recreation". Broad participation was encouraged by making half the problems widely accessible. Solutions to the problems appear in their book.|$|E
2500|$|One {{strategy}} for combating phishing is to train people to recognize phishing attempts, and {{to deal with}} them. <b>Education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> effective, especially where training emphasises conceptual knowledge and provides direct feedback. One newer phishing tactic, which uses phishing emails targeted at a specific company, known as spear phishing, has been harnessed to train individuals at various locations, including United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. In a June 2004 experiment with spear phishing, 80% of 500 West Point cadets who were sent a fake email from a non-existent Col. Robert Melville at West Point were tricked into clicking on a link that would supposedly take them to a page where they would enter personal information. (The page informed them that they had been lured.) ...|$|E

The modern scientific worldview and the bulk of physics <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said to flow from the scientific revolution in Europe, starting with the work of Galileo and Kepler in the early 1600s. [...] Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation were formulated in the 17th century, Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism in the 19th century, and quantum mechanics in the early-to-mid 20th century.

2500|$|In {{the book}} Cruise of the Alert – [...] Four Years in Patagonian, Polynesian, and Mascarene Waters (1878–82), Dr R. W. Coppinger speaks {{of his visit}} to Levuka and meeting Celua. The author {{describes}} him as [...] "a fine-looking man, twenty-three years old ... He surprised us all by speaking exceedingly good English, and possessing an intimate knowledge {{of the ways and}} manners of civilized life ... There was no topic of general interest on which he did not possess a fair amount of knowledge. He wore his hair in the fashion of the country, i.e., in a mop frizzled out to an immense size, and in other respects he was got up as a native chief of distinction. He spoke favourably of British rule, although, as we were otherwise informed, he himself had recently acquired a practical experience of the unpleasant consequences attending the commission of an indictable offence, in having to undergo a sentence of three months' hard labour." [...] This book talks about Celua spending three years at University after returning to Sydney with his father in 1874 but no other reference to his tertiary <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found.|$|E

Loy's slender figure with her uplifted face and one arm extending skyward presented a [...] "vision of purity, grace, youthful vigor, and aspiration" [...] that was singled out in a Los Angeles Times story that included a photo of the [...] "Inspiration" [...] figure along with the model's name—the first time her name appeared in a newspaper. A few months later, Loy's [...] "Inspiration" [...] figure was temporarily removed from the sculpture group and transported aboard the battleship Nevada for a Memorial Day pageant in which [...] "Miss Myrna Williams" [...] participated.

60|$|Whilst this {{restraint}} {{of foreign}} and domestic education {{was part of an}} horrible and impious system of servitude, the members were well fitted to the body. To render men patient under a deprivation of all the rights of human nature, everything which could give them a knowledge or feeling of those rights was rationally forbidden. To render humanity fit to be insulted, it was fit that it should be degraded. But when we profess to restore men to the capacity for property, it is equally irrational and unjust to deny them the power of improving their minds as well as their fortunes. Indeed, I have ever thought the prohibition of the means of improving our rational nature to be the worst species of tyranny that the insolence and perverseness of mankind ever dared to exercise. This goes to all men, in all situations, to whom <b>education</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> denied.|$|E

The scratching of a name, particularly when performed with blunt penknife or pencil by a person of imperfect School Board <b>education,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trusted in a little while to be indistinguishable from the grayest hieroglyphic by the grandest Druid of old. But nobody could get a modern policeman into the same picture with a Druid. This really vital piece of vandalism was done by the educated, not the uneducated; it was done by the influence of the artists or antiquaries who wanted to preserve the antique beauty of Stonehenge.
