5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing {{into the hands of}} foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also {{the only place where}} Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E

5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (<b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
25|$|The private {{shareholders}} {{decided not}} to appeal against the judgment, {{because there were no}} legal grounds for doing so. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> – who had contributed around £50 each, on average, to the fighting fund to bring the action – the case had served its purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{widening}} {{gulf between}} the top two divisions of English football can largely be put down to the increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs – combined with parachute payments following relegation – has also made it easier <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to quickly win promotion {{back to the top}} flight.|$|E

25|$|As {{the miners}} work only {{six in the}} twenty-four hours in the mines, and as the barrenness of the soil affords little scope for {{agricultural}} pursuits, they have of course abundance of time for reading: and I believe they generally employ it to good purpose; <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> can converse upon historical, scientific, and theological points so as to astonish a stranger; and even on political questions, they express their opinions with great acuteness and accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The Turkish {{language}} {{is the second}} most spoken language in Germany, after the German language. It was brought to the country by Turkish immigrants who speak it as their first language. These immigrants mainly learned the German language through employment, mass media, and social settings, and it has now become the second language <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Nonetheless, most Turkish immigrants have passed down their mother tongue to their children and descendants. In general, German-born Turks become bilingual at an early age, learning Turkish at home and German in state schools; thereafter, a dialectal variety often remains in their repertoire of both languages.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Čolić's arrival, Ambasadori {{employed}} a strange setup: they were essentially a military cover band as all the musicians, except for bandleader Slobodan Vujović, were army recruits. Their repertoire centred around 1960s rhythm & blues (Chicago, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, etc.) along with obligatory Yugoslav hits {{of the day and}} years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the bandmembers thrown into the mix. Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since its army part was not available <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and those offers had to be declined.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of reports of crop circles {{have appeared in}} and spread since the late 1970s as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> circles started appearing all over the world. To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the UK, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, {{and the absence of}} fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.|$|E
25|$|Instead, several {{regional}} written {{varieties of}} Romansh began appearing during the 16th century. Gian Travers {{wrote the first}} surviving work in Romansh, the Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs, in the Putèr dialect. This epic poem, written in 1527, describes the first Musso war, in which Travers himself had taken part. Travers also translated numerous biblical plays into Romansh, though only the titles survive <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Another early writer, Giachem Bifrun, who also wrote in Putèr, penned the first printed book in Romansh, a catechism published in 1552. In 1560 he published a translation of the New Testament: L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ.|$|E

500|$|Malcolm Earl [...] "Mal" [...] Waldron (August 16, 1925 – December 2, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. He {{started playing}} professionally in New York in 1950, {{after graduating from}} university. In the {{following}} dozen years or so Waldron led his own bands and played for those led by Charles Mingus, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy, among others. During Waldron's period as house pianist for Prestige Records in the late 1950s, he appeared on dozens of albums and composed <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> including writing his most famous song, [...] "Soul Eyes", for Coltrane. Waldron was often an accompanist for vocalists, and was Billie Holiday's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959.|$|E
500|$|These {{aspects of}} the symphonic poem demanded players to have {{superior}} caliber, perfect intonation, keen ears {{and knowledge of the}} roles of their orchestra members. The complexity of the symphonic poems may have been one reason that Liszt urged other conductors to [...] "hold aloof" [...] from the works until they were prepared to deal with the challenges. Most orchestras of small towns at that time were not capable of meeting the demands of this music. Contemporary orchestras also faced another challenge when playing Liszt's symphonic poems for the first time. Liszt kept his works on manuscripts, distributing them to the orchestra on his tour. Some parts of the manuscripts were so heavily corrected that players found it difficult to decipher them, let alone play them well. The symphonic poems were considered such a financial risk that orchestral parts <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were not published until the 1880s.|$|E
500|$|Bruce {{returned}} {{briefly to}} Australia in 1914, swapping positions {{within the company}} with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but {{all three of them}} would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the Australian Imperial Force. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> long periods of residency in) Great Britain. Bruce enlisted and received a commission as lieutenant on 7 February 1915 [...] and was attached to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in Egypt, which was then assigned to the British 29th Division. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF). First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill had devised a strategy of capturing the Dardanelles from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However allied naval forces were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This {{was the beginning of the}} now infamous Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E

500|$|The {{front porch}} {{campaign}} that McKinley decided on {{was a natural}} extension of the pilgrimages to Canton by McKinley devotees that were already occurring. After a few initial stumbles, things settled into routine by mid-September. While any group could visit McKinley by writing in advance, his campaign arranged <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and they came from towns small and large. If possible, the group's leader was brought to Canton in advance to confer with McKinley on what each would say; if not, the group would be met at the Canton railroad station by a McKinley representative, who would discuss what would be said with the group's leader. There were parades every day in Canton that campaign season, as the groups marched through the bunting-draped streets, escorted by a mounted troop known as the McKinley Home Guards, who saw to it that groups arrived at the McKinley residence on a prearranged schedule. There, the group leader would deliver his remarks, and McKinley would deliver a reply often prepared in advance. [...] Afterwards, there might be refreshments or the opportunity to shake hands with McKinley, before the delegation was escorted off for their return journey to the railroad station. If it rained, the meetings took place in one of several indoor venues.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the band}} Green River {{released}} their debut EP Come on Down, which is cited {{by many as}} being the very first grunge record. Another seminal release {{in the development of}} grunge was the Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records in 1986. The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and The U-Men. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> it was their first appearance on record. The artists had [...] "a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, [...] "People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it?' [...] People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'" [...] Later that year Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation and Green River's Dry As a Bone EP as part of his new label, Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as [...] "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation". Sub Pop's Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, inspired by other regional music scenes in music history, worked to ensure that their label projected a [...] "Seattle sound", reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging. While music writer Michael Azerrad acknowledged that early grunge bands like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Tad had disparate sounds, he noted [...] "to the objective observer, there were some distinct similarities." ...|$|E
