40|$|Analytic {{expressions}} for {{the frequency}} dependent transfer functions and their time dependent inverse Fourier transforms, which represent the forward transmission and the multiple reflec-tion in a waveguide section are derived. Making {{use of these}} analytic expressions, the multi-ple reflection of a narrowband Gaussian pulse in a waveguide section with different load-side and generator-side terminations is graphically demonstrated. This shows that early reflections are in general less dispersed than later ones. For electrically long waveguide sections operat-ing high enough above their cutoff frequency, the different reflections are temporally distin-guishable. On the other hand, in both electrically short and <b>evanescent</b> <b>waveguide</b> sections, the temporal overlapping between the different reflections {{is so strong that}} their individual identification is not possible. It is also shown that recently reported superluminal propagation of pulse peaks can take place in electrically short <b>evanescent</b> <b>waveguide</b> sections only.

In this work, we experimentally studied Si 3 N 4 waveguides whose sub-wavelength cross-sections and high aspect ratios support fundamental and higher order modes {{at a single}} excitation wavelength. Due to differing modal effective indices, these co-propagating modes interfere and generate beating patterns with significant evanescent field intensity. Using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), we map the structure of these beating modes in three dimensions. Our results demonstrate the potential of NSOM to optimize waveguide design for complex field trapping devices. By reducing the in-plane width, the population of competing modes decreases, resulting in a simplified spectrum of beating modes, such that waveguides with a width of 650 nm support three modes with two observed beats.

40|$|Recently, Giovannetti et al. {{successfully}} {{demonstrated that}} some metals (such as Cu and Au) only have weak van der waals interaction with graphene {{and thus can}} only form weak bonding without severely shifting graphene’s band structure, which describes the energies range of the electrons in the material. Therefore, this opens up windows for graphene enhancement without greatly changing its properties. Furthermore, Zhou et al. later suggested the possibility of self-assembling periodic arrays of alkali atoms on graphene. In our group, graphene thin films fabricated in a cost effective way using solution-processed methods have been used extensively, including decorating graphene thin films with metallic nanoparticles for optical enhancement. Motivated by these experiments, our study reports a facile fabrication method for copper nanoparticle (Cu-np) superlattice, which is a periodic structure of copper-nanoparticle lines. This fabrication is based on thermal evaporation of ultrathin layers of copper. These copper layers are deposited on solution-processed thin films formed by few-layer graphene platelets. We show that the annealing of these systems in nitrogen without previous exposure to air prompts the heterogeneous nucleation of the Cu layer into nanoparticle superlattices. And these nanoparticles self-assemble along specific crystallographic directions of graphene. Theoretical calculations suggest the lowest formation energy for Cu-nanoparticle arrays forming along armchair directions, indicating that their self-assembly is energetically more favorable. The possibility of using these superlattices in <b>evanescent</b> <b>waveguiding</b> devices is explored by scanning near-field optical microscopy.

40|$|AbstractMeasuring {{a single}} analyte {{in a highly}} {{absorptive}} microfluidic channel {{has always been a}} challenge. Even with a highly selective sensing layer, other chemical species can affect the interrogation of the analyte. Matching the evanescent tail with the sensing layer thickness is difficult in case of evanescent field sensing. The tail typically extends beyond the sensing layer, introducing noise and spurious errors in the measurement, which scales up with analyte concentration. In this work therefore, we propose the use of a simple multimode <b>evanescent</b> <b>waveguide</b> sensor that eliminates such common spurious effects. The proposed mode-selective sensing system exploits the sensitivity differences between the different guided modes in detecting the effects of the outer medium in the sensor response. The operation of the sensor device relies on the use of an asymmetric waveguide junction, which enable efficient separation of waveguide modes and therefore detection of their differences in behaviour.
