40|$|Xylans {{isolated}} from eucalypt kraft pulps have {{been characterized by}} modern analytical methods. The pulps were partially bleached (DEOPD) and fully bleached with either a final ClO 2 (DEOPDD) or an alkaline H 2 O 2 (DEOPDP) bleaching stage. Alternatively, xylan {{isolated from}} the DEOPD pulp was treated with ClO 2 or with H 2 O 2 under the same conditions as pulps in a <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> stage and were further characterized. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance, size exclusion chromatography, UV-vis spectroscopy in cadoxen solution, and UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy were applied as analytical methods. The final ClO 2 stage generated new unsaturated moieties in xylan, whereas H 2 O 2 was very effective in the removal of xylan-related chromophores. The role of xylan to the delay of brightness development in the final ClO 2 stage was highlighted {{by means of a}} pretreatment with xylanase Pulpzyme HC before the <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> stage. By this approach, the final bleachability of the pulp was boosted and the brightness stability of the fully bleached pulp was improved...|$|E
40|$|Bleaching of soda-anthraquinone jute pulp by {{chlorine}} dioxide (ClO 2) was studied {{to reach a}} target brightness of above 88 % {{for the purpose of}} using less bleaching chemicals. The performance of either {{chlorine dioxide}} or peroxide in the <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> to boost brightness was also studied. The experimental results revealed that the final brightness depended on ClO 2 charge in the Do and D 1 stages. The brightness reversion was lower when the final stage brightening was done by peroxide. The use of Mg(OH) 2 in the D 1 and D 2 stages improved the final brightness due to the formation of less chlorate and chlorite during the Mg(OH) 2 - based ClO 2 brightening stages. The strength properties of pulp bleached by peroxide in the final stage was slightly better than that from ClO 2 as the final ClO 2 bleaching stage...|$|E
40|$|Single terrylenediimide {{molecules}} diluted in a 20 -nm-thick polyvinylbutyral {{polymer film}} were localized and observed by scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. A modular and compact confocal microscope {{and the high}} optical stability of the molecules allowed a repeated imaging and observation over > 5 h at room temperature. Most of the molecules showed several “on-off-on” transitions (blinking) on a time scale from seconds to hours, before permanent bleaching occurred. We determined that > 1. 5 × 10 ^ 7 fluorescence photons are emitted from the most-stable molecules before the <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> step occurs. Despite the “on-off-on” transitions, however, the overall change in fluorescence intensity, either integrated over each image of a time series or summed for several individual molecules, resembled an exponential-like decay, familiar from measurements of many-molecule ensembles. We also observed the polarization of the fluorescence from single molecules during excitation with circular polarized light. From these measurements, possible rotations of the molecular dipoles were studied. Over a span of 5 h, the polarization angle in most cases did not change by > 15 - 20 °. This may explain the slow and small intensity changes but excludes molecular rotation {{as a reason for}} the blinking behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed to evaluate the effect of substituting sodium carbonate for the sodium hydroxide used in peroxide bleaching of spruce CTMP. Three peroxide levels were tested: I, 2, and 4 % HzOz, and two levels of causticsubstitution; SO % and 80 %. At both the 2 % and 4 % peroxide levels, substituting 50 % of the caustic charge with sodium carbonate decreased the initial brightness gain by I point in TAP-PI brightness. At the 80 % caustic substitution level, the brightness gain decreased 1. 5 points. Use of sodium carbonate {{as part of the}} alkali source in the bleaching process reduces the sensitivity of <b>final</b> <b>bleached</b> brightness to the alkali charge and should result in improved control.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this work}} was to study the ability of two {{biodegradable}} chelating agents, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and ethylenediiminopropanedioic acid (EDDM) to complex metals, {{in the treatment of}} the pulp, prior to a totally chlorine free (TCF) bleaching process, and compare with the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) performance. Firstly, speciation efficiency index (SEI) was calculated by computer simulations in order to evaluate the best pH conditions for metal chelating removal: pH range 6. 5 - 7. 0 for NTA and EDDM and pH range 5 - 5. 5 for EDTA. After implementation of the bleaching Q-P 1 -Paa-P 2 sequence, NTA and EDDM removed transition metals (Cu, Fe and Mn) from the pulp more selectively than EDTA.

40|$|BACKGROUNDBrightness {{stability}} of bleached chemical pulps is {{often associated with}} the <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> stages that should provide the removal of chromogenic species responsible for brightness reversion without compromising the papermaking potential. Aiming at promoting higher brightness stability, a partially bleached Eucalyptus globulus pulp (DED) of c. 88 % ISO brightness was involved in a study of a final enzymatic stage (X) alternative to conventional chlorine dioxide (D) and hydrogen peroxide (P) bleaching stages (DEDX vs. DEDD and DEDX vs. DEDP). X stage was also applied before and after the final P or D stages (DEDDX/DEDXD and DEDPX/DEDXP) to produce high brightness pulps (c. 91 %). RESULTSX stage with xylanase Pulpzyme HC allowed an increase of c. 1. 5 % in pulp brightness while decreasing the brightness reversion and a concomitant pulp yield loss of only 0. 5 %. Significant chemical savings were obtained in the final D (70 %) or P (45 %) stages to achieve targeted final brightness of c. 91 %. DEDXD or DEDXP sequences had advantage over DEDDX and DEDPX, respectively, in terms of brightness {{stability of}} fully bleached pulps. CONCLUSIONSXylanase interferes with structures responsible for the brightness reversion. X stage allows production of pulp with extra brightness in sequences with a final P stage.

40|$|Hardwood soda-AQ pulps are {{believed}} to be rich in benzyl sugar ethers (BSE) that can be partially cleaved by aqueous acidic treatments. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of acidolysis on final bleached brightness for kraft and soda-AQ (SAQ) hardwood pulps. The increase in final brightness due to acidolysis at 110 °C was twice as high for a eucalyptus SAQ pulp as compared to the kraft pulp. An oxygen delignified maple C-SAQ pulp (carbonate pre-treated SAQ) was acidolyzed at 120 °C and pH 2. 6 for 30 min. When 1. 60 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used in DEPD <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> of the control sample a brightness of 91. 5 % was achieved. When only 1. 00 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used for the acidolyzed sample a brightness of 92. 0 % was attained. Analyses of the maple pulp after the acidolysis showed no major change in lignin content, brightness, or pulp yield. The minor changes suggest that a facile reaction such as benzyl ether cleavage was responsible for the improved bleachability. Preliminary research involving a lignin model compound and commercial birch xylan showed that lignin-carbohydrate condensation products were generated under SAQ cooking conditions. Furthermore, a fraction of these lignin-carbohydrate moieties were subsequently cleaved by acidolysis at pH 2. 5 and 105 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} the project is the {{environmentally}} harmonized production of high quality dissolving pulps from different domestic raw materials. The process steps prehydrolysis and pulping were optimized using the domestic raw materials beech, spruce, pine as well as eukalyptus which worldwide gains more and more importance as raw material for pulp production. In this project special emphasis {{was put on the}} investigation of the prehydrolysis conditions, whereas in pulping it was limited to the influence of the maximum cooking temperature for the production of high viscosity pulps. Chlorine free bleaching sequences for the produced ASAM dissolving pulp were developed in detail. The process steps oxygen, ozone and peroxide and all corresponding relevant parameters were optimized targeting the environmentally harmonized production of high quality dissolving pulps. By optimizing all process steps of the ASAM dissolving pulp production starting from prehydrolysis till <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> it was possible to produce a pulp quality which is superior to those produced by other pulping processes. This holds true concerning the environmental aspects of production as well as the broad spectrum of technical properties of these pulps which may be suitable {{for a wide range of}} different end products.

40|$|A preocupação com a qualidade da madeira utilizada para a produção de celulose tem sido foco de muitos estudos, uma vez que o processo produtivo e o produto final sofrem grande influência da matéria- prima que lhe deu origem. Considerando a demanda por árvores cada vez mais jovens, o efeito da idade das madeiras na constituição química e nas variáveis de processo, bem como nas características finais da polpa branqueada, torna-se um fato de grande interesse para as indústrias do setor. O objetivo desse estudo foi caracterizar dois clones de eucalipto, sendo um de Eucalyptus grandis (clone A) e outro um híbrido de Eucalyptus grandis com Eucalyptus urophylla (clone B), em diferentes idades (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, e 8 anos), quanto à composição química fina e polpabilidade, bem como a branqueabilidade e as propriedades físicas da polpa deles provenientes. Para isto, as amostras foram coletadas em locais com características de clima e solo homogêneas, evitando-se variações nos resultados devido a estes fatores. A composição química das amostras de ambos os clones avaliados sofreu variação estatisticamente significativa em função da idade das mesmas. O teor de glicanas, bem como o de celulose, tendeu a aumentar com o aumento da idade da árvore. O teor de xilanas, e também dos demais carboidratos componentes das hemiceluloses, tendeu a diminuir com o aumento da idade das árvores. Os teores de ácidos urônicos, grupamentos acetila, lignina, cinzas e a relação S/G diminuíram com o amadurecimento das plantas, enquanto o teor de extrativos sofreu elevação. A densidade básica das madeiras estudadas aumentou com a elevação da idade. As amostras de 5 anos apresentaram os maiores resultados de rendimento de polpação para kappa 17, 0 (RD 17 - 54, 7 e 55, 0 %, para os clones A e B respectivamente). O RD 17 apresentou correlação com o teor de glicanas. A quantidade de HexA&# 8217;s formada não mostrou se correlacionar com a idade das árvores, mas no entanto correlacionou-se muito bem com a carga alcalina aplicada. O menor consumo de cloro ativo total no branqueamento foi obtido pelas polpas oriundas de árvores de 5 anos, sendo de 24, 7 e 23, 5 kg/tsa para os clones A e B respectivamente e também estas amostras, apresentaram os maiores valores de branqueabilidade (0, 47 para ambos os clones). Os valores de reversão de alvura e viscosidade da polpa branqueada foram considerados normais e dentro de padrões aceitáveis. As únicas amostras que fecharam com um custo final de branqueamento abaixo de US$ 40, 00 /tsa, foram as originadas de madeiras de 5 anos. O consumo de energia de refino e o índice de rasgo, para um mesmo índice de tração, foram maiores para madeiras mais velhas, ao contrário da resistência à passagem de ar, que tendeu a diminuir com o aumento da idade. The {{concern about}} the quality of the wood that enters a {{cellulose}} factory has been focused on many studies, once the productive process and final product are under great influence of the original raw material. Considering the demand for younger trees, the effect of the age of the wood in the chemical constitution and the variables of the process, as well as the bleached pulp final characteristic, becomes a fact of great interest for the industries of the sector. The objective of this study was to characterize two Eucalyptus clones, Eucalyptus grandis (clone A) and Eucalyptus urograndis (clone B) both of different ages (1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years), as for the thin chemical composition and pulping, such the pulp bleachability and physical properties. For that the samples were collected in spots such as the climate and soil characteristics were homogeneous, preventing results variations due to these elements. Both chemical compositions of the clone samples suffered significant statistic variations due to the variation of their age. The concentration of the glicans, as well of the cellulose, tended to raise with the increase of the age of the tree. The concentration of xylans, and the others carbohydrates composing the hemicelluloses, tended to decrease with the increase of the age of the trees. The uronic acids, acetyl groups, lignin, ashes and the ratio S/G lessened with the maturing of the plants, while the extractive concentration increase. The basic density of the wood studied rose with the raise of the age. The 5 years samples presented the greatest pulping yield results for kappa 17. 0 (RD 17 &# 8211; 54. 7 and 55. 0 % for the A and B clones respectively). The RD 17 presented correlation with the glican concentration. The HeXA&# 8217;s quantity formed had no relation with the age of the trees, however it did related very well with the alkaline applied charge. The lesser total active chlorine consumption in the bleaching was obtained by the 5 year tree pulps, being 24. 7 and 23. 5 kg/adt for the clones A and B respectively and also these samples, presented the major bleachability values (0. 47 for both). The brightness reversion and bleached pulp viscosity values were considered normal and within the acceptable patterns. The only samples that had <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> cost below US$ 40. 00 /adt were the ones originated from the 5 year wood.

40|$|As {{early as}} 1971, some Sudanese researchers, started to {{investigate}} the potentiality of the locally available fibrous raw materials for forest industries, namely pulp and papermaking. As part of this project and to coupe with the most recent pulping and bleaching technologies, six wood species (Acacia seyal var. seyal; Acacia seyal var. fistula; Eucalyptus citriodora; E. tereticornis; E. camaldulensis; and E. microtheca were investigated in the present study. The overall objective {{of this research is}} to add to the knowledge about the pulping potential of the Sudanese raw materials for future pulp and paper industry. The specific objectives are: 1) to find out the environmentally most suitable activated alkaline pulping method for each of the six species; and 2) to establish the optimum totally chlorine-free bleaching sequence for each of the pulps obtained. The two Acacia samples were collected from the Blue Nile State (South East of the Sudan), Eucalyptus citriodora and tereticornis were collected from Gebel Merra Forests (Darfur, West of the Sudan), and E. camaldulensis and E. microtheca were collected from Kenana Sugar Company Forest (Central Sudan). The basic density of Acacia seyal var. fistula was of 669 and var. seyal of 692 kg/m 3, which are above the average of the usual density range for commercial pulpwood. E. citriodora, E. tereticornis, E. camaldulensis and E. microtheca were in the range of 531 - 695 kg/m 3. The bark-to-wood ratios of the six studied species were within the acceptable range for the pulpwood and even somewhat lower in the young Acacias. The average fiber lengths of Acacia seyal var. seyal and var. fistula were found to be short (0. 8 mm) whereas their wall was found to be thin, especially for var. fistula (2. 3 and 1. 4 μm respectively). On the other hand the fiber lengths of Eucalyptus citriodora and camaldulensis (0. 8 mm) were {{similar to that of the}} two varieties of Acacia seyal xvi whereas that of E. tereticornis (0. 5 mm) was noticeably short. Their fiber width is comparatively thin and also similar to that of the Acacia. The variety seyal was found to be of somewhat higher cellulose content (46. 5 % compared to 45. 3 % in variety fistula) but the variety fistula had lower lignin content (18. 3 % compared to 19. 1 % in variety seyal). The eucalypts were found to be of low ash content (0. 8 %) and also low silica contents (0. 1 %). They had lower extractives content compared to the two Acacias. Eucalyptus citriodora was of the highest cellulose content among the six studied species (48. 2 %) whereas E. microtheca was of the lowest (42. 3 %). E. citriodora and tereticornis had considerably higher lignin content than that of the Acacias (22. 7 and 23. 5 % respectively). Four cooking methods were applied: kraft; kraft-AQ; soda-AQ; AS-AQ; and ASAM, except for E. camaldulensis and E. microtheca where only kraft and ASAM were applied. Totally chlorine-free (TFC) bleaching was carried out for kraft and ASAM pulps of Acacia seyal var. fistula and Eucalyptus citriodora. Five-stage bleaching sequence (O/Q/OP/Q/P) was applied. Kappa number for Acacia seyal var. fistula pulps was found to be around 20 in kraft, kraft-AQ, soda-AQ and AS-AQ cooks but it was considerably lower in ASAM cooks (14. 1 and 16. 9). The lowest pulp yield was produced in kraft cook of Acacia seyal var. seyal (42. 2 %) and highest in ASAM 1 of Eucalyptus citriodora (48. 0 %). Negligible rejects were noticed in kraft, kraft-AQ and soda-AQ, while in AS-AQ and ASAM cooks somewhat higher but still acceptable rejects were attained. The unbleached pulps produced in ASAM cooks showed considerably high initial ISO brightness compared to the other pulps. E. citriodora seemed to be easier to cook than the other eucalypts and especially E. tereticornis even when higher alkali charge was employed for the latter. The kappa number attained ranged between 22 in soda-AQ down to 13. 8 in ASAM 1 for E. xvii citriodora and between 31. 9 in kraft and soda-AQ to 27. 1 in kraft-AQ for E. tereticornis. For E. camaldulensis the kappa numbers were 24. 4 and 20. 3 in kraft and ASAM pulps respectively and 25. 8 and 26. 0 in kraft and ASAM pulps of E. microtheca. E. tereticornis was found to behave somewhat different as compared to the Acacias or even to the other eucalypts. Extra alkali charges were needed in AS-AQ cooks to obtain pulps of acceptable degree of delignification with acceptable rejects. ASAM pulps of Acacia seyal var. fistula were of the highest tensile strength (70. 9 - 77. 7 Nm/g) compared to the other pulps, the tensile index of AS-AQ 1 resembles that of ASAM pulps whereas AS-AQ 2 and soda-AQ pulps were of the lowest tensile strength (58. 9 and 54. 8 Nm/g, respectively). Bleaching process did not affect the tensile strength. Also the ASAM pulps of this species were of the highest tear and burst strengths. AS-AQ 1 and ASAM 2 pulp of Acacia seyal var. seyal were of the highest tensile index (72. 5 and 72 Nm/g respectively). ASAM 2 pulp of this species was of the highest tear (10. 2 mN*m 2 /g) and soda-AQ the lowest (7. 5 mN*m 2 /g). Burst strength was highest in ASAM 2 and lowest in soda-AQ (4. 9 and 3. 4 kPam 2 /g, respectively). Kraft, kraft-AQ and soda-AQ pulps of Eucalyptus citriodora were found to be of higher tensile index compared to the Acacias ones (76. 9, 75. 2 and 61. 7 Nm/g respectively) but those of AS-AQ 1 and ASAM pulps were more or less similar to those of Acacia seyal var. fistula and somewhat higher than of var. seyal. ASAM pulps of E. camaldulensis and E. microtheca had fairly higher tensile index (81. 7 and 80. 6 Nm/g respectively) compared to kraft pulps (73. 1 and 68. 6 Nm/g respectively). ASAM pulps were of also higher burst strength. Tear index (8. 7 mN*m 2 /g) of E. camaldulensis ASAM pulp was higher than that of kraft pulp while in E. microtheca tear index was the same (7. 1 mN*m 2 /g). xviii Since the two Acacias mostly behave similar and Eucalyptus citriodora was found to be the best of the Eucalyptuses,. Acacia seyal var. fistula and E. citriodora kraft and ASAM pulps were chosen for Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequence. The ISO brightness of 88. 3 and 88. 9 % were attained at the <b>final</b> <b>bleaching</b> stage for kraft and ASAM pulps of Acacia seyal var. fistula and 88. 9 and 87. 5 % for Eucalyptus citriodora, respectively. Considerable loss of viscosity is noticed, 914 ml/g viscosity of the unbleached AF 2 pulp was dropped to reach down to 700 ml/g. More severe loss was noticed in the EC 2 (1129 ml/g for the unbleached pulp compared to 732 ml/g). This may be attributed to the removal of a considerable portion of the remained hemicelluloses. The viscosity of AF 10 bleached pulp was found to be 902 ml/g compared to 1112 for the unbleached pulp whereas in EC 19 pulp it was 821 and 1173 m/g...|$|E

In this study, the application of peroxymonosulfuric acid (H 2 SO 5 : Psa) to TCF bleaching was proposed as a modification of the {{bleaching process}} of hardwood prehydrolysis-kraft pulp. Acacia mearnsii pulps were treated by oxygen bleaching, followed by Psa treatment, ozone bleaching, alkali extraction, and finally, hydrogen peroxide bleaching. The Psa treatment was conducted with 10  % pulp consistency at pH 3 and 70  °C. The use of Psa increased the removal of hexenuronic acid from the pulp and improved pulp brightness. After the <b>final</b> hydrogen peroxide <b>bleaching,</b> pulp brightness increased to 86.0  % ISO with a 0.6  % Psa dosage. The Psa treatment showed better selectivity, i.e., kappa number decrement per unit of viscosity, compared with ozone bleaching. A dosage of 0.2  % Psa afforded a 3.4 kappa number decrement with a 10.9 cP viscosity loss, while ozone treatment with a dosage of 0.5  % resulted in a 2.6 kappa number decrement with a 12.5 cP viscosity loss. The {{results showed that the}} Psa treatment can enhance pulp quality in terms of brightness and reduce ozone consumption, which improves the TCF bleaching process.|$|R

40|$|In {{integrated}} factories of {{pulp and}} paper, the bleaching control {{is made by}} kappa number and/or brightness. However, the product paper is evaluated and valued for its whiteness. The level of final brightness of pulp certainly affects the demand for optical brighteners in paper manufacturing, nevertheless, {{there is not a}} direct correlation between consump tion of optical brightener and final brightness, being the method of bleaching pulp, especially from the <b>final</b> stage of <b>bleaching,</b> also important in relation to this demand. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of using the parameter whiteness as a tool to control bleaching pulp, instead of the traditional brightness and evaluate the impacts of different methods of bleaching and the pulp final brightness level in action of optical brighteners, to improve their per formance. It was observed that the whiteness and brightness of the pulp are highly correlated and that the control of the bleaching plant can be done by any one of these two parameters. It was also concluded that, considering current prices of bleaching reagents and of optical brighteners, it is better to bleach the pulp up to lower brightness values (e. g. 88 % ISO) and use larger amounts of optical brighteners to brighten the mass until the whiteness of 130 CIE. This conclusion is valid for whiteness measured before the size press. Further studies are needed to validate this conclusion considering the finished product. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Development of new {{materials}} for tooth bleaching justifies {{the need for}} studies to evaluate {{the changes in the}} enamel surface caused by different bleaching protocols. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the bovine dental enamel wear in function of different bleaching gel protocols, acid etching and pH variation. Material and Methods Sixty fragments of bovine teeth were cut, obtaining a control and test areas. In the test area, one half received etching followed by a bleaching gel application, and the other half, only the bleaching gel. The fragments were randomly divided into six groups (n= 10), each one received one bleaching session with five hydrogen peroxide gel applications of 8 min, activated with hybrid light, diode laser/blue LED (HL) or diode laser/violet LED (VHL) (experimental) : Control (C); 35 % Total Blanc Office (TBO 35 HL); 35 % Lase Peroxide Sensy (LPS 35 HL); 25 % Lase Peroxide Sensy II (LPS 25 HL); 15 % Lase Peroxide Lite (LPL 15 HL); and 10 % hydrogen peroxide (experimental) (EXP 10 VHL). pH values were determined by a pHmeter at the initial and final time periods. Specimens were stored, subjected to simulated brushing cycles, and the superficial wear was determined (μm). ANOVA and Tukey´s tests were applied (α= 0. 05). Results The pH showed a slight decrease, except for Group LPL 15 HL. Group LPS 25 HL showed the highest degree of wear, with and without etching. Conclusion There was a decrease from the initial to the <b>final</b> pH. Different <b>bleaching</b> gels were able to increase the surface wear values after simulated brushing. Acid etching before bleaching increased surface wear values in all groups...|$|R
40|$|General Information Thick {{pieces of}} wood, such as logs or boards, cannot be {{bleached}} satisfactorily {{all the way}} through. Wood should be made into the furniture or other find product, and then the surface bleached if desired Woods differ in {{the ease with which}} they can be bleached. Oak, birch, mahogany, ash, maple, beech, and walnut can be bleached fairly easily gum, tupelo, pine, and poplar are said {{to be very difficult to}} bleach satisfactorily. If varnish, stain, or other finishing material is present on wood surface that is to be bleached, it must be removed completely before bleaching is started. Even waxy materials left on the wood by varnish removers may interfere with the action of <b>bleaching</b> chemicals. A <b>final</b> sanding before <b>bleaching</b> is desirable in such cases. Where stain has penetrated into the wood, scraping or sanding until all of the stained wood has been removed is usually necessary. The wood bleaches may not bleach the dyes or pigments used in wood stains. Many bleaching chemicals are injurious to the skin and eyes. Goggles, heavy rubber gloves, and aprons should be worn when handling and applying wood bleaches, particularly those containing hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide. Reasons for Bleaching Woods such as walnut or mahogany, which are naturally dark in color, may be bleached to a lighter color or even to white, and light-colored woods may be made lighter, in conformity with the vogue for light-colored, or blond, furniture. 1 Only a Iimited amount of experimental work on the bleaching of wood has been done at the Forest Products Laboratory. The information presented here is based chiefly on the published literature and on materiaI suppIied by makers and users of wood bleaches. This Researc...|$|R
