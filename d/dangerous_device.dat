2500|$|In Daleks Among Us, Davros {{returns to}} Azimuth, a planet that was invaded by the Daleks long ago, {{presenting}} {{himself as a}} victim of Dalek enslavement to infiltrate an underground movement against the repressive government- so desperate to prevent riots about individual actions during the Dalek occupation that official policy is now that the Dalek invasion never happened- seeking the remnants of an old experiment he carried out on the planet. This experiment is revealed to be Falkus, a clone of Davros's original body that was intended to be a new host for his mind, with Falkus having evolved an independent personality since the Daleks left Azimuth. Falkus attempts to acquire the Persuasion Machine, a <b>dangerous</b> <b>device</b> that the Seventh Doctor has been tracking with his companions Elizabeth Klein and Will Arrowsmith, but the Doctor is able to trick Falkus into using the reprogrammed Persuasion Machine to destroy himself and his Daleks, while Davros flees in an escape pod. Davros is last shown trapped on the planet Lamuria, faced with the spectral former residents of the planet who sought to punish all criminals in the universe.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{subtitle}} C, various definitions {{relating to}} terrorism were altered and expanded. The INA was retroactively amended to disallow aliens {{who are part}} of or representatives of a foreign organization or any group who endorses acts of terrorism from entering the U.S. This restriction also included the family of such aliens. The definition of [...] "terrorist activity" [...] was strengthened to include actions involving the use of any <b>dangerous</b> <b>device</b> (and not just explosives and firearms). To [...] "engage in terrorist activity" [...] is defined as committing, inciting to commit or planning and preparing to undertake an act of terrorism. Included in this definition is the gathering of intelligence information on potential terrorist targets, the solicitation of funds for a terrorist organization or the solicitation of others to undertake acts of terrorism. Those who provide knowing assistance to a person who is planning to perform such activities are defined as undertaking terrorist activities. Such assistance includes affording material support, including a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training to perform the terrorist act. The INA criteria for making a decision to designate an organization as a terrorist organization was amended to include the definition of a terrorist act. Though the amendments to these definitions are retroactive, {{it does not mean that}} it can be applied to members who joined an organization, but since left, before it was designated to be a terrorist organization under [...] by the Secretary of State.|$|E

40|$|U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalls {{of medical}} devices are at {{historically}} high levels despite efforts by manufacturers to meet stringent agency requirements to ensure quality and patient safety. A {{factor in the}} release of potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>devices</b> might be the interpretations of nonnormal test data by statistically unsophisticated engineers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that testing by lot provides a better indicator of true process behavior than process capability indices (PCIs) calculated from the mixed lots that often occur in a typical production situation. The foundations of this research were in the prior work of Bertalanffy, Kane, Shewhart, and Taylor. The research questions examined whether lot traceability allows the decomposition of the combination distribution to allow more accurate calculations of PCIs used to monitor medical device production. The study was semiexperimental, using simulated data. While the simulated data were random, the study was a quasiexperimental design because of the control of the simulated data through parameter selection. The results of this study indicate that decomposition does not increase the accuracy of the PCI. The conclusion is that a systems approach using the PCI, additional statistical tools, and expert knowledge could yield more accurate results than could decomposition alone. More accurate results could ensure the production of safer medical devices by correctly identifying noncapable processes (i. e., processes that may not produce required results), while also preventing needless waste of resources and delays in potentially life-savings technology, reaching patients in cases where processes evaluate as noncapable when they are actually capable...|$|R

40|$|Geography {{and field}} {{work in the}} Soviet {{borderline}} zone Tiina Peil, University of Tallinn   In this paper I examine the range of spatial, material and corporeal practices constructive of (geographical) fieldwork in a Soviet frame where ‘it was secret what was secret’. Estonia, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945, formed its north-western border to Northern Europe and thus movement in the coastal areas and at sea came under strict control and subject to permitting. Nevertheless, some Estonian scientists continued to pursue field studies. An analysis of what their work entailed in between the 1950 s and 1980 s with special attention on surveying {{and the role of}} maps (which in official view were considered to be extremely powerful and <b>dangerous</b> <b>devices)</b> is attempted based on in-depth interviews and field diaries. The period was by no means uniform and the subtle changes in the system’s performance provide insights into its functioning. This with its physical manifestations of checkpoints and military installations and encounters with the Soviet armed forces, as well as mental manipulation of people forms my primary focus. However, the ethics and politics of fieldwork and publishing, as well as the ambiguous identity of the field scientist are highlighted in these extreme conditions where geography – often defined as a discipline of critical observation – was exercised under constant observation. In reflection, Soviet geography had to do without two of the discipline’s key components: it could not openly discuss issues around human—environment relationships as people were banished from the landscapes, and not use maps, either as a source or for presenting the findings...|$|R
40|$|Concern over acts of {{terrorism}} has emerged in recent decades and was greatly heightened by the events {{that took place in}} New York City on September 11, 2001. Since then, substantial attention has been devoted to addressing the possible scenarios that may arise from the use of various hazardous materials or <b>dangerous</b> <b>devices</b> for terrorist acts. Some of these efforts are associated with radiological hazards, such as radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) and improvised nuclear devices (INDs). By far, however, most preparedness efforts have focused on responding to the early phases of events, including triage to rescue lives or avoidance of initial exposure by evacuating or sheltering the affected populations, rather than the long-term recovery issues that may last for several years. Such lack of preparedness has raised considerable concern, as exemplified by the issues raised in a report by the General Accountability Office in January 2010. The concerns are based on past nuclear events, such as the 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Former Soviet Union; the natural disaster caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005; and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In all these events, a general lack of preparedness capability for long-term recovery has fully illustrated the need for response that must go far beyond the initial triaging effort. The desired preparedness effort should consider long-term recovery issues that likely will encompass the entire spectrum from public policy, to impact analysis, to technology development, as well as stakeholder involvement in decision making. All these aspects require considerable in-depth development and preparation, much of it far in advance of the events...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Several {{authorities}} have documented {{a significant decrease}} in support for modern eye pathology/pathology research laboratories. Indeed, many laboratories have closed or suffered marked cutbacks. The purpose of this report is to ask why this is so and to seek a possible means for reversing this trend. METHODS: Observations from the senior author's experience and a case from author's facility are analyzed. RESULTS: There are several reasons for ocular pathologists' difficulties, such as financial problems, lack of vision, personality conflicts, and problems with the departmental administration. Until recently, most research and development in several subspecialty fields of ophthalmology, including biodevices research, has been done primarily by engineers and in-house workers in industry. This precludes proper independent, nonbiased control and guidance from academia. Most ocular pathologists have not participated in this relatively new and wide-open field. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a new realm of activity for today's newly trained ocular pathologists. Based on personal experience of two decades of fruitful collaboration with industry, we believe that ocular pathologists are uniquely trained to apply their expertise to various new fields of research that most pathologists today have not utilized. An important example is research on clinicopathological aspects of implantable biodevices. In addition, support and oversight should be provided by the major ophthalmic societies, such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology, in order to retain (even regain) control over this field. This is mandatory in order to control the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices being introduced almost daily. Only then can clear differentiation between profit and patient welfare be achieved as potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>devices</b> and techniques are let loose on the market. The field of "routine, descriptive" eye pathology is severely wounded and will return only in an attenuated fashion. In general, full-time support for ocular pathologists will not be possible unless they seek extra support from the private sector, engage in a concurrent clinical practice, or are supported by an endowed chair (a wonderful alternative) ...|$|R
