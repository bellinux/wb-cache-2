Eggen was an enormously productive scientist, but was [...] "enigmatic", [...] "somewhat gruff" [...] and selective in the friendships he formed. Although Eggen and Gascoigne had previously collaborated on research projects, when Eggen arrived {{to take up the}} post, he and Gascoigne did not get on well, in contrast to Gascoigne's relationships with other astronomers.

The need for industry-specific training programs (ISTPs) is addressed. An overview follevs of how to develop the capacity needei in state and local organizations to design and implement industry-specific programs. A section on marketing outlines some factors that training providers should consider in developing a marketing plan. The next section relates the elementt of program design to ISTPs. It enumerates the characteristics of_good programs and focuses on tailoring program design elements to ISTPS, Barriers to program development are also identified.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the assumption that}} activity time is independent of firm size (measured {{by the number of}} employees). Existing theories on (dis) economies of scale and scope and wage differentials are unclear on what to expect. For relatively complex activities such as becoming familiar with information obligations or checking agreements and declarations, the activity time might be related to the number of employees. For activities such as receiving, copying and sending <b>information</b> and <b>documents,</b> <b>no</b> theoretical arguments have been identified that suggest a firm-size effect. For the empirical examination of the existence of a relationship between firm size and activity time, data is used that were gathered in two projects applying the MISTRAL approach. This results in a dataset with information on many different activities, with only a few observations for each activity. By using a relative measure for activity time, observations for different activities can be combined in the analysis. To this end, relative activity time is defined as the ratio between the measured activity time and the standardized activity time for a certain activity. The empirical results suggest that, within the examined policy areas, firm size has no noticeable relationship with activity times. First of all, there exists no significant difference in average relative activity time between firms of different size classes. There are also no significant correlations between these variables. Next, these results are confirmed by regression analysis, where relative activity time is estimated as a function of firm size and other variables that might be of influence on activity time (such as experience of employees, the presence of a specific department for administrative activities, and whether additional adaptations and/or computations are required for a specific activity). Relative activity time tends to be higher for activities that require additional adaptations, but is independent {{of the size of the}} firm. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an outgrowth of}} research performed with a data base of merged individual income tax returns and <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> Tax Year 1989 was the first year for which such a data base was created and perfected. Traditionally, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service has interpreted its mandate to produce "statistics reasonably available {{with respect to the}} operations of the internal revenue laws " [1] as meaning tabulating data shown on tax returns. In recent years, with the computerization of the millions of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> prepared by employers, banks, stock brokers, payers of pensions, etc., data from these documents have increasingly become "reasonably available. " Data from <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> when matched to tax returns, can be used to serve as a check on the data shown on individual income tax returns, as well as to provide an indication of how much of the income on a joint return belongs to the husband and how much to the wife. In addition, it is possible to pull a sample of <b>information</b> <b>documents</b> that do not match to tax returns, and use them to tally data about non-filers. The data base used for this paper was created as a tool to compare tax return data to data gathered from <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> It includes a sample of tax returns matched to <b>information</b> <b>documents,</b> as well as unmatched tax returns and unmatched <b>information</b> <b>documents.</b> The age of each individual in the sample was determined by matching his or her social security number (SSN) to the Year of Birth file, whic...|$|R
