40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of aluminium}} at 25 ℃ {{was investigated in}} 3 <b>decinormal</b> <b>solution</b> on the pH range 2 [...] 10. Effects of hydrated aluminium oxide and anhydrous aluminium oxide on the corrosion of aluminium in neutral salt solution were studied by means of measurments of corrosion test, titration of Al^, and solubility of anhydrous oxide. The experimental results obtained were as follows. (1) Used anions were divided into 2 groups: First type was not affected solubility of anhydrous aluminium oxide on the aluminium surface in neutral solution. Second type was affected solubility of anhydrous aluminium oxide and corrosive behavior was decreased proportionately with dcreasing solubi 1 ity. The first type anions were Cl^- and S 0 _ 4 {{and the other was}} C_ 6 H_ 6 O_ 7 ^-. The corrosion of aluminium in S 0 _ 4 ^ solution was uniform and in case of Cl^-, near pH 7 local conosion occurred. While in case of C_ 6 H_ 60 _ 7 ^, corrosion was not inhibited near pH 7 and was uniform. (2) The corrosive behavior of aluminium were more affected by the stability of anhydrous aluminium oxide film than by the change of solubility of hydrated aluminium oxide in S 0 _ 4 ^ and Cl^- solution. While in case of C_ 6 H_ 60 _ 7 ^, corrosion was affected the formation of soluble aluminium complex salt. (3) The oxgen takes little effect on the corrsive behavior near pH 7. While it was affected toward active in corrosion at other range. 中性溶液中におけるAlおよびその合金の腐食挙動を追求することは，これらの材料の実用上きわめて重要であるが，この問題については従来主として分極法を用いてAlの腐食挙動やAlの電気化学的特性を追求した報告が見られる程度で，その腐食機構ならびにイオン種による影響についての検討はかならずしも十分とはいえないようである。そこで著者らは前報で中性溶液中におけるAlの腐食挙動を総合的に解明する一段階として，これらの溶液中におけるAlの腐食のカソード反応に対するアニオンの作用について考察した。引続いて本報では，中性溶液中でのAlの腐食が活性な金属面で進行するのではなく，酸化物におおわれた状態で進行するので，Alの水酸化物の生成挙動ならびに酸化物の溶解度に対するアニオンの作用を測定して，これらの因子と実際の腐食挙動との関連性を明らかにするため腐食試験を行なって検討を行なった...|$|E
40|$|IN a {{previous}} publication {{one of us}} (J. F.) (1) formed the conclusion— based on the examination of 100 cases—that though the Bendien chemical test possessed little value in diagnosis, it appeared likely to be of use as a prognostic test since the results varied according {{to the type of}} cases examined, {{in the same way as}} the results of a sedimentation test might vary. Bendien (2) himself claims that his test is a superior prognostic test to the sedimentation rate, but does not offer convincing data in support of this claim. It appeared to us desirable to investigate this claim, for even if the Bendien test were proved to be as reliable as—but no more reliable than— the sedimentation test, the former still possessed certain advantages of con-venience over the latter. It is a serum test, and the serum can be used a few days after it is obtained from the patient without affecting the result. Moreover, the serum can be transmitted (by post or messenger) to a labora-tory. The sedimentation test,. on the other hand, ties one to the patient and to the clock in a manner that must definitely limit its application. The investigation consisted in blood examinations of thirty-six patients, most of them at fortnightly intervals over a period of five months. One of us (J. F.) carried out the Bendien tests, while the other (D. M. D.) was responsible for the sedimentation tests and for the clinical observations. Technique of the Bendien Chemical Test adopted The original Bendien technique was departed from considerably, being inconvenient for clinical purposes. The following was briefly the routine adopted:— 1. <b>Decinormal</b> <b>solutions</b> of sodium vanadate and of acetic acid were pre-pared, and from these the Bendien reagents were made up.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of Al 6063 -TiO 2 particulate composites in {{sodium sulphate}} medium {{has been studied}} in the present investigation. The unreinforced matrix, and the composites containing 2, 4 & 6 by weight of TiO 2 particulates were prepared by liquid metallurgy route using vortex technique. Their corrosion behaviour was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization method in <b>decinormal</b> and normal <b>solutions</b> of sodium sulphate. The open circuit potential (OCP) measurements and the potentiodynamic polarisation experiments revealed that the composites are susceptible to corrosion compared with their matrix alloy. The observed Small shift of OCP values to the negative side in composites is indicative of defect oxide layer formation {{in the presence of}} reinforcement in the matrix alloy. Polarisation curves in <b>decinormal</b> and normal <b>solutions</b> of sodium sulphate showed that the Corrosion rates and corrosion current density (Icorr) values for both matrix and composites increase with increase in concentration of sodium sulphate solution. Moreover, the corrosion rates of the composites markedly increases with increase in the TiO 2 content The presence of reinforcement in matrix acting as cathodic region increases with increasing TiO 2 content and increases the corresponding cathode to anode ratio in composites, resulting in the formation of pits during localised corrosion. The observed lower corrosion resistance in composites could be attributed to the microgalvanic coupling between the interfacial products formed during composite fabrication such as, Mg 2 Si, AlTi 3 and Matrix alloy. Insulator TiO 2 particulates are perceived to act as inert material and degrade the integrity of the protective oxide layer on the Al matrix alloy. Â© Research India Publications...|$|R
