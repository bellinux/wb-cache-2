5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must <b>exist.</b> Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to <b>exist</b> in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to <b>exist,</b> God must <b>exist</b> to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
