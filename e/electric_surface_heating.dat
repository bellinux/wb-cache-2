40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow {{is a key}} {{parameter}} for the geothermal structure, rheology, {{and hence}} the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow measurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the stable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a method to infer <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a Parker's-like formula. This formula provides {{the relationship between the}} Fourier transform of <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of the powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the continental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three dimensional distribution of the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow can be calculated accurately by this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a 1 ^∘× 1 ^∘ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model. Comparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred are less than 20 %, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are rare or absent.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the complex coupling between <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and local fluid velocity in convective heat transfer, advanced techniques {{are required to}} measure the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux at high spatial and temporal resolution. Several established flow velocity techniques such as laser Doppler anemometry, particle image velocimetry and hot wire anemometry can measure fluid velocities at high spatial resolution (?m) and have a high-frequency response (up to 100 kHz) characteristic. Equivalent advanced <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer measurement techniques, however, are not available; even the latest advances in high speed thermal imaging do not offer equivalent data capture rates. The current research presents a method of measuring point <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux with a hot film that is flush mounted on a <b>heated</b> flat <b>surface.</b> The film {{works in conjunction with}} a constant temperature anemometer which has a bandwidth of 100 kHz. The bandwidth of this technique therefore is likely to be in excess of more established <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement techniques. Although the frequency response of the sensor is not reported here, it is expected to be significantly less than 100 kHz due to its physical size and capacitance. To demonstrate the efficacy of the technique, a cooling impinging air jet is directed at the <b>heated</b> <b>surface,</b> and the power required to maintain the hot-film temperature is related to the local heat flux to the fluid air flow. The technique is validated experimentally using a more established <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement technique. The thermal performance of the sensor is also investigated numerically. It has been shown that, with some limitations, the measurement technique accurately measures the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> transfer to an impinging air jet with improved spatial resolution {{for a wide range of}} experimental parameters...|$|R

However, local maxima in the <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow correlate with the shape of the Burano unit (see Figs.  9,  13) within which topography-driven advective heat transport takes place at relatively shallow depths. These maxima in <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow are good indicators of structural highs of the shallow reservoir.|$|R

An expression is derived which relates <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> flow to time, heat flow through the deep lithosphere, the distribution of heat sources and the amount and time constant of erosion.

40|$|Analyses {{of data on}} clouds, winds, and <b>surface</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes {{show that}} the {{transient}} behavior of basin-wide large-scale circulation has a significant influence on the warm pool sea surface temperature (SST). Trade winds converge to regions of the highest SST in the equatorial western Pacific. These regions have the largest cloud cover and smallest wind speed. Both <b>surface</b> solar <b>heating</b> and evaporative cooling are weak. The reduced evaporative cooling due to weakened winds exceeds the reduced solar heating due to enhanced cloudiness. The result is a maximum <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> in the strong convective and high SST regions. Data also show that the maximum <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> in strong convective regions is interrupted by transient atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Due to the seasonal variation of the insolation {{at the top of}} the atmosphere, trade winds and clouds also experience seasonal variations. Regions of high SST and low-level convergence follow the Sun, where the <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> is a maximum. As the Sun moves away from a convective region, the strong trade winds set in, and the evaporative cooling enhances, resulting in a net cooling of the surface. During an El Nino, the maximum SST and convective region shifts eastward from the maritime continent to the equatorial central Pacific. Following the eastward shift of the maximum SST, the region of maximum cloudiness and <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> also shift eastward. As the atmospheric and oceanic circulation returns to normal situations, the trade winds increase and the <b>surface</b> <b>heating</b> decreases. We conclude that the evaporative cooling associated with the seasonal and interannual variations of trade winds is one of the major factors that modulate the SST distribution of the Pacific warm pool...|$|R
