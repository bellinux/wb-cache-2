But can YOU mean you, if YOU means me and them as well? YOU puts into question {{the very idea of}} identity. This equivocality of where one YOU begins and the other ends, the questioning of the subject position and of the object of that subject's gaze, is what is explored in Taras Polataiko's YOU series. In this thesis, I seek to face the question of identity in terms of self/portraiture. Centring my discussion around YOU, a series of self-portraits by Ukrainian-born Canadian artist Taras Polataiko, I will face the question of identity first with regard to portraiture, by defining the aspects of the self a portrait aims to encapsulate; second as applied in YOU, when the series is read through a Lacanian lens; and third, as taken to its il -logical conclusion: the YOULOGY of a notio...|$|R

6000|$|It was {{not till}} 1762, when Johnson was fifty-three years old, that his {{literary}} labors were rewarded {{in the usual}} way by royalty, and he received from George III a yearly pension of three hundred pounds. Then began a little sunshine in his life. With Joshua Reynolds, the artist, he founded the famous Literary Club, of which Burke, Pitt, Fox, Gibbon, Goldsmith, and indeed all the great literary men and politicians of the time, were members. This is the period of Johnson's famous conversations, which were caught in minutest detail by Boswell and given to the world. His idea of conversation, as shown in a hundred places in Boswell, is to overcome your adversary at any cost; to knock him down by arguments, or, when these fail, by personal ridicule; to dogmatize on every possible question, pronounce a few oracles, and then desist with the air of victory. Concerning the philosopher Hume's view of death he says: [...] "Sir, if he really thinks so, his perceptions are disturbed, he is mad. If he does not think so, he lies." [...] Exit opposition. There is nothing more to be said. Curiously enough, it is often the palpable blunders of these monologues that now attract us, {{as if we were}} enjoying a good joke at the dictator's expense. Once a lady asked him, [...] "Dr. Johnson, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>define</b> pastern as the knee of a horse?" [...] "Ignorance, madame, pure ignorance," [...] thundered the great authority.|$|R

But as to whether such hallucinations, among the sane, are ever caused by psychical influences from the minds of others, alive or dead, not communicated through the ordinary channels of sense, my mind is in a balance of doubt.

30|$|The {{interview}} included nine questions: {{two about}} demographics {{such as age}} and gender, five about preferred tracking functions, and two about suggestions for wearable technology product designs. Five questions about tracking functions were used to answer research questions 1 and 2 on the designs and functions consumer wanted: (1) self-defining qualities: what qualities <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel <b>define</b> who <b>you</b> are? (Schüll 2016); (2) tracking dimensions for self: ‘what dimensions of yourself {{would you like to}} track?’ (Koo and Fallon 2017; Preusse et al. 2016; Viseu and Suchman 2010); (3) knowing about others: what would you be interested to know about others? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Michaelis et al. 2016); (4) sharing about self: what qualities <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish the world knew about you? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Lamb et al. 2016); (5) conceal about self: what qualities of yourself <b>do</b> <b>you</b> attempt to conceal? (Koo and Fallon 2017; Lamb et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016). The two questions about product design suggestions were asked: (1) what aspects <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like and dislike about current products? (Preusse et al. 2016) and (2) <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have any suggestions for improving the design and function of current wearable products in the market? (Michaelis et al. 2016; Preusse et al. 2016). Based on UTAUT and TAM, modifications and reinforcements could be made to wearable trackers that would enhance users’ positive attitudes toward the devices based on the results. Such positive attitudes influence users’ acceptance of new technologies (Wu et al. 2016).|$|R

This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference Peano met Bertrand Russell and gave him a copy of Formulario.

5000|$|The first {{argument}} {{commonly used}} [...] against legislation is “How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>define</b> a design so it cannot be copyrighted?”. This problem already has its solution.Designers {{included in the}} list of those with stolen designs and who are part of the campaign for protection include but are not limited to: Diane Von Furstenberg, Narciso Rodriquez, Zac Posen, and Yves Saint Laurent. The fight is said to be not against lower priced merchants selling clothes that follow the seasonal fashion trends, but against blatant copying of runway looks, such as dresses or jackets that use the exact color, detail, and structure as pieces that had already debuted under previous designers. These less expensive replicates of previous designs are impacting the luxury business in ways that cause decline in the revenue for luxury designers. Instead of spending the money on a higher priced garment, they buy a cheaper duplicate from a mass producer. In this sense, the Council of Fashion Designers of American argues that their members customers are being stolen by the cheaper knock offs producers.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{the classic}} model of {{balanced}} affect proposed by Bradburn (The structure of psychological well-being, Aldine, Chicago, IL, 1969), this study conceptualised poor work-related psychological health in terms of high levels of negative affect {{in the absence of}} acceptable levels of positive affect. In order to illuminate self-perceptions of work-related psychological health among a well-defined group of clergy, a random sample of 58 ministers of word and sacrament serving within the west midlands synod of the United Reformed Church in England completed an open-ended questionnaire concerned with the following six guiding questions. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> enjoy your work? How would <b>you</b> <b>define</b> stress? How would <b>you</b> <b>define</b> burnout? What stresses are there in your ministry? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to keep healthy? What can the church do to enhance the work-related psychological health of ministers? Content analysis highlighted the main themes recurring through these open-ended responses. The conclusion is drawn that ministers of word and sacrament within the United Reformed Church in England are exposed to a number of recurrent recognisable sources of stress.
