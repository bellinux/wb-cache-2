To {{evaluate}} 10 biomarkers in {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (M RI) -determined, pre-radiographically defined osteoarthritis (pre-ROA) and radiographically defined OA (ROA) in a population-based cohort of subjects with symptomatic knee pain. Methods. Two hundred one white subjects with knee pain, ages 40 - 79 years, were classified into OA subgroups according to MRI-based cartilage (MRC) scores (range 0 - 4) and Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades of radiographic severity (range 0 - 4) : no OA (MRC score 0, K/L grade 1, K/L grade = 1, K/L grade >= 2). Urine and serum samples were assessed for levels of the following biomarkers: urinary biomarkers C-telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II), type II and types I and II collagen cleavage neoepitopes (<b>uC</b> 2 <b>C</b> and <b>uC</b> 1, 2 <b>C,</b> respectively), and N-telopeptide of type I collagen, and serum biomarkers sC 1, 2 C, sC 2 C, C-propeptide of type II procollagen (sCPII), chondroitin sulfate 846 epitope, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and hyaluronic acid. Multicategory logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of OA subgroup with individual biomarker levels and biomarker ratios, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. Results. The risk of ROA versus no OA increased with increasing levels of uCTX-II (odds ratio [OR] 3. 12, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 35 - 7. 21), <b>uC</b> 2 <b>C</b> (OR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 4. 37), and <b>uC</b> 1, 2 <b>C</b> (OR 2. 07, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 4. 04), and was reduced in association {{with high levels of}} sCPII (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 30 - 0. 94). The risk of pre-ROA versus no OA increased with increasing levels of <b>uC</b> 2 <b>C</b> (OR 2. 06, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 4. 01) and <b>uC</b> 1, 2 <b>C</b> (OR 2. 06, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 3. 77). The ratios of type II collagen degradation markers to collagen synthesis markers were better than individual biomarkers at differentiating the OA subgroups, e. g., the ratio of [uCTX-II] [uC 1, 2 C] to sCPII was associated with a risk of ROA versus no OA of 3. 47 (95 % CI 1. 34 - 9. 03) and a risk of pre-ROA versus no OA of 2. 56 (95 % CI 1. 03 - 6. 40). Conclusion. Different cartilage degradation markers are associated with pre-ROA than are associated with ROA, indicating that their use as diagnostic markers depends on the stage of OA.

We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to examine the neural activation associated with individual differences in the impact of perceived controllability on self-reported pain perception.

Conversely, subjects with greater activation in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in anticipation of pain in the <b>UC</b> versus <b>C</b> conditions reported less pain in response to <b>UC</b> versus <b>C</b> pain.

A regression model containing the two prefrontal clusters (VLPFC and pACC) predicted 64 % of the variance in pain rating difference, with activation in the two additional regions (PAG and insula/SII) predicting almost no additional variance. In addition to supporting the conclusion that the impact of perceived controllability on pain perception varies highly between individuals, these findings suggest that these effects are primarily top-down, driven by processes in regions of the prefrontal cortex previously associated with cognitive modulation of pain and emotion regulation...|$|R

METHODS: BALB/c mice were administered 100 mg/kg AL powder orally each day. After 7 d, colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (5 % W/V) {{in drinking water}} for a further 8 consecutive days. Diarrhea and bloody stools as well as colonic histology were observed. The level of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in colonic sections were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were significant differences in mean body weight values and disease activity indices between controls and AL-treated animals. Moreover, the histological findings showed that AL treatment can prevent mucosal edema, submucosal erosions, ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration and colon damage. In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL- 6 and TNF-alpha were also decreased in AL-treated groups. CONCLUSION: We suggest that AL can prevent intestinal damage and decrease inflammatory cytokines in mice with DSS-induced colitis.

40|$|Background and aims: Infliximab is {{currently}} the only biologic approved for treatment of adults with moderate to severe, active ulcerative colitis (UC) unresponsive to conventional therapies. It rapidly controls symptoms, induces and sustains steroid-free remission, stimulates mucosal healing, and reduces serious complications. Although infliximab tends to be reserved for patients with severe disease, it {{may be even more}} beneficial for moderate disease earlier in the disease course. Therefore, it is important to identify which patients are candidates for infliximab therapy. Methods: A collaborative Delphi survey was used to obtain consensus on use of biologic therapy in patients with UC from an expert panel of 12 gastroenterologists with substantial experience using infliximab in clinical practice and clinical trials. The panel also addressed issues that influence the use of infliximab in UC, including its potential as an alternative to surgery. Results: The panel agreed that: (1) it is necessary to adopt additional treatment goals beyond symptom control, i. e., complete mucosal healing, steroid-free remission, improved QoL, and reduced long-term complications; (2) {{it may be possible to}} achieve these treatment goals with infliximab, especially if it is used earlier in the course of UC; and (3) infliximab should be offered as an alternative to surgery in patients being considered for colectomy. The panel also agreed on factors for identifying candidates for infliximab therapy (e. g., persistently active UC, steroid-dependent/refractory disease, and high C-reactive protein).

GS 1 and GS 2 specific polymorphisms in 23 S rRNA gene were identified by comparison of the 23 S rRNA genes of 49 C. concisus strains. Two newly designed PCR methods, based on the polymorphisms of 23 S rRNA gene, were developed and validated. These PCR methods were used to detect and quantify GS 1 and GS 2 C. concisus in 56 oral and enteric samples collected from the gastrointestinal tract of patients with IBD and healthy controls. Meta-analysis of the composition of the isolated GS 1 and GS 2 C. concisus strains in previous studies was also conducted. The quantitative PCR methods revealed that there was more GS 2 than GS 1 C. concisus in samples collected from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract of both patients with IBD and healthy controls, showing that GS 2 C. concisus is better adapted to the human gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of GS 1 and GS 2 composition of isolated C. concisus strains in previous studies showed similar findings except that in healthy individuals a significantly lower GS 2 than GS 1 C. concisus strains were isolated from fecal samples, suggesting a potential difference in the C. concisus strains or the enteric environment between patients with gastrointestinal diseases and healthy controls.

40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are {{diseases}} {{affecting the}} gastrointestinal tract.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a zero-order sustained-release tablet containing both the anti-inflammatory drugs mesalazine and budesonide as a new treatment option for ileo-colonic CD and UC. Tablets were attained by wet granulation with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and direct compression. Our newly developed tablet core was coated with different ColoPulse (R) coating thicknesses and the mesalazine and budesonide release profiles were investigated in a 600 -min gastrointestinal simulation system (GISS) experiment, together with commercially available MMX (R) -mesalazine and MMX (R) -budesonide. Lag-time, release rate (k(0)), completeness of release, and zero-order correlation coefficient (R- 0 (2)) could be manipulated by varying ColoPulse (R) coating thickness. Our newly developed combination preparation (C[4. 92]) complied with all conducted European Pharmacopoeia tests as well as an accelerated 6 -month stability test and had a lag-time of 250 min (simulated ileum targeted), a linear release profile (mesalazine R- 0 (2) = 0. 9002; budesonide R- 0 (2) = 0. 9481), and drug release of 100 % mesalazine and 77 % budesonide. Like C[4. 92], MMX (R) -mesalazine had a linear (R- 0 (2) = 0. 9883) and complete release profile (96 %). However, C[4. 92] lag-time was longer (250 vs. 210 min), assuring simulated ileum specificity. Remarkably, MMX (R) -budesonide lag-time was 480 min and release was only 7 % with a linear character (R- 0 (2) = 0. 9906). The in vitro results suggest that MMX (R) -budesonide effectiveness may be improved if budesonide release in the aqueous phase would be increased and that C[4. 92] is a potential, new treatment option for ileo-colonic CD and <b>UC.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2016 Elsevier B.

Omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to increase lipid peroxidation, while the omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid exerts a chemopreventative effect. We evaluated the effect of high-fat diets (20 %) enriched with fish or soybean oil on colonic inflammation and DNA damage in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Methods: Male Wistar rats (28 - 30 days) were fed an American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) - 93 diet for 47 days and divided into five groups: control normal fat non-colitic (C) or control colitis (CC), high soybean fat group (HS) colitis, high fish fat group colitis, or high-fat soybean plus fish oil colitis. UC was induced from day 35 until day 41 by 3 % dextran sulfate sodium. On day 47, the rats were anesthetized; blood samples collected for corticosterone determination, and the distal colon was excised to quantify interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 10, and interferon-gamma levels, myeloperoxidase activity, histological analyses, and DNA damage. the disease activity index was recorded daily. Results: the disease activity index, histological analysis, myeloperoxidase activity, IL- 4, interferon-gamma, and corticosterone levels did not differ among the colitic groups. IL- 10 was significantly increased by the high fish fat group diet in relation to HS, but only the high soybean-fish fat diet increased the IL- 10 /IL- 4 ratio (anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory) to levels closer to the C group and reduced DNA damage compared to the HS group (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: the data show that high-fat diets did not exacerbate UC and suggest that the soybean and fish oil mixture, more than the fish oil alone, could be a complementary therapy to achieve a cytokine balance in <b>UC.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|We {{consider}} the twisting of Hopf structure for classical enveloping algebra U(ˆg), where ˆg is the inhomogenous rotations algebra, with explicite formulae given for D = 4 Poincaré algebra (ˆg = P 4). The comultiplications of twisted U F (P 4) are obtained by conjugating primitive classical coproducts by F ∈ <b>U(ĉ)</b> ⊗U(ĉ), where <b>ĉ</b> denotes any Abelian subalgebra of P 4, and the universal R−matrices for U F (P 4) are triangular. As an example {{we show that}} the quantum deformation of Poincaré algebra recently proposed by Chaichian and Demiczev is a twisted classical Poincaré algebra. The interpretation of twisted Poincaré algebra as describing relativistic symmetries with clustered 2 -particle states is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Penetration of Crotalaria juncea (PI 207657 and cv. Tropic Sun) Dolichos lablab cv. Highworth, and Sesamum indicum by juveniles (J 2) of Meloidogyne javanica was {{assessed}} {{to investigate the}} mechanism by which these plants may reduce nematode numbers in the field. Growth chamber experiments were conducted at 25 C, with vials containing 90 g sand infested with 450 J 2; tomato (<b>UC</b> 204 <b>C)</b> was included as a susceptible host. Fifteen days after inoculation, roots were stained and the nematodes within stained roots were counted. Both C. juncea lines were highly resistant to penetration, as they contained significantly fewer nematodes per cm of root and per root system than the other plants. Although containing more nematodes per cm of root than C. juncea, S. indicum and D. lablab had significantly fewer nematodes per root system and per cm of root than tomato. Roots were significantly longer in the plants with the lowest nematode penetration. Although C. juncea, D. lablab, and S. indicum may have potential utility as cover or rotation crops in soil infested with M. javanica, further quantitative information on the reproduction of M. javanica and other nematodes in these plants is needed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to study the {{behavior}} of subsequences <b>uc</b> = {u(⌊n <b>c</b> ⌋) : n ∈ N} of automatic sequences u that are indexed by [n c] for some c> 1. In particular we show that the densities of the letters of uc are precisely the same as those of the original sequence (provided that c < 7 / 5). In this sense uc and u behave in the same way. However, the pair correlation might be completely different as we will show in the special case of the Thue-Morse sequence. The proofs use exponential sum estimates like the double large sieve and a discrete Fourier analysis related to automatic sequences. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
40|$|This {{appendix}} provides and proves {{some technical}} results underlying subsections 5. 3 and 5. 5 in Cukierman (2005) article {{and should be}} {{read in conjunction with}} that paper. 1 The case <b>u(C)</b> +v(l) = <b>C</b> 1 −γ 1 −γ + ql The discussion in this section underlies subsection 5. 3 in Cukierman (2005). Here u(C) is a CRRA in consumption and γ and q are positive parameters. This is a convenient case since its equilibrium can be obtained explicitly from the first order conditions for an internal maximization of utility by the representative individual. It is shown in subsection 5. 2 of Cukierman (2005) that the equilibrium values of consumption and leisure under flexible (FPE) and under sticky prices and wages (SPE) are given respectively b...|$|R
