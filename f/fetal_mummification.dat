While most {{often seen in}} multiparous and polytocous species like swine, it is also observed in monotocous species when the fetus is retained for a long time. The low prevalence of the condition may help explain the scarcity of information in the literature. To further complicate the study of this phenomenon, the physiological mechanisms that maintain pregnancy vary between species, implying different pathways for the condition. The exact outcome of early fetal mortality is unpredictable, and is influenced by several factors, including the cause of fetal mortality, differences in pregnancy between species, stage of gestation at fetal death, and number of fetuses. Based on our current knowledge of natural <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> events, {{there are a number}} of prerequisites for the process of <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> to occur. Examining the circumstances associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> can help scientists better understand the etiology and clinical situation in different species. The objective of this article is to review <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> in the major domestic species: cattle, goats, sheep, horses, swine, dogs, and cats. This paper discusses the clinical situation, the most common and important etiologies, and the treatment approaches for restoring future pregnancy in the female, and where applicable, herd fertility.

40|$|In {{the current}} report {{we present a}} case of the mummification of fetuses in a five year-old German {{shepherd}} dog that was presented with complaint of abdominal enlargement and vaginal discharges. Case history revealed that estradiol benzoate was administered to the dog in an attempt to terminate the unwanted mating that occurred 5 months earlier. Ultrasonographic examination revealed death of the fetuses and accumulation of hypoechoeic fluid in both uterine horns. Ovariohysterectomy was performed on the dog. After the surgery, two mummified fetuses of different sizes and exhibiting different degrees of mummification were detected. This condition is likely {{due to the fact that}} the two fetuses died at different stages of the gestation. After the surgery, vaginal discharges ceased and postoperatively by the 10 th day, the dog was observed to be clinically normal. Our case reveals that although <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> is a rare condition in dogs, it should be considered for differential diagnosis during treatment of conditions that show abdominal enlargement. The aim of this case report is to describe a successful diagnosis and treatment of canine <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> in which the fetuses were of different sizes and exhibiting different degrees of <b>fetal</b> <b>mummification</b> coupled with a large amount of fluid accumulation (13 kg) in the uterus of a dog...|$|E

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely studied parasites due to its medical and {{veterinary}} importance. The parasitic infection of sheep occurs worldwide, with studies showing prevalences ranging from 1. 8 % in North Tunisian to 95. 7 % in Turkey. In this ruminant species, infection with T. gondii causes <b>fetal</b> death, <b>mummification,</b> stillbirth, the birth of debilitated animals and frequent abortion. The latter has been reported as the primary cause of economic losses in the sheep industry because of the high rates of infection. Concerns over toxoplasmosis infections in sheep, as well as the economic losses they can cause, induced this literature review. A review of the topic will provide the reader with some basic information concerning the importance of this parasite in the sheep industry in Brazil and worldwide, which might assist in controlling the disease and promptly identifying the problem in a flock, thus avoiding losses from potential abortions caused by this important parasite. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the genetic variability of Porcine parvovirus (PPV), the complete capsid protein sequences (VP 1 /VP 2) from seven recent field isolates from Germany, one isolate from the UK and one German vaccine strain were sequenced and analysed, along with two American (NADL- 2 and Kresse), three Asian and 22 Brazilian partial PPV sequences retrieved from GenBank. The analysis revealed {{a high degree of}} diversity: 1 ? 2 – 2 ? 6 % at the nucleotide level and 1 ? 2 – 6 ? 8 % at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis defined two German clusters: one formed by four German isolates and the English, Asian and American sequences; and the second, distinct cluster formed by the other three of the seven German isolates examined. The latter cluster was still observed when the 22 partial sequences (853 nt of the 39 terminus of the VP 2 gene) from the Brazilian isolates were included in the analyses, indicating that the VP 2 sequence determines the phylogeny. Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is an important cause of repro-ductive failure in swine, characterized by <b>fetal</b> death, <b>mummification,</b> stillbirths and delayed return to oestrus (Mengeling, 1999).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Goats are {{considered}} very susceptible to infection by Toxoplasma gondii {{and when this}} occurs during pregnancy, it may cause fetal death with subsequent <b>fetal</b> resorption, abortion, <b>mummification,</b> stillborn or the birth of weak goats. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} occurrence of and identify risk factors for T. gondii infection in goats in different mesoregions in the State of Alagoas. METHODS: The research was conducted on 24 goat breeding farms in 10 municipalities. A total of 454 blood samples were examined for anti-T. gondii antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test. To evaluate the risk factors of toxoplasmosis in goats, questionnaires were applied analyzing the farm's production system and nutritional, reproductive and sanitary management. RESULTS: Disease occurrence was 39 % with 95. 8 % of farms presenting seropositive animals. Significant associations were observed for mesoregion (OR = 0. 23; 95 %CI = 0. 09 - 0. 57), age (OR = 0. 36; 95 %CI = 0. 20 - 0. 64), semi-intensive herd management (OR = 8. 70; 95 %CI = 1. 87 - 40. 43), access of cats to water provided for goats (OR = 3. 38; 95 %CI = 1. 89 - 6. 02) and cats feeding on placental remnants (OR = 2. 73; 95 %CI = 1. 38 - 5. 40). CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma gondii infection is disseminated in the State of Alagoas and the adoption of a program that monitors infection foci is required to reduce the risk factors identified in the present study...|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{parvovirus}} (PPV) {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important causes of reproductive failure in swine. <b>Fetal</b> death, <b>mummification,</b> stillbirths and delayed return to estrus are some of the clinical signs commonly associated with PPV infection in a herd. The virus genome {{is considered to}} be conservative, with substitution rates near to that of their host. However, it has been shown that some parvoviruses exhibit a substitution rate close to that commonly determined for RNA viruses. In this scenario, new PPV phenotypes may reduce the effectiveness of the currently used vaccines, recommending the continuous monitoring of the currently prevalent PPV strains. In addition, a number of novel porcine parvoviruses have been described during the last decade, but the importance and characteristics of these viruses remain unknown. In the present dissertation, three studies were performed to address the PPV genetic variability, to monitor the emergence of new PPV strains and the prevalence of novel parvoviruses. In the first study, recent PPV field isolates from Austria, Brazil, Germany and Switzerland were sequenced and analyzed. These samples, together with sequences retrieved from GenBank, were included in three datasets (viral protein complete gene, viral protein partial gene and non-structural protein complete gene). For each dataset, the nucleotide substitution rate was determined and a molecular clock estimated. The analysis revealed that for the new strains, the amino acids substitutions were located mainly in the viral capsid loops. Only the capsid protein datasets present the higher suitability for phylogenetic analysis. In them, a higher divergence was found, with three well defined clusters. By inferring the evolutionary dynamics of the PPV sequences, a nucleotide substitution rate of approximately 10 - 4 substitutions per site per year was found for these datasets. An association of the phylogenetic tree with the molecular clock revealed that the main divergence of the PPV strains for the viral protein ocurred in the last 30 years. In the second study, the population dynamic of PPV isolates from swine herds was analyzed using PPV complete protein gene and partial sequences deposited in GenBank. The population dynamic of the virus was calculated using a Bayesian approach with a Bayesian skyline coalescent model. Additionally, an in vitro model was performed by twenty-one consecutives passages of the Challenge strain (a virulent field strain) and NADL 2 strain (a vaccine strain) in PK 15 cell-line supplemented with polyclonal antibodies raised against the vaccine strain (negative control was not supplemented). The Bayesian analysis indicated a decrease in the population diversity over the years and the predominance of some PPV strains. In agreement, the in vitro study revealed that a lower number of mutations appeared for both viruses in the presence of anti-PPV antibodies in comparison with the control passages without antibodies. In the third study, tonsils and hearts from 100 pigs were collected in a German slaughterhouse in 2010 and tested for PPV, porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV 2), porcine parvovirus 3 (PPV 3) and porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV 4). Positive samples of PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 were sequenced. PPV was observed in 60 / 100 hearts and 61 / 100 tonsils and PPV 2 in 55 / 100 hearts and 78 / 100 tonsils. PPV 3 and PPV 4 could not be detected in the heart samples but 20 / 100 and 7 / 100, respectively, of the tonsils were tested positive. The phylogenetic analysis of the PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 sequences revealed that the German samples could be divided in at least two clusters or clades for each virus. Altogether, it can be concluded that PPV is continuously evolving. Apparently, PPV vaccines largely used in the last 30 years probably have reduced the genetic diversity of the virus and induced the predominance of strains with distinct capsid profile from the original vaccine-based strain. Moreover, the high prevalence of the PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 and their genetic diversity highlight the importance of the continuous monitoring of these viruses...|$|R
