Intensive immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab appears to be effective as salvage therapy, and ongoing clinical trials should determine whether adjuvant rituximab with plasma exchange also is beneficial at first diagnosis.

40|$|Severe ADAMTS 13 {{deficiency}} is {{a critical}} component of the pathogenesis of <b>idiopathic</b> thrombotic <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> but is found only in about 60 % of patients clinically diagnosed with this disease. Over a period of 8 years and six episodes of thrombotic <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> we studied the evolution of the anti-ADAMTS 13 antibody response in a patient using different ADAMTS 13 assays and epitope mapping. Anti-ADAMTS 13 autoantibodies were found in all episodes but were inhibitory only in the last two episodes. In a flow-based assay, normal ADAMTS 13 activity was found only during the first disease episode, while ADAMTS 13 activity was normal using a static assay in episodes 1 and 3, and severely deficient in the last two episodes. Fluorescence evolution in a modified fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay using a von Willebrand factor A 2 domain peptide substrate was linear in episodes 1, 5 and 6, but increased exponentially in episodes 3 and 4. Despite the variable functional characteristics of the anti-ADAMTS 13 autoantibodies, their principal epitope was the ADAMTS 13 spacer domain in all episodes.

40|$|Louise ProfitCore Medical Publishing, Knutsford, UKIntroduction: <b>Idiopathic</b> (immune) <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> (ITP) is an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{characterized by}} low platelet counts and bleeding episodes. Current therapy options {{are associated with}} unwanted side effects, and although patients initially respond to treatment the platelet count is not sustained in many individuals. There {{is a need for}} safe and well-tolerated treatments that provide a sustained platelet response. Aims: This review summarizes the emerging evidence for the potential use of eltrombopag in the treatment of ITP in adults. Disease and treatment: Eltrombopag is a nonpeptide, small molecular weight thrombopoietin receptor agonist that is orally administered. It mimics the activity of thrombopoietin, a cytokine that promotes growth and production of platelets, primarily inducing proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells. Profile: Eltrombopag is still {{in the early stages of}} development but initial phase I and phase II results are promising. Potential advantages of eltrombopag may include a sustained platelet response and a good tolerability profile. Its once-daily oral dosing regimen would also be an advantage over many of the existing therapies. It is expected that patients who have failed first-line therapy with corticosteroids and wish to avoid the need for a splenectomy, and patients with chronic refractory ITP, may benefit from eltrombopag treatment.

40|$|Background: The {{autoimmune}} disease known as <b>Idiopathic</b> (immune <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> (ITP) is clinically {{defined by a}} low numbers of platelets in the circulation blood. This study aimed to isolate autoantibodies made against the platelet glycoproteins using platelets from healthy volunteers, to determine their specificity and further elucidate their effects on platelet function. Methods: This study used a phage display system to recognize Fab anti-platelet antibodies. Anti-platelet After isolation, the anti-platelet Fab-expressing phage was characterized by ELISA and Western blotting. The Fab-bearing phage pool obtained from five rounds of panning was analysed {{in order to determine}} its anti-platelet reactivity. Of the phage colonies obtained, 100 colonies of different sizes were randomly selected for reaction with whole platelets, using M 13 phage as a negative control. Results: Twelve colonies of them had strong reactions against the whole platelet preparation, but only four colonies showed substantial reactivity against the lysed platelet preparation (lysate). Three of the four colonies showed three bands representing proteins with different molecular weights. The fourth colony showed only a single band. The final experiment to characterise the protein isolated from the phage library was a DNA gel agarose test. Conclusion: Each colony showed a DNA band that corresponded with the molecular size marker for 5. 4 kbase pairs, and this suggested the presence of heavy and light antibody chains in the phage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> (immune) <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> (ITP) is {{a common}} {{autoimmune}} disorder resulting in isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP can present either alone (primary) or {{in the setting of}} other conditions (secondary) such as infections or altered immune states. ITP is associated with a loss of tolerance to platelet antigens and a phenotype of accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Although the etiology of ITP remains unknown, complex dysregulation of the immune system is observed in ITP patients. Antiplatelet antibodies mediate accel-erated clearance from the circulation in large part via the reticuloendothelial (monocytic phagocytic) system. In addition, cellular immunity is perturbed and T-cell and cytokine profiles are significantly shifted toward a type 1 and Th 17 proinflammatory immune response. Further clues into immune dysregulation in ITP may be gleaned from studies of secondary ITP. Some infections can induce antiplatelet Abs by molecular mimicry, and there may be common elements involved in breaking tolerance with other autoimmune disorders. There is also evidence for a genetic predisposition to both ITP and responsiveness to therapy, which may in part lie within immune-related genes. Lastly, treatment with immunomodulatory agents remains the mainstay of ITP therapies...|$|R

Nineteen patients with idiopathic TTP were enrolled on prospective studies at Ohio State University between September 2003 and May 2007. Patients achieving remission remained on CSA therapy for 6 months, allowing us to evaluate the efficacy of CSA as prophylactic therapy. CSA was administered orally at a dose of 2 – 3 mg/kg in a twice a day divided dose in all patients and continued for a total of 6 months.

METHODS: The diagnosis of TTP was based on clinical criteria and supported by severe deficiency of ADAMTS 13 activity and presence of inhibitors in seven cases. Rituximab was started after a median of 18. 6 sessions of PE (range: 5 – 35) at the dose of 375  mg/m 2 /week for 4 – 8  weeks.
