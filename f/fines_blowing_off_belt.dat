50|$|When {{droughts}} {{occur in}} Afghanistan, or {{the water in}} watersheds that support Lake Hāmūn is drawn down by other natural or human-induced reasons, {{the end result is}} a dry lake bed in Iran. In addition, when the lake is dry, seasonal winds <b>blow</b> <b>fine</b> sands <b>off</b> the exposed lake bed. The sand is swirled into huge dunes that may cover a hundred or more fishing villages along the former lake shore. Wildlife around the lake is negatively impacted and fisheries are brought to a halt. Changes in water policies and substantial rains in the region hope to effect a return of much of the water in Lake Hamoun by 2003.|$|R
