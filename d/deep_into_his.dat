500|$|The Revd Islwyn Jones, who {{conducted}} Davies's funeral service, said: [...] "He {{had a great}} love for man, he believed with the Psalmist that 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof', and it was these words, sinking <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heart, which made him 'take up the cudgels for the common man' [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In 698/9, the Umayyad {{governor}} of Sistan, Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Bakra, suffered a severe defeat by the semi-independent ruler of Zabulistan, {{known as the}} Zunbīl. The Zunbīl drew the Arabs <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> country and cut them off, so that they managed to extricate themselves only with great difficulty and after suffering many losses, particularly among the Kufan contingent. In response, al-Hajjaj sent an Iraqi army to the east against the Zunbīl. Whether due to the splendour of its equipment or as an allusion to the [...] "proud and haughty manner of the Kufan soldiers and ashrāf who composed it" [...] (G. R. Hawting), this army became known in history as the [...] "Peacock Army". Two different generals were appointed by al-Hajjaj in succession to command it, before he appointed Ibn al-Ash'ath instead. In view of their bad relations, the sources report, the appointment {{came as a surprise}} to many; an uncle of Ibn al-Ash'ath even approached al-Hajjaj and suggested that his nephew might revolt, but al-Hajjaj did not rescind his appointment. Al-Tabari suggests that al-Hajjaj relied on the fear he inspired to keep Ibn al-Ash'ath in check; modern scholarship on the other hand holds that the portrayal of the great personal animosity between the two men is likely to be exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|During his sabbatical, Madhavan {{also worked}} {{extensively}} on the pre-production of the bilingual sports film, Irudhi Suttru (2016) directed by Sudha Kongara. After being impressed with Sudha's script, he helped find the project producers in Tamil and chose to produce the film in Hindi alongside Sashikanth and Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan also met and convinced mixed martial artist Ritika Singh {{to act in the}} film after contacting her through Raj Kundra, while he was also credited for contributing as an additional screenplay writer. He also went through a body conditioning regime in Los Angeles prior to joining the film's set and learnt boxing to essay the role of a former boxer. For dubbing purposes, Madhavan wore metal braces inside his teeth, in order to create the effect of having a lisp that most boxers have from sporting injuries. Madhavan won praise for his work during the marketing campaign, having travelled throughout Tamil Nadu to promote the film, with The Hindu stating it was [...] "unlike other film promotions in the South". For Irudhi Suttru, Madhavan received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal with Sify.com stating [...] "he is outstanding and carries the proverbial burden of the project on his shoulder". A critic from The Hindu stated that he was [...] "quietly effective", while a reviewer from Behindwoods.com wrote that Madhavan gives his [...] "best performance" [...] and is [...] "excellent" [...] at depicting his [...] "characterization from being subtle to being outright effervescent". His portrayal in the Hindi version, Saala Khadoos, received similar praise with critic Subhash K. Jha stating [...] "this is Madhavan’s career-defining performance, he sinks so <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> role both physically and emotionally, that the actor becomes one with the act".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> character, he really lived it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schumacher {{replaced}} Tim Burton as {{the director}} of the Batman film franchise when he directed Batman Forever in 1995. Val Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton in the title role. At the time, Schumacher attempted to cast Corey Haim as Robin, however Haim was too <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> drug addiction to even give a full audition, so Chris O'Donnell got the part. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, the film scored the highest-grossing opening weekend of 1995. It finished as the second highest-grossing film of the year in North America, and sixth-highest worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Bad Brains {{signed with}} SST Records and {{released}} I Against I, which, {{in addition to}} their hardcore punk and reggae sounds, introduced a heavy metal/funk hybrid sound. H.R. provided the vocals for [...] "Sacred Love" [...] over the phone from the Lorton Reformatory while doing a bid for a cannabis charge. Also critically praised was H.R.'s performance: Rick Anderson wrote on AllMusic that, [...] " [...] digs <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bag of voices and pulls them all out, one by one: the frightening nasal falsetto that was his signature in the band's hardcore days, an almost bel canto baritone, and a declamatory speed-rap chatter that spews lyrics with the mechanical precision of a machine gun". The title track's video was shown on MTV's then-new 120 Minutes program, for which the band appeared in promotional footage.|$|E
2500|$|John Gregory Bourke's {{memoir of}} his {{service in the}} Indian wars, On the Border with Crook, {{describes}} a different account of Crazy Horse's death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E
