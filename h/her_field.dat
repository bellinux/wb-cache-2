5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside <b>her</b> <b>field</b> of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies.

25|$|The afterlife is {{a complex}} matter in Norse mythology. The dead may go to the murky realm of Hel—a realm ruled over by a female being of the same name, may be ferried away by valkyries to Odin's martial hall Valhalla, or may be chosen by the goddess Freyja to dwell in <b>her</b> <b>field</b> Fólkvangr. The goddess Rán may claim those that die at sea, and the goddess Gefjon {{is said to be}} {{attended}} by virgins upon their death. Texts also make reference to reincarnation.
