40|$|Cadmium, a {{carcinogenic}} metal, {{is highly}} toxic to renal, skeletal, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Accurate and precise quantification of mainstream smoke cadmium levels in cigarette smoke {{is important because}} of exposure concerns. The two most common trapping techniques for collecting mainstream tobacco smoke particulate for analysis are glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> and electrostatic precipitators. We observed that {{a significant portion of}} total cadmium passed through standard glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> that are used to trap particulate matter. We therefore developed platinum traps to collect the cadmium that passed through the filters and tested a variety of cigarettes with different physical parameters for quantities of cadmium that passed though the filters. We found < 1 % cadmium passed through electrostatic precipitators. In contrast, cadmium that passed through 92 mm glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> on a rotary smoking machine was significantly higher, ranging from 3. 5 to 22. 9 % of total smoke cadmium deliveries. Cadmium passed through 44 mm filters typically used on linear smoking machines to an even greater degree, ranging from 13. 6 to 30. 4 % of the total smoke cadmium deliveries. Differences in the cadmium that passed through from the glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> and electrostatic precipitator could be explained in part if cadmium resides in the smaller mainstream smoke aerosol particle sizes. Differences in particle size distribution could have toxicological implications and could help explain the pulmonary and cardiovascular cadmium uptake in smokers.

40|$|The {{partitioning}} of photosynthetically-derived {{organic carbon}} between particulate and dissolved phases {{has important implications}} for marine carbon cycling. In this study we utilized 14 C-bicarbonate assimilation to quantify rates of photosynthetic production of both particulate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at Station ALOHA (22 ˚ 45 ’N, 158 ˚W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). At near-monthly time scales over ~ 5 years, we examined retention of 14 C-labeled organic matter by both glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> and 0. 2 µm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters that are commonly used for measurements of 14 C-based plankton productivity. Use of polycarbonate filters resulted in significantly lower (averaging 60 %) estimates of 14 C-production compared to glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters.</b> Coincident measurements of chlorophyll a concentrations from both 0. 2 µm polycarbonate and glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters</b> were not significantly different, suggesting the differences in 14 C-productivity between these filter-types did not derive from differences in retention of photosynthetic biomass by these filters. Moreover, consistent with previous studies, results from experiments aimed at quantifying retention of organic matter by these filters suggested the difference between these two types of filters resulted from retention of DOC by glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filters.</b> We also quantified rates of 14 C-DOC production to evaluate the partitioning of photosynthetic production between dissolved and particulate phases over daily to monthly time scales in this ecosystem. Unlike the strong depth-dependence observed in measurements of particulate organic carbon production, measured rates of 14 C-DOC demonstrated no clear depth-dependence. On average, depth-integrated (0 - 75 m) rates of 14 C-DOC production rates were equivalent to 18 ± 10 % of the total (particulate and dissolved) productivity. Our findings indicate that in this oligotrophic ecosystem, rates of dissolved and particulate production can be temporally decoupled over daily to monthly time scales...|$|R

Pollutants in {{rainwater}} often {{cause problems}} such as non-point source pollutant and deterioration of collected water quality in rainwater harvesting systems. <b>Fiber</b> <b>filter</b> media {{have been developed to}} resolve these problems by removing pollutants in rainwater by filtration and ion-exchange mechanisms. They have been also successfully applied for the treatment of first-flush rainwater. However, little information is available on the long-term efficiency and the lifetime of the <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> media. In this study, new and used <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> media were compared in terms of their filterability and ion-exchange capability. The used filter media samples were taken from a first flush filter in a rainwater harvesting system located in an elementary school in Kyonggi-Do. They were used from 2005 to 2010 without any replacement or cleaning. Water quality parameters of an inflow and outflow in the first flush filter were analyzed to quantify the on-site treatment efficiency of the used media. It was shown that the turbidity was removed by approximately 60 % and COD was partly removed. The removal efficiency of particles by the used media was similar to that by the new media. Nevertheless, the removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorous by the used media were substantially reduced when compared with the new media. This suggests that the <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> media should be periodically replaced to maintain high removals of nutrients. On the other hand, they can be used for more than 6 years if their primary purpose is to removal particles...|$|E

In the case of a flock impacting surface and in that of a glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> impacting surface, the 50 % cut-off radius value for a double impactor with 4 mm orifice opening, at a q = 90 m 3 /h average volume flow was r 50 % = 1 µm, while for a teflon impacting surface it was r 50 % = 2. 3 µm. The E(r) impacting efficiency curve was steepest in case of applying the flock impacting surface, it was less steep in case of an undulated teflon one. The separation of the average background aerosol for coarse and fine grade domains was well performed both by flock and glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> impacting surfaces. It is of special significance that the glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> impacting surface and the undulated teflon impacting surface are excellent for so-called gravimetric chemical analysis. When applying flock or glass <b>fiber</b> <b>filter</b> surfaces, about 8 - 10 % of the winter-time fine grade penetration derived from the coarse grade domain, while the respective summer parameters were between 16 - 23 %. The relative humidity of the air significantly influenced the results of the measurement, as it usually does for any other type of impactor. Consequently, at a relative humidity of 80 % the E(r) curves for all the above three types of impacting surfaces indicated a more favorable separation function.
