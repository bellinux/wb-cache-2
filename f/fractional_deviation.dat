For confident detection of planets in extremely weak central perturbation (EWCP) events, {{it is necessary to}} have both high cadence monitoring and high photometric accuracy better than those of current follow-up observation systems. The next-generation ground-based observation project, KMTNet (Korea Microlensing Telescope Network), satisfies the conditions. We estimate the probability of occurrence of EWCP events with <b>fractional</b> <b>deviations</b> of ≤ 2 % in high-magnification events and the efficiency of detecting planets in the EWCP events using the KMTNet. From this study, we find that the EWCP events occur with a frequency of > 50 % in the case of ≲ 100 M_ E planets with separations of 0. 2 AU≲ d ≲ 20 AU. We find that for main-sequence and subgiant source stars, ≳ 1 M_ E planets in EWCP events with the deviations ≤ 2 % can be detected > 50 % in a certain range that changes with the planet mass. However, it is difficult to detect planets in EWCP events of bright stars like giant stars, because it is easy for KMTNet to be saturated around the peak of the events with a constant exposure time. EWCP events are caused by close, intermediate, and wide planetary systems with low-mass planets and close and wide planetary systems with massive planets. Therefore, we expect that a much greater variety of planetary systems than those already detected, which are mostly intermediate planetary systems regardless of the planet mass, will be significantly detected in the near future.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{detection}} condition of a wide-separation planet through the perturbation {{induced by the}} planetary caustic for various microlensing parameters, especially for {{the size of the}} source stars. By constructing the <b>fractional</b> <b>deviation</b> maps at various positions in the space of microlensing parameters, we find that the pattern of the <b>fractional</b> <b>deviation</b> depends on the ratio of the source radius to the caustic size, and the ratio satisfying the observational threshold varies with the star-planet separation. We have also obtained the upper limits of the source size that allows the detection of the signature of the host star {{as a function of the}} separation for given observational threshold. It is shown that this relation further leads one to a simple analytic condition for the star-planet separation to detect the boundness of wide-separation planets as a function of the mass ratio and the source radius. For example, when 5 % of the detection threshold is assumed, for a source star with the radius of ~ 1 R_sun, an Earth-mass planet and a Jupiter-mass planet can be recognized of its boundness when it is within the separation range of ~ 10 AU and ~ 30 AU, respectively. We also compare the separation ranges of detection by the planetary caustic with those by the central caustic. It is found that when the microlensing light curve caused by the planetary caustic happens to be analyzed, one may afford to support the boundness of the wide-separation planet farther than when that caused by the central caustic is analyzed. Finally, we conclude by briefly discussing the implication of our findings on the next-generation microlensing experiments. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} {{advantage of}} the "Mobius" scheme, or any other strongly coupled lattice, is that the normal-mode oscillations are damped at rates which depend on both the horizontal and vertical chromaticities.

This "chromaticity sharing" has been observed at CESR by introducing resonant coupling with weak skew quadrupoles and observing the coherent damping rates of shock-excited betatron oscillations. 1 INTRODUCTION Chromaticity compensation is required in high-energy storage rings to avoid instability due to the head-tail (H-T) effect [1, 2].
