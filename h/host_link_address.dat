40|$|Abstract-The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a {{computer}} networking protocol for determining a network <b>host's</b> <b>Link</b> Layer <b>address</b> when only its Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address is known. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing is a technique used to attack an Ethernet wired or wireless network. It also known as ARP flooding, ARP poisoning or ARP Poison Routing (APR). ARP Spoofing may allow an attacker to sniff data frames on a local area network (LAN), modify the traffic, or stop the traffic altogether. The principle of ARP spoofing is to send fake, or "spoofed", ARP messages to an Ethernet LAN. In this paper, we present a novel approach that {{is an extension of}} the original ARP that came into existence in 1982, where we feel that if within a network, when a communicating node identifies the correct Media Access Control (MAC) address from a given IP address through request and response mechanism, it is made to store that in a IP/MAC address mapping table for the entire while that machine is alive. By doing this we can put a check to the MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE (MITM) attack for that IP address. The proposed scheme goes further by taking into consideration a probability based voting resolution mechanism for new IP addresses based is backward compatible with existing ARP.

Compatible network types include Ethernet, <b>Host</b> <b>Link,</b> Controller Link, SYSMAC LINK, SYSMAC WAY, and Toolbus. FINS allows communications between nodes up to three network levels. A direct connection between a computer and a PLC via <b>Host</b> <b>Link</b> is not considered a network level.|$|R

The sender can then select its Multi Point Relays (MPR) based on the one hop node which offer the best routes to the two hop nodes. By this way, the amount of control traffic can be reduced. Each node has also an MPR selector set which enumerates nodes that have selected it as an MPR node. OLSR uses TC messages along with MPR forwarding to disseminate neighbor information throughout the network. OLSR checks the symmetry of neighbor nodes {{by means of a}} 4 -way handshake based on HELLO messages. This handshake is inherently used to compute the packetloss probability over a certain link. This can sound odd, because packetloss is generally computed at higher layer than routing one. However, an estimate of the packetloss is needed by OLSR in order to assign a weight or a state to every <b>link.</b> <b>Host</b> Network <b>Address</b> (HNA) messages are used by OLSR to disseminate network route advertisements {{in the same way that}} TC messages advertise host routes.|$|R

RCCs/RCC2s work like LGCs in controlling LCMs. Large remotes may have 2+ RCC/RCCs {{and they can be}} equipped with links between the RCCs - Interlinks; so calls within the remote do not tie up <b>host</b> <b>links.</b> The RCCs/RCC2s are usually equipped so they will provide calling within the remote office if the <b>host</b> <b>links</b> fail; this feature is called ESA; Emergency Stand Alone.|$|R
