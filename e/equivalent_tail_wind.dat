50|$|In April 1996 in El Paso, Texas, Thompson ran the then-fastest 100 m race ever. He was clocked at {{the time}} of 9.69 s.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} equations {{of motion}} with wind shear terms were {{used to analyze the}} stability and motions of a jet transport. A positive wind shear gives a decreasing head wind or changes a head <b>wind</b> into a <b>tail</b> <b>wind.</b> A negative wind shear gives a decreasing <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> or changes a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> into a head wind. It was found that wind shear had very little effect on the short period mode and that negative wind shear, although it affected the phugoid, did not cause stability problems. On the other hand, it was found that positive wind shear can cause the phugoid to become aperiodic and unstable. In this case, a stability boundary for the phugoid was found that is valid for most aircraft at all flight speeds. Calculations of aircraft motions confirmed the results of the stability analysis. It was found that a flight path control automatic pilot and an airspeed control system provide good control in all types of wind shear. Appendixes give {{equations of motion}} that include the effects of downdrafts and updrafts and extend the longitudinal equations of motion for shear to six degrees of freedom...|$|R
50|$|In {{making his}} record jump, Beamon enjoyed {{a number of}} {{advantageous}} environmental factors. At an altitude of 2240 m, Mexico City's air had less resistance than air at sea level, although the rarefied atmosphere in Mexico City {{would have made a}} difference of only approximately 4 cm. Beamon also benefited from a <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> of 2 meters per second on his jump, the maximum allowable for record purposes. It has been estimated that the <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> and altitude may have improved Beamon's long jump distance by 31 cm (12.2 in.). In addition to Beamon's record, world records were broken in most of the sprinting and jumping events at the 1968 Olympic Games.

40|$|Flight {{dynamics}} {{theories are}} influenced by two major topics: how birds adapt their flight to cope with heterogeneous habitats, and whether birds plan to use the wind field or simply experience it. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the flight dynamics of free-flying Cory’s shearwaters in relation to the wind characteristics on the coastal upwelling region of continental Portugal. We deployed recently miniaturised devices—global positioning system loggers to collect precise and detailed information on birds’ positions and motions. Prevalent winds were blowing from the north-east and adults used those winds by adjusting their flight directions mainly towards north-west and south-west, flying with cross and <b>tail</b> <b>winds,</b> respectively, and avoiding head winds. This is confirmation that Cory’s shearwaters use a shear soaring flying strategy while exploiting the environment for food: adults foraged mainly with cross winds and their ground speed was not constant during all foraging trips as it changed dynamically as a result of the ocean surface shear winds. During travelling phases, ground speed was strongly influenced by the position of the bird with regard to the wind direction, as ground speed increased significantly with increasing <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> component (TWC) values. Adults appear to choose foraging directions to exploit ambient wind, in order to improve shear soaring efficiency (cross winding) and exploit diurnal changes in <b>tail</b> <b>wind</b> strength to maximise commuting efficiency. We report, for the first time, precise ground speed values (GPS-derived data) and computed actual flight speed values (using TWC analysis) for Cory’s shearwater...|$|R
50|$|The IAAF {{considers}} marks set at {{high altitude}} as acceptable for record consideration. However, high altitude can significantly assist sprint performances.
