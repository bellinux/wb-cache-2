We apply survival analysis techniques in order to exploit {{the information contained in}} the numerous ”censored ” data (upper limits on fluxes). We find that Seyfert nuclei hosted in early–type galaxies are, on average, characterized by stronger radio core emission than the norm for Seyfert galaxies. Galaxies with a nearby companion display enhanced radio core emission with respect to objects without companions. Furthermore, we confirm that Seyfert types 2 host more powerful compact radio cores than types 1.

Freeze-drying（FD） is a popular method used in the culture preservation of microorganisms. However, it possesses the major defects of lengthy drying time. Controlled low-temperature vacuum drying（CLTVD） is a method to dehydrate products as cold as possible without freezing. Freezing damage could be avoided and high quality products as those produced by FD might be manufactured. Besides, the lengthy drying {{time as well as}} large amount of energy used for freeze drying could be reduced. On the other hand, the FD method traditionally used is also slow and needs high cost. Therefore, competitiveness could be enhanced by means of the improvement of the drying operation, such as reduction in drying time, enhancement of the viability and storage stability after drying, etc. <b>Far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> possesses many advantages, such as high thermal transmission, simple design, easy operation, and low cost, etc., and is frequently used in dehydration operation. Besides, intermittent heating is also often used in far-infrared heating in order to reduce drying time and improve product quality. The objectives of this study are to employ <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating（T = 40 °C；α = 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 ） in the FD and CLTVD of L. acidophilus in order to ameliorate the survival, activity, and storage stability of dried cell cultures. Besides, the effects of different <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating conditions on the fatty acid index changes of the dried cells membrane and intracellular protein composition were investigated. The application of <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> could shorten the most drying time. Results indicated that L. acidophilus had the greatest survival after <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating α = 0. 5 in the CLTVD and <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating α = 0. 25 in the FD. The sensitivity of FD（- 30 °C, α = 0. 25; - 60 °C, α = 0. 5 ） and CLTVD（α = 0. 25 ）with <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating L. acidophilus was lower than without <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating. During storage, L. acidophilus stored at lower temperatures possessed higher survival. The acidification power test demonstrated that better value obtained was CLTVD with <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> in α = 1. 0 and α = 0. 5. In SDS-page analysis, no new intracellular protein was found but different intracellular protein contents were found after in various drying methods. In the fatty acid composition analysis, CLTVD had the lower C 16 ： 0 content content and freezing was increased C 16 ： 0 content. The application of intermittent <b>far-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> heating α = 0. 5 in the CLTVD、α = 0. 25 in the FD will shorten drying time and had the greatest survival. 中文摘要………………………………………………………………i 英文摘要………………………………………………………………iii 壹、前言……………………………………………………………… 1 貳、文獻整理………………………………………………………… 2 一、遠紅外線(far infrared；FIR) ……………………………… 2 (一) 遠紅外線的定義及原理………………………………………… 2 (二) 遠紅外線加熱的特徵…………………………………………… 2 (三) 遠紅外線加熱的優缺點………………………………………… 2 (四) 遠紅外線加熱在食品加工上的應用…………………………… 5 (五) 間歇性遠紅外線加熱的應用…………………………………… 6 二、冷凍乾燥………………………………………………………… 9 (一) 冷凍乾燥定義及原理…………………………………………… 9 (二) 冷凍乾燥的設備………………………………………………… 14 (三) 冷凍乾燥產品的優缺點………………………………………… 14 (四) 乳酸菌的冷凍乾燥 …………………………………………… 18 三、控低溫真空乾燥………………………………………………… 19 (一) 控低溫真空乾燥的原理………………………………………… 19 (二) 控低溫真空乾燥之特點………………………………………… 19 (三) 控低溫真空乾燥之發展性……………………………………… 21 四、乳酸菌的介紹…………………………………………………… 21 (一) 乳酸菌之定義…………………………………………………… 21 (二) 乳酸菌為優質益生菌（probiotics）………………………… 23 (三) 乳酸菌在加工上之利用………………………………………… 31 (四) 嗜酸乳酸桿菌（Lactobacillus acidophilus) ……………… 33 參、研究目的………………………………………………………… 36 肆、材料與方法……………………………………………………… 37 一、試驗材料與儀器………………………………………………… 37 (一) 材料……………………………………………………………… 37 (二) 儀器……………………………………………………………… 41 二、試驗方法………………………………………………………… 41 (一) 實驗菌株的製備………………………………………………… 41 (二) 乾燥實驗………………………………………………………… 44 (三) 菌體存活率測定………………………………………………… 45 (四) 產酸能力試驗…………………………………………………… 45 (五) 蛋白質分析……………………………………………………… 47 (六) 脂肪酸成分分析………………………………………………… 47 (七) 貯藏試驗………………………………………………………… 47 (八) 實驗架構………………………………………………………… 47 (九) 統計分析………………………………………………………… 47 伍、結果與討論……………………………………………………… 53 一、不同乾燥方法所需時間與間歇率的評估……………………… 53 (一) 間歇率對於乾燥水分含量的影響……………………………… 53 (二) 間歇率對於乾燥時間的影響…………………………………… 58 二、不同乾燥方法與間歇率之樣品菌株存活率比較……………… 58 (一) 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥與間歇率對於菌株存活率的影響… 58 (二) 遠紅外線冷凍乾燥與間歇率對於菌株存活率的影響………… 60 三、不同乾燥處理後菌株細胞膜及細胞壁之完整性探討………… 61 (一) 遠紅外線控低溫真空乾燥與間歇率對於菌株敏感度的影響… 62 (二) 遠紅外線冷凍乾燥與間歇率對於菌株敏感度的影響………… 62 四、不同乾燥方法所得樣品的貯藏安定性………………………… 64 (一) 貯藏溫度對不同乾燥方法樣品的影響………………………… 64 (二) 死滅速率k值的探討 …………………………………………… 69 五、不同乾燥方法及間歇率對於菌株產酸能力的影響…………… 73 六、結構分析………………………………………………………… 76 (一) 蛋白質分析……………………………………………………… 77 (二) 脂肪酸組成分析………………………………………………… 81 陸、結論……………………………………………………………… 87 柒、參考文獻………………………………………………………… 8...|$|E
