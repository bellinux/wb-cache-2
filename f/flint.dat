5|$|A bypass of Saginaw was {{completed}} by 1953. This new roadway was designated as US23 alone. The highway through downtown Saginaw was numbered US10/Bus. US23. The Fenton–Clio Expressway {{was completed}} in 1957 from Birch Run past <b>Flint.</b> The new expressway was numbered US23, leaving the former highway through <b>Flint</b> as just US10. A bypass of Reed City opened by 1960; the former routing was renumbered Bus. US10.|$|E
5|$|All of M-21, {{except for}} some {{segments}} just outside Grand Rapids and <b>Flint,</b> along with the highway split into two one-way streets inside <b>Flint,</b> is undivided surface road; none of M-21 is freeway. The section between I-75/US23 and Saginaw Street in <b>Flint</b> {{is part of the}} National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-21, like all state highways, is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along its highways. They use a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. Traffic volumes in 2009 vary from 22,756vehicles in the Forest Hills neighborhood east of Grand Rapids to 1,719vehicles in Pewamo daily. MDOT reported that the peak AADT was 36,053vehicles daily near the I-75 interchange in the <b>Flint</b> area.|$|E
5|$|At Durand, I-69 {{meets the}} southeastern end of M-71 on the {{northwest}} side of town. The freeway turns sharply to the northeast before turning due east near Lennon. The interchange with M-13 south of Lennon marks the Shiawassee–Genesee county line. Continuing eastward, I-69 parallels Miller Road to the north {{as far as the}} city of Swartz Creek; east of town, the two roadways cross. I-69 parallels a line of the Canadian National Railway as it enters the <b>Flint</b> metro area. The freeway intersects Bristol Road near the Bishop International Airport and then crosses I-75/US23 southwest of downtown <b>Flint.</b> I-69, the railroad and the Swartz Creek all parallel into downtown <b>Flint</b> where the freeway intersects I-475 and M-54 (Dort Highway) before exiting {{the east side of the}} city.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of abrasiveness and hardness of rocks have been extensively covered by previous researchers, with {{little attention to}} <b>flints,</b> which were only described as highly abrasive. However, analysis of <b>flints</b> has shown that abrasivity of <b>flints</b> varies. These parameters are important inputs for the prediction of drill bit wear rate and design of various parts of drilling/tunneling/mining equipment. In this paper, a classification of <b>flints</b> (sampled from the English, French and Danish Chalk) which correlates with the abrasivity and hardness of <b>flints</b> is proposed. The results showed lighter/grey <b>flints</b> (with more calcite) have lower potential to cause drill bit wear as indicated by hardness and geotechnical wear indices than dark <b>flints.</b> This tends to suggest that even small variations in the carbonate content results in significant variation in abrasivity and that colour {{can be used as}} an indication of the potential of <b>flints</b> to cause tool wear...|$|R

Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found at the same level as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E

5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy <b>Flint</b> also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. <b>Flint</b> greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington.

Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, <b>Flint</b> greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|M-21A was an {{alternate}} route for M-21 near <b>Flint.</b> It started at an intersection between M-21 (Court Street) and US10 (Dort Highway) and ran southward concurrently with US10 to Lapeer Road. The highway turned eastward along Lapeer Road {{and out of}} the city of <b>Flint.</b> It continued to an intersection with M-15 south of Davison, where it turned northward, running concurrently with M-15 into downtown. At an intersection with M-21 at <b>Flint</b> Street, M-21A ended. The highway was created in 1929, and it was turned over to local control in late 1948.|$|E
5|$|M-56 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} highway from 1971 to {{the mid-1980s}} that replaced the M-21 designation from M-13 to <b>Flint</b> when the M-21 (now I-69) freeway was being built. The highway started at the intersection with M-13 on the Shiawassee–Genesee county line west of <b>Flint.</b> From there, it followed Corunna Road eastward through rural areas of Genesee County. Today, the area is farm fields through Clayton Township, and in <b>Flint</b> Township it is more suburban. The highway intersected the I-75/US10/US23 freeway just west of Flint's city line. Once in <b>Flint,</b> M-56 turned northeasterly onto Court Street. At an intersection with Saginaw Street, the highway turned southeasterly and then ended at the I-69/M-21 freeway.|$|E

5|$|Silver forces Jim {{to use the}} map, {{directing}} them to {{a portal}} that opens on any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how <b>Flint</b> conducted his raids. They open the portal {{to the center of}} Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a space station built eons ago that <b>Flint</b> commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of <b>Flint,</b> holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that <b>Flint</b> rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet begins to fall apart, Silver, trying to hold onto a boat-load of gold, opts to let it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the Legacy, which is damaged and unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the Legacy towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the Legacy safely clear the destruction.|$|E

5|$|A {{discontinuous}} {{section of}} M-78 freeway east of <b>Flint</b> {{was completed in}} 1969. The same year, I-475 was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway, after the founder of Buick Motor Company in Flint; the same legislation, House Concurrent Resolution22 of 1969 named the M-78 freeway through <b>Flint</b> for Louis Chevrolet. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. A freeway segment between <b>Flint</b> and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus. M-54 was redesignated M-56. The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after a Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69) designation was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry. On September 4 of that year, I-69's designation was officially extended by Congress to end at I-475 {{on the east side}} of Flint; this extension, and all subsequent ones, was of non-chargeable mileage, or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund.|$|E
