40|$|This {{contribution}} analyses {{the evolution}} of the case law of the CJEU on the scope of application of the fundamental <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> the fundamental rights, and on the interrelationship of those <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> rights. A common trait of the case law on fundamental <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> rights is the gradual expansion of their respective scope of application. This broadening of the scope of application has been accompanied by adjustments to the case law on the grounds of justification for restrictions of fundamental rights <b>and</b> fundamental <b>freedoms.</b> At the same time it has led to a steep increase in the areas of overlap between those <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> those rights, which raises new questions about their interaction at different levels of the EU legal order...|$|R

5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational <b>freedom,</b> <b>and</b> may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E

40|$|Provides an {{extensive}} survey of current Commonwealth laws that limit traditional rights, <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges, considers how such laws may be justified, and seeks {{feedback from the}} public. Overview This is the 2 nd consultation document for this Inquiry. The ALRC was asked to review Commonwealth laws that encroach on traditional rights, <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges (<b>Freedoms</b> Inquiry). Traditional rights include such fundamental freedoms as freedom of speech, religion, movement and association; and other important rights and privileges such as property rights, client legal privilege, {{the right to a}} fair trial, and access to the courts, to name a few. The Terms of Reference list 19 such rights, <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges to consider. In the Interim Report, the ALRC discusses the source and rationale of these important common law rights, <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges, and discusses how they have been protected by the Constitution, the Parliament and the courts. The Interim Report also provides {{an extensive}} survey of current Commonwealth laws that limit traditional rights, <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges and considers how such laws may be justified. The ALRC invites submissions in response to this Interim Report and, in particular, submissions identifying Commonwealth laws that warrant further review. The closing date for submissions is  21 September 2015.   Find out more about making submissions here...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> {{human rights}} is something the countries, and its citizens, of the European Union more or less take for granted. However, in recent years these rights have become a topic of discussion {{in the way that}} a debate about the Islamic headscarves has developed. This debate has resulted in that a number of countries, including France, have taken legislative measures to ban clothing that fully covers ones face. Out of these bans a discussion has arisen concerning the fundamental <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> human rights. These burqa bans, as it is labeled in the pubic debate, have been accused to wrongfully limit the individuals <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> human rights. This study therefore has the aim to analyze these burqa bans in relation to the European Union, United Nations and the Council of Europe’s general declarations concerning the fundamental <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> basic human rights. The main result of this study shows that these bans in fact is not a proportionally restrict in the fundamental <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> human rights. These results also are strengthened by the theoretical positions on freedom as put forth by Samuel Pufendorf and John Stuart Mill...|$|R
