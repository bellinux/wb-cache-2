There was a certain reinforcing effect of the filler on the PCL resin.

30|$|Including {{a greater}} amount of filler in the matrix reduces the organic content and the {{material}} shrinkage [22]. Commercial composites containing {{a higher percentage of}} charged particles per volume tend to produce higher stress values. Filtek Z 350 contains about 78.5 % <b>filler</b> by <b>weight</b> (63.3 % <b>filler</b> by volume), whereas Filtek Silorane contains 76 % <b>filler</b> by <b>weight</b> (55 % by volume). Kleverlaan and Feilzer (2005) [14] showed that dimethacrylate composites have percentage shrinkages of 2 – 4 % and stress values of 12 – 17  MPa, whereas other authors reported stress values of 6 – 9  MPa, and 8 – 12.5  MPa [26]. Thus, the material rigidity has a strong influence on the final polymerization tension [27]. As the rigidity is more associated with the crosslink density of the polymeric network than with the full conversion of the reactive species, the elastic modulus may be increased without much effect on the DC [2]. These explanations could help account for the higher elastic modulus values obtained with Filtek Silorane compared to Filtek Z 350.|$|R

40|$|The {{flashover}} characters under nanosecond pulsed voltage in {{transformer oil}} of epoxy resin and epoxy composites are reported. It is {{indicated that the}} flashover voltage of epoxy resin decreases while flashover times increase, and the surface damage and impurities caused by multiple flashovers {{are considered to be}} the reason. The movement of bubbles is restricted when liquid pressure increases, so the flashover voltage increases evidently. The relationship between pulse steepness and the flashover voltage is fit and extrapolated, and the fit result based on the reciprocal form of Schottky effect equation is preferable. In addition, the research of Micro TiO 2 /epoxy composite samples with different <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> percent demonstrates that while the weight percent of TiO 2 increases the flashover voltage varies as a 'V' style, and the lowest voltage value is obtained when the <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> gets about 20 %. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Thirteen dual cure luting {{composites}} {{were compared}} in function of film thickness, consistency, and working time {{by using the}} American National Standard/American Dental Association (ANS/ADA) specifications for zinc phosphate cement and direct filling resins. The effect of temperature and setting reaction on the film thickness was also evaluated for some representative products. All three clinically related properties varied widely among the products investigated. A strong linear correlation was found between film thickness and consistency. This relation {{is supported by the}} temperature dependence of film thickness of dual cure luting composites. Cooling of the material increased the consistency, resulting in a larger film thickness, while heating reduced the film thickness because of the lower consistency. However, one product with a rather short working time at room temperature occasionally exhibited a dramatically enlarged film thickness after heating, probably caused by accelerated chemical polymerization. No correlation emerged between film thickness and maximum filler size or between consistency and <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> content. Maximum filler size and <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> content had been measured previously in Part I of this study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the cured film thickness samples revealed that the largest filler particles had been crushed under the heavy load pressure during film thickness measurement. The lack of correlation between consistency and <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> content {{can be explained by the}} multifactorial determination of the consistency. It is concluded that the great diversity in the currently available luting composites makes clear specifications with regard to the optimum composition of luting composites urgently needed.

The weight percentage of filler particles and the morphology of the filler particles were also investigated. METHODS: Eight flowable resin composites (Admira Flow, Filtek Flow, FlowLine, Grandio Flow, Point- 4 Flowable, Revolution Formula 2, Tetric Flow and X-Flow) and four pit and fissure sealants (Clinpro, Delton FS(+), Estiseal F and Guardian Seal) were tested. Rheological measurements were performed using a dynamic oscillation rheometer. The <b>filler</b> <b>weight</b> content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the morphology of the particles was investigated by scanning-electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the <b>weight</b> fraction of <b>filler</b> in thirty-nine resin-based materials including flowable and packable composites, and to examine the morphology of the filler particles. The percentages of inorganic <b>fillers</b> by <b>weight</b> were determined by Thermogravimetric Analysis and by ashing in air technique at 900 degrees C. The size and shape of the filler particles were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after dissolution of the organic matrix. The weight fraction of inorganic fillers ranged between 41. 6 and 84. 6 %. Wide variations were found among materials of the same category. Values found {{in the present study were}} sometimes different from those given by the manufacturers. The SEM photomicrographs showed various shapes, and sizes of inorganic fillers. Compared with universal hybrid restorative materials, flowable composites have lower filler loading and packable resin composites did not show higher values as claimed by some manufacturers. Various factors may explain the observed discrepancies between the manufacturer's data and our results. The silane treatment as well as the incorporation of organic material as part of the fillers of the composite could be responsible for those differences. status: publishe...|$|R
