25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} is a <b>focal</b> <b>area</b> of French development cooperation with Morocco. In 2007 the French Development Agency (AFD) supported projects with {{a value of}} Euro 130m for urban and rural water supply and Euro 145m for sanitation. Geographically the projects are concentrated in the Sebou river basin, in Agadir and in Nador. In Nador French aid contributes through a loan approved in 2007 {{to clean up the}} highly polluted lagoon of Nador, the largest lagoon in the Mediterranean. The clean-up plan for the bay is inspired by similar experiences in France (Contrats de Baie) under which different public players work together for the common goal to clean up a coastal bay.|$|E
25|$|The Caribbean is a <b>focal</b> <b>area</b> {{for many}} hurricanes within the Western Hemisphere. A series of low {{pressure}} systems develop off the West coast of Africa {{and make their}} way across the Atlantic Ocean. While most of these systems do not become tropical storms, some do. The tropical storms can develop into Atlantic hurricanes, often in the low pressure areas of the eastern Caribbean. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the National Hurricane Center 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.|$|E

40|$|Within {{conservation}}, {{the need}} to measure the impacts on people from conservation initiatives such as projects and programs is growing, but understanding and measuring the multidimensional impacts on human well-being from conservation initiatives is complex. To understand the constituent components of human well-being and identify which components of well-being are most common, we analyzed 31 known indices for measuring human well-being. We found 11 <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> shared by two or more indices for measuring human well-being, and the <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> of living standards, health, education, social cohesion, security, environment, and governance were in at least 14 of the 31 human well-being indices. We examined each of the common <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> and assessed its relevance to measuring the human well-being impacts of a conservation initiative. We then looked for existing indices that include the relevant <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> and recommend the use of Stiglitz et al. (2009) —a framework designed to measure economic performance and social progress—as a starting place for understanding and selecting human well-being <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> suitable for measuring the impacts on people from a conservation initiative...|$|R

50|$|Temporal lobe {{resection}} acts as {{a treatment}} option for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, or epilepsy patients whose seizure focus is in the temporal lobe. Temporal lobe seizures {{are the most common}} type of seizures for teens and young adults with epilepsy. The procedure involves resecting, or cutting away, brain tissue within the region of the temporal lobe in order to remove the seizure focus. Specific evaluation for temporal lobe resection requires convergent clinical, MRI, and EEG data in order to precisely pinpoint the <b>focal</b> <b>area</b> and boundaries of the <b>focal</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{cystitis}} glandularis, non-mucinous and mucinous (intestinal).

Another distinction is made between <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> and diffuse involvement of the bladder. Whereas <b>focal</b> <b>areas</b> are more common, diffuse involvement is seen in chronically irritated bladders, such as in paraplegics or those with bladder stones or indwelling catheters. Individuals with diffuse intestinal-type cystitis glandularis {{are at increased risk}} for developing bladder cancer.|$|R
