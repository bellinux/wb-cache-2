5|$|Restoring {{the stream}} {{has made the}} area, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, highly popular. As {{recreational}} use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (Fossil Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply. Since 2009, the <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> {{has been working on}} a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek.|$|E

5|$|The {{first person}} to climb the {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, along {{with a group of}} United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897.

The trail is reached via <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. <b>Forest</b> <b>Service.</b> He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the <b>Forest</b> <b>Service,</b> from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

To protect and increase <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>services,</b> the driving factors underlying changes in <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> values must be determined to properly implement forest resource management planning. This study examines the driving {{factors that affect}} changes in <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> values by focusing on regional forest characteristics using a dataset of 47 prefectures in Japan for 2000, 2007, and 2012. We applied two approaches: a contingent valuation method for estimating the <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> value per area and a decomposition analysis for identifying the main driving factors {{of changes in the}} value of <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>services.</b> The results indicate that the value of <b>forest</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> has increased due to the expansion of forest area from 2000 to 2007. However, factors related to forest management and ecosystem service value per area have contributed to a decrease in the value of ecosystem services from 2000 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2012, respectively...|$|R
