5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin,</b> causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
25|$|For {{mothers to}} deliver oxygen to a fetus, it is {{necessary}} for the <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> to extract oxygen from the maternal oxygenated hemoglobin across the placenta. The higher oxygen affinity required for <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> is achieved by the protein subunit γ (gamma), instead of the β (beta) subunit. Because the γ subunit has fewer positive charges than the (adult) β subunit, 2,3-BPG is less electrostatically bound to <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> compared to adult hemoglobin. This lowered affinity allows for adult hemoglobin (maternal hemoglobin) to readily transfer its oxygen to the fetal bloodstream.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) {{are rare}} {{hereditary}} disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and by distinct morphological abnormalities of erythroblasts {{in the bone}} marrow. Characteristic morphological aberrations were the cornerstone of diagnosis, but following the identification of several causative genes, the molecular approach could represent a rapid tool for the identification of these conditions. This review presents advances in diagnosis and classification of CDAs. RECENT FINDINGS: The classification of CDAs has long been based on morphological features. Now, the discovery {{of some of the}} responsible genes allows reconsideration of part of the classification. The first CDA partly accounted for genetically has been CDA 1, through the discovery in 2002 of the gene responsible, CDAN 1, encoding codanin- 1. Recently, the dramatic identification of the genes responsible for CDA II, SEC 23 B, and for a hitherto unnamed CDA, KLF 1, took place. SEC 23 B encodes SEC 23 B which is a component of the coated vesicles transiting from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis compartment of the Golgi apparatus. A unique mutation in KLF 1, which encodes the erythroid transcription factor KLF 1, causes major ultrastructural abnormalities, the persistence of embryonic and <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobins,</b> and the absence of some red cell membrane proteins. SUMMARY: Studies of genotype-phenotype relationship, as has already been done for CDA II, will allow a more accurate prognosis. Identification of the responsible genes has opened new vistas for research on CDAs...|$|R

25|$|If <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> {{remains the}} {{predominant}} form of hemoglobin after birth, {{the number of}} painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> and can thus be used to treat sickle-cell disease. The fetal hemoglobin's reduction in {{the severity of the}} disease comes from its ability to inhibit the formation of hemoglobin aggregates within red blood cells which also contain hemoglobin S.

25|$|This greater {{affinity}} for oxygen {{is explained by}} the lack of fetal hemoglobin's interaction with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG or 2,3-DPG).

This is due to a change in a single amino acid (residue 143) found in the 2,3-BPG 'binding pocket': from histidine to serine, which gives rise to the greater oxygen affinity.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{identify}} antepartum fetal heart rate (FHR) records of high-frequency (HF) sinusoidal rhythms from an electronic database (1983 - 2003) and determine clinical outcomes. Study Design: At the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK), 72, 297 traces from 19, 506 women were analyzed using an algorithm that identifies HF sinusoidal rhythms. The case records were reviewed. Results: There were 15 (0. 21 / 1000) traces from 8 (0. 41 / 1000) women with an HF sinusoidal rhythm. In 5 of 8 women (62. 5 %), this pattern was associated with <b>fetal</b> anemia (<b>hemoglobin</b> < 10. 0 g/dL). Their FHR patterns were distinguished {{from those of the}} other nonanemic fetuses by significantly lower long-term variability. Conclusion: An antepartum HF sinusoidal rhythm is rare but associated with fetal anemia, particularly if it is combined with reduced long-term variability without episodes of high FHR variability within 60 minutes.

25|$|When <b>fetal</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> {{production}} is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA).

In cases where a pregnant woman has carbon monoxide poisoning there is evidence that lower pressure (2.0 ATA) HBOT treatments are not harmful to the fetus, and that the risk involved is outweighed by the greater risk of the untreated effects of CO on the fetus (neurologic abnormalities or death.) In pregnant patients, HBO therapy {{has been shown to be}} safe for the fetus when given at appropriate levels and “doses” (durations).

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} define the cellular level at which the gamma to beta globin switch is established in the developing simian fetus {{in order to determine}} whether the switch is controlled by environmental influences within differentiating erythroid precursors or predetermined by the genetic program of erythroid progenitors. Samples of marrow and liver were obtained from rhesus fetuses throughout the switch period, and marrow was obtained from adult rhesus monkeys. Globin chain synthesis was then measured in differentiated erythroblasts and in erythroid progenitor-derived colonies grown in semisolid media. The relative rates of synthesis of gamma and beta chains were determined by the uptake of [3 H]leucine into the respective chains separated by Triton gel electrophoresis and in some cases by urea carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. Four periods of the switch were defined during fetal development. In the preswitch period both erythroblasts and progenitor-derived colonies produced < 5 % beta globin. In the early switch erythroblasts produced 5 - 15 % beta globin, while progenitor-derived colonies produced 10 - 35 % beta globin. In mid-switch erythroblasts synthesized 50 % beta globin, whereas progenitor-derived colonies produced only 15 - 35 % beta. At the completion of the switch erythroblasts produced 100 % beta globin, while progenitor-derived colonies produced as little as 40 % beta chains. We conclude that the program of globin synthesis that characterizes the fetal switch is established at the level of erythroid progenitors. Fetal erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) dominate the marrow prior to the switch. The early switch period is heralded by the appearances of adult erythroid burst-forming units programmed to express increasing beta chain synthesis in colonies. By mid-switch a second class of adult erythroid progenitors capable of giving rise to <b>fetal</b> and adult <b>hemoglobin</b> synthesis in in vitro colonies becomes apparent. These shifting populations of erythroid progenitors with unique globin synthesis programs give rise to the erythroblasts that create the sigmoid pattern of the <b>fetal</b> to adult <b>hemoglobin</b> switch in the developing simian fetus...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are {{a family}} of small non-coding RNAs that {{regulate}} gene expression by targeting mRNAs in a sequence specific manner, inducing translational repression or mRNA degradation. MicroRNAs have been found {{deeply involved in the}} control of erythroid differentiation. In human trisomy 13, there is delayed switching and persistence of HbF and elevation of embryonic hemoglobin in newborns (Sankaran et al., 2001). By examining the genes in this region, two microRNAs, miR- 15 a and miR- 16 - 1, appear as top candidates for the elevated HbF levels. Increased expression of these microRNAs in primary human erythroid progenitor cells results in elevated <b>fetal</b> and embryonic <b>hemoglobin</b> gene expression. The target of these microRNAs was identified in MYB mRNA; interestingly, MYB {{plays an important role in}} silencing the <b>fetal</b> and embryonic <b>hemoglobin</b> genes. The microRNA miR- 486 - 3 p regulates BCL 11 A expression by binding to the extra-long isoform of BCL 11 A 3 'UTR (Lulli et al., 2013). Overexpression of miR- 486 - 3 p in erythroid cells resulted in reduced BCL 11 A protein levels, associated to increased expression of beta-globin gene, whereas inhibition of physiological miR- 486 - 3 p levels increased BCL 11 A and, consequently, reduced beta-globin expression. The data obtained indicate that BCL 11 A, one of the major repressor of beta-globin gene expression, is a molecular target of miR- 486 - 3 p; accordingly, pharmacological mediated up-regulation of miR- 486 - 3 p might lead to BCL 11 A down-regulation and, consequently activation of the beta-globin gene expression. Other microRNAs found up-regulated in association with beta-globin gene expression were miR- 210 (Bianchi et al., 2009), miR- 26 b (Alijani et al., 2014), miR- 451 (Kouhkan et al., 2014). As a first conclusion, the findings that microRNAs are involved in beta-globin anticipate the possibility that their pharmacological alteration might be a key strategy for increase HbF in erythroid cells...|$|R

Gut sections showed, in addition to erythrocytes, hemoglobin protein staining in rare, individual villus epithelial cells. These results suggest a paradigm shift: hemoglobin subunits are expressed in the avascular lens and cornea and in pre-hematopoietic embryos.
