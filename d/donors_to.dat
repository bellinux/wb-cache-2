5|$|In western societies, {{voluntary}} {{blood donation}} is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk taking. Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection. If blood donation {{is an opportunity to}} send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy. In a survey, both donors and non-donors expressed perceptions of the health, generosity, and ability of blood <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> operate in stressful situations.|$|E

5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1970, {{the diamond}} was rated {{one of the}} thirty great stones {{of the world and}} placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old {{trucking}} firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. This was the second highest auction price ever for a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit as a means to attract <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> that benefit.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundInternational Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation {{guidelines}} for adult heart transplantation (HT) suggest a <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> recipient body weight ratio (WR) of greater than 0. 8. For female to male transplants, a WR of greater than 0. 9 is recommended. MethodsThe United Network for Organ Sharing database was examined for adult HT from 1999 to 2011. Controls with a WR of 0. 9 or greater (normal <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> recipient weight ratio) {{were compared with}} patients with a WR of 0. 6 to 0. 89 (WRL) and a WR of less than 0. 59 (WRVL). The primary measured outcome was survival. ResultsOf the 21, 928 patients undergoing HT, 14, 592 (66. 6 %) were performed with a normal <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> recipient weight ratio, 7212 (32. 9 %) were performed with WRL, and 124 (0. 6 %) were performed with WRVL. In male <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> male recipient, male <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> female recipient, and female <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> female recipient HT, the use of WRL did not influence median survival (P = . 3621) and {{was not associated with}} increased mortality (P = . 7273). In female <b>donor</b> <b>to</b> male recipient HT, WRL was associated with decreased median survival (435 days, P = . 0241) and was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1. 201; P = . 0383). ConclusionsHT can be safely performed using WRL donors between sex-matched and male to female transplants. However, in female to male transplants, WRL donors are associated with decreased survival. Although clinical circumstances will guide decision making, consensus criteria may be revisited to liberalize the pool of acceptable donors in an era of unprecedented donor shortage...|$|R

5|$|In {{the fall}} of the 2006–07 season, the Harris Theater hosted the New York City Ballet for five days of {{performances}} that marked the company's first visit to Chicago in over 25years. This presentation grossed $2.3million and enticed 600 new <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> support the theater, which netted $800,000 for operations and rental subsidies for its resident troupes. This contributed to the theater's first year of profitability in fiscal year 2007; it had net income of $1.3million on revenues of $8.2million. In , Mikhail Baryshnikov made his first visit to Chicago as a performer in seven years, with two shows at the theater.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E
5|$|Fund-raising for {{the center}} was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton's who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton-Gore {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie {{to use the money}} from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to {{free and fair}} elections. A number of key international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest bilateral donor and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in planned aid. The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former <b>donors</b> <b>to</b> recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E
