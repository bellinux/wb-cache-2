5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror.

5|$|In 922 the Bulgarians renewed their {{offensive}} in Thrace {{to divert the}} Byzantines from the clandestine negotiations with the Fatimid Caliphate to form a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople. Simeon I remained at the siege of Adrianople while another army {{was sent to the}} Byzantine capital. In June 922 the Bulgarians engaged and defeated yet another Byzantine army. A few weeks later Adrianople surrendered. In the meantime, the Byzantines captured the ship with the Bulgarian and Fatimid envoys on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Bulgaria. Romanos I thus learned about the negotiations and outbid the Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|The 17th Brigade's advance {{continued}} {{for the next}} two days until, when the brigade had reached the final ridge before Salamaua, the 29th Brigade arrived to take over. The 2/7th Infantry Battalion, however, still detached to the 15th Brigade, continued on with them and as a result remained in the thick of it until the end when Salamaua fell on 20 September. Meanwhile, the rest of the 17th Brigade was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Australia and by mid-September, it arrived on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland where it was once again was placed under the 6th Division's command.

5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905.

This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E

Living conditions were hard, many African natives were taken captives and transported across the ocean to be sold as slaves, sometimes even betrayed by their own people, which is vividly depicted in the song [...] "The King Who Sold His Own". All in all it was an environment, where it was only natural for the Blues to develop, {{and even though the}} instrumentation and the construction of the songs was still very different from what we now know as Blues, the basics were already there: the sadness, the strain, the burdens, the depression, the feeling of [...] "blue" [...] and - of course - the underlying musical structure.Track list: ...|$|R

5|$|By July 1943, the 7th Division was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Port Moresby. Vasey flew up to {{work out}} {{arrangements}} with Herring and the air commander in New Guinea, Major General Ennis Whitehead of the US Fifth Air Force. Probably inspired by his experience on Crete, Vasey proposed using paratroops, and pressed his superiors for an entire regiment instead of the battalion he was originally allotted. The new campaign opened in spectacular fashion on 5 September 1943 with a parachute drop of the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment in broad daylight to seize the airstrip at Nadzab in the Markham Valley. They were soon reinforced by Australian and Papuan troops that had advanced overland from Wau, {{and then by the}} 7th Division's 25th Infantry Brigade, which flew in by air.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the living.|$|E

The CSS Alabama rendezvoused a few times with her daughter ship, the CSS Tuscaloosa.|$|R
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
5|$|Talk {{was also}} abuzz {{throughout}} Singapore of the Komagata Maru {{incident in which}} Canadian authorities refused to allow a ship with 376 Indian passengers to land and forced them to stay aboard for 2 months in difficult conditions. On <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to India, while the ship docked in Singapore, the governor-general of Singapore remarked that “though the ship had no communication with the land, yet it left a bad effect” on the Indian troops stationed there. Clearly, information was reaching the sepoys through {{a wide range of}} channels many originating as far as North America, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and India. Much of this information was obtained locally, but even so it was being mediated through a host of international and external actors, including a wide array of Indians from across the subcontinent, British officers and Arab and Malay coreligionists.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{immediately}} renewed {{their attacks}} {{on the night of}} November 26. A counterattack from Chinaman's Hat soon captured the 23rd Infantry Regiment's command post. On the 23rd Infantry Regiment's left, the 9th Infantry Regiment's G Company was also overran by the attacking Chinese forces, forcing Colonel Charles C. Sloane Jr. to withdraw the remnants of his regiment across the river. Chinese ambushes in the rear then decimated the rest of the 9th Infantry Regiment. To the US 2nd Infantry Division's right, Commander Wen Yuchen of the PVA 40th Corps ordered the 119th Division to destroy the 38th Infantry Regiment {{in order to protect the}} Chinese breakthrough on the UN right flank. The ferocious fighting soon forced the 38th Infantry Regiment to fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Kujang-dong in order to rejoin the division.|$|E

5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows.

A little further south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but the navigation below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E
5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the Texel. The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to aim at the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E
5|$|HMS Fife (a Royal Navy County Class Destroyer) was on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the United Kingdom {{when the}} {{hurricane}} struck, and was {{turned back to}} provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas The Fife docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done {{and how to get}} assistance. This was the first time a Royal Navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service.|$|E
50|$|The Municipality of Nabua {{traces the}} {{historical}} origin of <b>its</b> name <b>way</b> <b>back</b> during the Spanish Colonization.

The good friar found persons inside the said rancheria cutting coconuts. He was offered to partake the inside shoot of coconut which the natives called “BOA”. Immediately, the good friar tagged the place as “NABUA” pronounced with his Spanish Accent. From that time onwards this place become popularly known as NABUA.|$|R
