40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an experimental chip of self-timed (clockless) power-aware pipeline incorporating stage-by-stage power gating scheme. Its power <b>gating</b> <b>circuit</b> cuts the voltage-supply to the idle pipeline stages {{in order to}} reduce the static (leakage) power dissipation. To reduce the dynamic power dissipation, self-timed pipeline (STP) is one of the suitable circuit architectures because its ondemand transfer control activates only the pipeline stages operating valid data and thus unexpected signal propagation resulting in transistor switching is gated at pipeline stage level. Moreover, each pipeline stage can be slowed down in parallel with processing by introducing dynamic voltage scaling techniques and thus both the dynamic and static power dissipations can be reduced. In this paper, powerperformance characteristics of the self-timed power-aware pipeline (ULP-STP) are experimentally analyzed through measuring the actual 65 nm CMOS LSI chips and simulating the optimized ULP-STP.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing the gate sizes or scale factors in a combinational logic circuit {{in order to minimize}} the total area, subject to simple RC timing constraints, and a minimum allowed gate size. This problem is well known to be a geometric program (GP), and can be solved using standard interior-point methods for small and medium size problems with up to several thousand gates. In this paper we describe a new method for solving this problem that handles far larger circuits, up to a million gates, and is far faster. Numerical experiments show that our method can compute an adequately accurate solution within around 200 iterations; each iteration, in turn, consists of a few passes over the circuit. In particular, the complexity of our method, with a fixed number of iterations, is linear in the number of gates.

In this era, where technologies such as smart grid are developed, scope for power optimisation is increasing.

We define wakeup scheduling as to determine turn-on time and signal slew of each switch cell; {{the goal is to}} minimize wakeup delay while keeping rush current below the maximum value that is allowed. The determined turn-on time and signal slew are implemented using a buffered tree. The wakeup scheduling and buffered tree construction are integrated into a design flow. To adapt to process variation, we use adjustable delay buffers in the wakeup network. We also apply grid-based design flow and use Schmitt triggers to implement large designs.

40|$|Lowering {{supply voltage}} {{is one of}} the most {{effective}} techniques for reducing microprocessor power consumption. Unfortunately, at low voltages, chips are very sensitive to process variation, which can lead to large differences in the maximum frequency achieved by individual cores. This paper presents Booster, a simple, low-overhead framework for dynamically rebalancing performance heterogeneity caused by process variation and application imbalance. The Booster CMP includes two power supply rails set at two very low but different voltages. Each core can be dynamically assigned to either of the two rails using a <b>gating</b> <b>circuit.</b> This allows cores to quickly switch between two different frequencies. An on-chip governor controls the timing of the switching and the time spent on each rail. The governor manages a “boost budget ” that dictates how many cores can be sped up (depending on the power constraints) at any given time. We present two implementations of Booster: Booster VAR, which virtually eliminates the effects of core-to-core frequency variation in near-threshold CMPs, and Booster SYNC, which additionally reduces the effects of imbalance in multithreaded applications. Evaluation using PARSEC and SPLASH 2 benchmarks running on a simulated 32 -core system shows an average performance improvement of 11 % for Booster VAR and 23 % for Booster SYNC. 1...|$|E

The requirements on detector package are rather different from the ground based laser ranging systems [1]. Recently, the most challenging task {{is the development of}} the solid state detector package capable of non gated operation. The existing detector configurations do not permit non gated operation due to the excess dark count rate of the detector, which is caused by strong after pulsing effect. The after pulsing effect is strongly influenced by the quenching circuit. The longer it takes to quench the avalanche after a photon detection, the stronger is the after effect. The conventional active quenching circuits have a loop delay in the range 20 - 30 nanoseconds. We have developed a new active quenching and <b>gating</b> <b>circuit</b> with the loop delay shorter than 3 nanoseconds. It enables to operate the K 14 series SPAD detectors in the non gated mode with the acceptable dark count rates and timing resolution, as well. The circuit permits to operate the detector 0. 1 to 1. 1 Volt above its break voltage. Using the chips with 40 um in diameter, the dark count rates below 15 kHz and a timing resolution of 30 picoseconds have been obtained at a room temperature and non gated operation.

40|$|Photonuclear {{resonance}} excitation {{refers to}} a variety of photonuclear interaction processes that lead to the excitation of a nucleus from some initial state to a higher energy nuclear state. Typical excited nuclear state lifetimes are short, ranging from nanoseconds to femtoseconds or less; however, some isotopes have unusually long-lived excited nuclear energy states, or isomers. This dissertation examines the feasibility of using bremsstrahlung irradiation sources to produce isomers for industrial applications. In contrast with charged particle based isomer production, the use of high energy photons allows for the irradiation and production of isomers in bulk materials. The commercial availability of reliable, high power industrial electron accelerators means that isomer activities sufficient for industrial applications may be achieved using bremsstrahlung, in contrast with neutron based approaches where suitable neutron sources of sufficient intensity for these applications are lacking. In order to design a system for creating nuclear isomers using photons, the resonant photon absorption isomeric excitation cross section must be known. Unlike neutron absorption and scattering cross sections, comparatively little information exists for photon isomeric excitation. To address this, a theoretical model based upon statistical probability distributions of nuclear energy levels has been developed for calculating photon excitation cross sections at energies below neutron and proton binding energies; the ideal region of operation for most applications in order to minimize long term activation of materials. Isomeric excitation cross sections calculated using this technique have been compared with experimentally measured values and are found to agree to within a factor of two or better. (cont.) sing this, a general transition equation suitable for both nuclear resonance fluorescence and isomer excitation has been developed for calculating nuclear level distribution probabilities for materials undergoing photon irradiation. Experiments have been carried out using an industrial 6 MeV electron accelerator to identify obstacles related to nuclear resonance fluorescence measurements as well as measurements of the decay of short-lived isomers using scintillators in the vicinity of high intensity bremsstrahlung sources. Use of a fast switching <b>gating</b> <b>circuit</b> in combination with a pulsed accelerator was found to be a satisfactory solution for dealing with problems related to the performance of a detectors photomultiplier tube as a result of exposure to scattered radiation during the beam pulse. Calculations have been carried out to assess the performance characteristics which could be expected from industrial photonuclear resonance excitation systems, based upon a 10 MeV electron accelerator. For simple isomer production, specific activities on the order of 1 mCi/g/mA can be expected for irradiation periods sufficiently long for equilibrium to be reached. For the analysis of arsenic concentrations in environmental samples, sensitivities of 1 +/- 0. 1 ppm could be achieved using accelerator currents of 50 - 100 [mu]A with irradiations times of a few minutes or less.
