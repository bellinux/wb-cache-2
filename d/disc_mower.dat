40|$|Field drying {{experiments}} {{in summer and}} winter compared the drying rate of lucerne hay cut with a rotary <b>disc</b> <b>mower</b> and mower-conditioner, with or without 300 1 ha of 2 % aqueous potassium carbonate solution sprayed at cutting. Local farm practice was followed in cutting, raking and drying. Statistical analysis showed significant treatment differences in both summer and winter experiments. Mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning treatment provided the greatest field drying rate, followed by chemical conditioning alone, mechanical conditioning alone and non-conditioned lucerne, respectively. The effectiveness of mechanical and chemical conditioning treatments was greater in summer than in winter. Under good S. E. Queensland summer conditions, mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning would allow hay to be cut and baled on the same day, but at least 4 days were required under cool winter weather conditions...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle bar <b>mowers,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>mowers,</b> and drum mowers. Sickle bar mowers use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. <b>Disc</b> <b>mowers</b> {{have a number of}} hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. Drum mowers use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over <b>disc</b> <b>mowers</b> and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. <b>Disc</b> <b>mowers</b> were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern <b>disc</b> <b>mowers</b> use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|R

Now the traditional domestic design mainly based on the empirical design, which is resulted in Performance indicators lag behind of the mower, focusing on the performance of vibration is too large and the structure is irrational. Therefore, optimizing the structure of the mower to improve the vibration situation has important significance. Using SolidWorks software to build the three-dimensional solid model of the first mower driveline, and then import the model into ANSYS Workbench to establish the finite element analysis model, through the finite element and modal analysis of the results obtained the stress and strain distribution of the natural frequencies and mode shapes characteristic, providing an important basis for further design optimization of mower structure...|$|E
40|$|Rotary disc mowers {{are capable}} of much higher {{throughput}} than traditional mowers, {{and as a result}} have much higher power demands. With the recent increasing popularity of rotary mowers and the ever-increasing size of high-capacity forage and haying equipment, manufacturers are offering larger mowers with higher power demands. A <b>disc</b> <b>mower</b> cutterbar requires a significant amount of the total implement power, and little research has been performed relating to the study of power requirements and material movement. The objectives of this research were to develop a means of measuring cutterbar power requirements and material flow, and to perform a statistical design of the mower in operation. Using these results, {{it may be possible to}} offer insight into changes that could be considered in the design of rotary mower cutterbars. Two types of experiments were performed on a prototype <b>disc</b> <b>mower.</b> Both experiments were performed in both alfalfa and light grass, at three different ground speeds, and at three different disc rotational velocities. The first experiment consisted of measuring the power requirements and specific energy of three individual discs on the prototype cutterbar. The rotational direction of the three adjacent discs investigated produce converging and diverging cutting zones. Measurements were made by means of instrumented drive hubs, each with individual onboard data acquisition systems. Average power measurements recorded by each instrumented hub were found to be approximately 2. 45 and 3. 31 kW for alfalfa and grass, respectively. Likewise, average specific energy measurements for alfalfa and grass ranged from 1. 83 to 5. 74 kW•h/t, respectively. The second experiment involved the optical flow field calculation from high-speed videos captured of the cutterbar in operation. A phase-based optical flow algorithm was applied to videos captured to study material flow across the cutterbar. An analytical model and two regression models were developed to describe and predict the cutterbar specific energy at the converging and diverging zones. The analytical model was based on the cutting and transport processes as performed by the rotating discs, as well as the zero-load power. The model included the results of the averaged material flow vector angles. The regression models were fitted to the experimental specific energy results as a function of the different combinations of effects in the experimental design. All three models, which were produced for both the converging and diverging cutting zones, were found with coefficient of determination values between 0. 79 and 0. 96...|$|E
40|$|Finland’s {{policy of}} subsidising the {{conversion}} to organic production precipitated {{the rapid growth}} of organic farming in the 1990 ’s. As a consequence, many stockless farms encountered the problems of nitrogen deficit, poor grain quality, and weed control. Since the spreading of green mulch on cash crops is very common especially in tropical agriculture, organic fertilisers like green mulch may be an alternative that would compensate for the prohibition on the use of mineral N-fertilisers. However, one problem is that presently there is no appropriate technique available to substitute for the strenuous handwork of spreading green mulch. The main subject of this research report is the technique of green mulch spreading. Between 1994 and 1997, a green mulch spreading prototype was developed and tested. An evaluation of four different spreading techniques, including the prototype, revealed that the optimal technique was still not found and that none of the techniques considered in this report achieved the quality of hand work. The prototype did, however, allow us to perform experiments using different green mulch crops and/or mixtures of green mulch crops to a greater extent. From 1996 - 1999 experiments were conducted using the following crops as green mulch: rye Secale cereale, red clover Trifolium pratense, alfalfa Medicago sativa, timothy Phleum pratense, meadow fescue Festuca pratensis, reed canary grass Phalaris arundinaceae and different mixtures of them. Green mulch was applied to following cash crops: Cabbage Brassica oleracea var. capitata, burdock Arctium lappa, valerian Valeriana, peppermint Mentha piperita, anise hyssop Agastache foeniculum, stinging nettle Urtica dioica, spring wheat Triticum aestivum, and spring barley Hordeum vulgare. The experiments produced the following results: 1) The fertilising effect of green mulch application is ambiguous. 2) Weather conditions influence both the mineralisation and the quantity of green mulch, the timing, and the frequency of mulching. 3) Persisting green mulch cover can be achieved using rye or reed canary grass. 4) An area ratio of 4 : 1 green mulch crop : cash crop seems to be sufficient for weed control. 5) With the exception of wet young red clover, all of the green mulch crops used were suitable for the prototype machine. On condition that the weather is suitable, the strip intercropping technique in combination with the row mulching machine of Fischer Ltd. is presently the best available green mulch spreading-technique. Only zero traffic technology such as gantry technology offers perfect green mulch spreading which is independent from weather and soil conditions. However, even improved spreading technique does not solve the other problem, which is caused by weather conditions: Uncertain growth and mineralisation of green mulch. This is mainly a problem in North European countries where conditions are the opposite of those in tropical areas. In tropical areas, temperature and humidity always ensure both, vigorous growth and rapid mineralisation. In any event, a legume-rich crop rotation and organic manure from livestock would be the better alternative for fertilisation in organic farming under North European conditions. Another alternative is the use of milled seeds of legumes, hornmeal or cake of Ricinus communis. For these materials, traditional fertilising machinery is available. The application of these organic fertilisers is not weather dependent and they can be produced and purchased far from the location of application. The worldwide application of green mulch is essential for a sustainable agriculture. Although in most tropical countries spreading is still done by hand, the mechanisation of green mulch spreading will gain increasing importance in the near future.

50|$|In 1997, Fella {{brought in}} {{a new concept to}} the way their {{manufacturing}} plant was set up. The decision was made to create four self-governing buildings. Each of these buildings would be responsible for its own machine type: one building for drum <b>mowers,</b> one for <b>disc</b> <b>mowers,</b> one for tedders, and one for rakes. There would be two responsible managers for the factory workers as well as the production requirements and plant management.

50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, <b>disc</b> <b>mowers</b> or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, haying has {{extended}} to Iberian Mediterranean dry grasslands potentially impacting on grassland bird ecology. We evaluated {{the impact of}} haying on a grassland bird community of South Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate the exposure of different species to haying, (2) to investigate potential removal of nests and dead birds from hayed fields by haying machinery using the ratio (REC) between the expected number of records {{and the number of}} records collected and (3) to link clutch destruction and bird mortality with haying management practices. Hayed fields were surveyed for signs of breeding and birds censused prior to mowing. Linear models were computed, linking the REC with haying machinery and sward properties. GLMs and model averaging were used to obtain models linking clutch destruction, bird mortality and haying management variables. Only 4 % of records evidenced successful nesting attempts (N[*]=[*] 177). REC evaluation suggested high nest or dead bird removal by the machinery, particularly in fields with lower vegetation biomass prior to cutting. Sickle bar mowers and one-rotor rotary rakes returned higher REC but lower probability of found nests removed from the original nesting sites comparatively to <b>discs</b> <b>mowers</b> and wheel rakes. Higher probabilities of mortality events were found in fields mown earlier (but not in all years). On the other hand, lower mortality was found in fields raked with two-rotor rotary rakes. Delayed haying, silage production in temporary crops and the use haying machinery enabling simultaneously mowing and gathering hay in lines are discussed as management alternatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} practices on wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) movements and survivorship {{was investigated in}} a fragmented agri-forest landscape over two years. Agricultural activities and machinery contributed {{to the death of}} 20 % of radio-tracked turtles. Annual survivorship of adults was 0. 904 and 0. 868 and for juveniles it was 0. 815 and 0. 831 for 1998 and 1999, respectively. Mutilation rates in adults were 90 % +/- 3 % in both years; in contrast, the maximum rate in juveniles was 57 %. Setting the cutting height of <b>disc</b> <b>mowers</b> to 100 mm would increase harvest yields, reduce wear on machinery, decrease soil erosion, and reduce turtle mortality and mutilation rates. The concepts of integral, statistical, and linear range are introduced as distinct estimators of turtle movements. Since integral ranges include all habitats critical to survival, they provide an important contribution to our knowledge of imperiled species. Statistical ranges are stable and easily promote within and between study comparisons. Linear ranges quantify migratory and ranging movements. Thread-trailing techniques were used to record the fine-scale movements of six adult male G. insculpta translocated to an experimental hayfield patch-matrix. Although patch size had no effect on move length or path sinuosity, habitat structure did. Paths were generally straighter and move length longer in the harvested portion of a hayfield. Apparent habitat boundaries were shown to be permeable. Subjects exhibit three movement phases: agitation dispersal, local search, and ranging. Thus, G. insculpta exhibit predetermined movement patterns and move to maximize the likelihood of locating resources, while minimizing the probability of revisiting previously searched areas. Recent changes in agricultural practices and machinery are having a decidedly negative impact on G. insculpta. This study provides new insights into the movements of G. insculpta. Such knowledge will be an e...|$|R
