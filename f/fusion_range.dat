50|$|The prism <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> (PFR) or fusional vergence {{amplitude}} is {{a clinical}} eye test performed by orthoptists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists to assess motor fusion, specifically {{the extent to}} which a patient can maintain binocular single vision (BSV) in the presence of increasing vergence demands. Motor fusion is largely accounted to amplitudes of fusional vergences and relative fusional vergences. Fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling BSV and the limit is at the point of diplopia (double vision). Relative fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling a patient to see a comfortable clear image and the limit is represented by the first point of blur. These motor fusion functions should fall within average values so that BSV can be comfortably achieved. Excessive stress on the vergence system or inability to converge or diverge adequately can lead to asthenopic symptoms, which generally result from decompensation of latent deviations (heterophoria) or loss of control of ocular misalignments. Motor anomalies can be managed in various ways, however, in order to commence treatment, motor fusion testing such as the PFR is required. The PFR involves placing a prism bar in front of an eye. In a patient with BSV, a natural shift of the eye occurs. When measuring horizontal fusion ranges, base in prisms assess fusional divergence while base out prisms assess fusional convergence. The vertical fusional vergence amplitude can also be measured with base up and base down prisms although the horizontal PFR is typically the main focus when testing. When performing the PFR, prism strengths are increased, placing greater demand on the vergence system, eventually resulting in a break point accompanying diplopia. Break point, recovery and blur are key aspects of this assessment. The break point occurs at the loss of BSV, recovery point when BSV is regained from break and blur point is at the loss of comfortable BSV. These stops can be subjectively indicated when the patient notices a double or blurred image. Both subjective and objective measurements can be considered however the examiner’s objective observation is the gold standard.|$|E

The simultaneous perception, <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> and distance stereopsis were measured. According to the refractive {{condition of the}} children who were divided into group A(myopia, 20 cases) and group B(hyperopia, 30 cases). The statistically difference of simultaneous perception, fusion function and stereopsis in two groups was analyzed. RESULTS:Fifteen(75 %) and twenty-six(87 %) children got the simultaneous perception in group A and group B respectively, and the differences between two groups were not significant(χ 2 = 0. 454, P > 0. 05). Group A had six children(30 %) and group B had only seven children(23 %) with the normal aggregative <b>fusion</b> <b>range,</b> two groups did not show any difference(χ 2 = 0. 565, P > 0. 05).

40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{methods of}} detecting signs of visual complaints associated with stereoscopic displays. Two potential causes for contradictory results concerning these signs {{in previous research}} are hypothesized: (1) not all clinical tests are equally appropriate, and (2) {{there is a natural}} variation in susceptibility amongst people with normal vision. An optometric screening differentiated participants with moderate binocular status (MBS) from those with good binocular status (GBS). In a 2 × 2 within-subjects design (2 -D vs. 3 -D and MBS vs. GBS), a questionnaire and eight optometric tests (i. e., binocular acuity, aligning prism, fixation disparity, heterophoria, convergent and divergent fusional reserves, vergence facility, accommodation response) were each administered before and immediately after a reading task. Results revealed that only participants with MBS in 3 -D conditions showed clinically meaningful changes in <b>fusion</b> <b>range,</b> experienced more visual discomfort, and performed worse on the reading task. A combination of <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> measurements and self-report is appropriate for evaluating visual complaints of stereoscopic stills, and people with a MBS are more susceptible to visual complaints associated with stereoscopic displays.

40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{devise a}} model-based method for {{estimating}} the probabilities of binocular fusion, interocular suppression and diplopia from psychophysical judgements, (2) To map {{out the way}} fusion, suppression and diplopia vary with binocular disparity and blur of single edges shown to each eye, (3) To compare the binocular interactions found for edges of the same vs opposite contrast polarity. Methods: Test images were single, horizontal, Gaussian-blurred edges, with blur B =  1 - 32  min arc, and vertical disparity 0 - 8. B, shown for 200  ms. In the main experiment, observers reported whether they saw one central edge, one offset edge, or two edges. We argue that the relation between these three response categories and the three perceptual states (fusion, suppression, diplopia) is indirect and likely to be distorted by positional noise and criterion effects, and so we developed a descriptive, probabilistic model to estimate both the perceptual states and the noise/criterion parameters from the data. Results: (1) Using simulated data, we validated the model-based method by showing that it recovered fairly accurately the disparity ranges for fusion and suppression, (2) The disparity range for fusion (Panum's limit) increased greatly with blur, in line with previous studies. The disparity range for suppression {{was similar to the}} fusion limit at large blurs, but two or three times the fusion limit at small blurs. This meant that diplopia was much more prevalent at larger blurs, (3) Diplopia was much more frequent when the two edges had opposite contrast polarity. A formal comparison of models indicated that fusion occurs for same, but not opposite, polarities. Probability of suppression was greater for unequal contrasts, and it was always the lower-contrast edge that was suppressed. Conclusions: Our model-based data analysis offers a useful tool for probing binocular fusion and suppression psychophysically. The disparity range for fusion increased with edge blur but fell short of complete scale-invariance. The disparity range for suppression also increased with blur but was not close to scale-invariance. Single vision occurs through fusion, but also beyond the <b>fusion</b> <b>range,</b> through suppression. Thus suppression can serve as a mechanism for extending single vision to larger disparities, but mainly for sharper edges where the <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> is small (5 - 10  min arc). For large blurs the <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> is so much larger that no such extension may be needed...|$|E

40|$|Study Design. Comparison of 2 {{radiographic}} scoliosis classification {{systems by}} multiple surgeons. Objective. Compare {{the reliability of}} Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and Lenke scoliosis classification systems and analyze their differences. Summary of Background Data. The PUMC classification is a newly reported system based on radiographic measurements with recent popularity, while the Lenke classification is widely accepted worldwide in surgical design. Both these classification systems have their own individual characteristics, hence {{it is necessary to}} compare their reliability. Methods. Five scoliosis surgeons independently evaluated and classified presurgical radiographs of 62 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients based on the PUMC and Lenke classification systems on 2 separate occasions. Radiographs were cleaned before each evaluation. Inter- and intraobserver reliabilities were quantified using Kappa statistics. Data were compared using χ analysis. Results. The PUMC classification's inter- and intraobserver percentage of agreement averaged to 91. 0 % (Kappa coefficient 0. 896) and 90. 2 % (Kappa coefficient 0. 892), respectively. While those of the Lenke curve type classification were 86. 5 % (Kappa coefficient 0. 808) and 87. 4 % (Kappa coefficient 0. 826). The PUMC classification from 10 individual measurements had 17 cases (27. 4 %) of disagreements, while in the Lenke curve type classification, 24 cases (38. 7 %) had disagreements. PUMC classification normally has discrepancies between type IIb, IIc, and IId, while Lenke classification has discrepancies in curve types 1 and 2. Out of 17 inconsistent PUMC curve type cases, 7 did not affect surgical fusion levels, while in the Lenke's only 2 out of 24 cases with discrepancies did not affect <b>fusion</b> <b>range</b> selection, with an obvious statistical difference. Conclusion. The reliability of both PUMC classification and Lenke curve type classification were categorized as good-to-excellent. PUMC classification is relatively simple, with less confusion among inter- and intraobservers, with corresponding surgical fusion guidance and planning.

40|$|Introduction - No {{validated}} protocol {{exists for}} {{the measurement of}} the prism <b>fusion</b> <b>ranges.</b> Many studies report on how fusional vergence ranges can be measured using different techniques (rotary prism, prism bar, loose prisms and synoptophore) and stimuli, leading to different ranges being reported in the literature. Repeatability of the different methods available and the equivalence between them it is also important. In addition, some studies available do not agree in what order fusional vergence should be measured to provide the essential information {{on which to base}} clinical judgements on compensation of deviations. When performing fusional vergence testing the most commonly accepted clinical technique is to first measure negative fusional vergence followed by a measurement of positive fusional vergence to avoid affecting the value of vergence recovery because of excessive stimulation of convergence. Von Noorden recommend using vertical fusion amplitudes in between horizontal amplitudes (base-out, base-up, base-in, and base down) to prevent vergence adaptation. Others place the base of the prism in the direction opposite to that used to measure the deviation to increase the vergence demand. Objectives - The purpose of this review is to assess and compare the accuracy of tests for measurement of fusional vergence. Secondary objectives are to investigate sources of heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy including: age; variation in method of assessment; study design; study size; type of strabismus (convergent, divergent, vertical, cycle); severity of strabismus (constant/intermittent/latent) ...|$|R
40|$|Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is an {{important}} input for geo-spatial analysis. For various applications like flood management, ortho rectification of remote sensing images, navigation, architectural works, defence, etc., high resolution DEM is required. TanDEM-X mission was launched in 2010 to obtain high resolution global DEM with HTRI- 3 standard. SAR interferometry (InSAR) technique is used for DEM generation from TanDEM-X SAR data. The accuracy of DEM depends on many parameters like height ambiguity, incidence angle, polarization, etc. In this study, time series TanDEM-X data spanning over 3 years, had processed for generating DEM at the spatial resolution of 6 m and their accuracy had studied using DGPS elevation data and SRTM 90 m DEM.

Successful anastomoses were characterized by complete fusion of hyphal walls, protoplasm continuity and occurrence of nuclei in the middle of hyphal bridges.

Microscopic examinations detected hyphal incompatibility responses in diverse pairings, consisting of protoplasm retraction from the tips and septum formation in the approaching hyphae, even before physical contact with neighboring hyphae. Inter-estingly, many hyphal tips showed precontact tropism, suggesting that specific recognition signals may be involved during this stage.
