500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{reproductive}} habits of V. togata. A 2009 study, the first to focus on V. togata, conjectured that [...] "The high proportion of immature females obtained in the survey (76%) and the low proportion of mature females (10%) could indicate that the spawning season <b>is</b> <b>finishing</b> {{at the beginning of the}} autumn. Moreover, the wide size range of the sampled population, with a considerable number of small individuals (possibly only a few days old), suggests the existence of an extended reproduction period.". Analyzing the spermatophores and eggs of the captured specimens, the 2009 study found that V. togata had a low fecundity value, with females having large eggs and males producing a low number of large spermatophores (the largest reported of any deep-sea member of the suborder Incirrina). Despite this, the species was still one of the most fecund among [...] "deep-sea octopods that inhabit the Southern Ocean".|$|E
