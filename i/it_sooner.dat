500|$|In 1929, {{after leaving}} major league baseball, Coveleski {{relocated}} to South Bend, Indiana. There, he ran Coveleski Service Station for a time, but closed the business during the Great Depression. He became a popular {{member of the}} community in South Bend, providing free pitching lessons to local youths in a field behind his garage. After his playing career ended, he dropped the [...] "e" [...] {{at the end of his}} name, as he never corrected anyone if his last name was incorrectly spelled. In 1969, Coveleski was named to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans' Committee alongside 1920s pitcher Waite Hoyt. Of his introduction into the Hall he said, [...] "I figured I'd make <b>it</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, and I just kept hoping each year would be the one." [...] His health declined in later years, and he was eventually admitted to a local nursing home, where he died on March 20, 1984 at the age of 94.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for this album was more {{communal}} {{compared to that}} for Hello Master; Heppner had written much of the band's debut album himself and his bandmates helped him in arranging the material, but the sophomore album featured more contributions from each band member. Nudo once again wrote and sang a song for the record, and although Watchorn did not write the lyrics to an entire song by himself for this album, he and Heppner collaborated on several of them, including [...] "Lady Killer". Watchorn explained that the songs changed drastically between {{the time they were}} first written and when they got recorded, and that the songs [...] "weren't complete until they actually made the record." [...] He also said that the album's protracted production history enabled the group to experiment with the songs and repeatedly alter them to taste, thus ironically yielding a record that was considered better than if they had been able to simply record it and be done with <b>it</b> <b>sooner.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was not close, it was 7–2 on the principal {{issue of whether}} {{there had been a}} constitutional violation... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount? You're going to let it continue and come to a conclusion? And then overturn it? The reason to stop <b>it</b> <b>sooner</b> was not, [...] "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"... you forget what was going on at the time. We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film four stars {{out of four}} and said: [...] "The film offers one sensational {{sequence}} after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues." [...] Ebert also added, [...] "had I not been prevented from seeing <b>it</b> <b>sooner</b> because of an injury, {{this would have been}} on my year's best films list." [...] Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film five stars, writing: [...] "I can only say Django delivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, {{something to do with the}} manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable and delicious as a forbidden cigarette." [...] Writing in The New York Times, critic A. O. Scott compared Django to Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds: [...] "Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness." [...] Designating the film a Times [...] "critics" [...] pick, Scott said Django is [...] "a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism." [...] Filmmaker Michael Moore praised Django, tweeting that the movie [...] "is one of the best film satires ever. A rare American movie on slavery and the origins of our sick racist history." ...|$|E

[...] According to Auto Trader, the automaker planned to continue production {{until the second}} generation Ridgeline was introduced; however, [...] "slow sales of the truck have prompted the automaker to pull <b>it</b> <b>sooner</b> than expected." [...] Despite this, the Ridgeline was one of Honda's more profitable vehicles due to the company's frugal nature {{that allowed them to}} develop the Ridgeline for under $250 million U.S. dollars —half of what General Motors would normally pay—, maximizing Honda's profit margin.|$|E
