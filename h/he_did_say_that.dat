25|$|On March 29, 2017, the Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, {{said that}} after the team's {{upcoming}} game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos {{said that he was}} not going to put any dates on his return, however, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was very pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} this first {{collection}} said that Schröter's abilities for composing were not equal to her potential. The reviewer felt that the songs had much spirit in them, but were not written {{in a way that}} brought this out. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the performances of these pieces were helpful to understanding the depth of them. Ultimately, he blamed this deficiency on her lack of education, a real problem for women in this period of time.|$|E

25|$|At the Italian Grand Prix, Alonso {{was given}} a penalty for 'holding up' Massa during the final {{qualification}} session. Many in the Formula One 'paddock' were reported to disagree with the penalty and Max Mosley has since {{said that he would}} not have issued the same penalty as the race stewards. Schumacher reduced Alonso's lead to only two points after winning the race while Alonso suffered an engine failure in the late stages of the race. Despite a fourth-place finish for Alonso's teammate, Giancarlo Fisichella, and a flat-spotted tyre causing Felipe Massa to score no points, the race also saw Ferrari pull ahead of Renault {{for the first time in}} 2006. Polish driver Robert Kubica took his BMW Sauber to his first podium finish, in only his third race, but the race results were largely overshadowed by Schumacher announcing, during the post-race press conference, that he would retire at the end of the season. Afterwards <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he would hold a position in the Ferrari F1 team for 2007, though he did not disclose what.|$|E
25|$|By February 1, six Southern {{states had}} {{followed}} South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession, declaring themselves to {{no longer be}} a part of the United States. On February 18 Jefferson Davis was sworn in as the President of the Confederate States. Meanwhile, Washington was astir with talk of coups and conspiracies. Stanton thought that discord would ravage the capital on February 13, when electoral votes were being counted; nothing happened. Again, Stanton thought, when Lincoln was sworn in on March 4 there would be violence; this did not come to pass. Lincoln's inauguration did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not say he would outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful. In Stanton, Lincoln's words were met with cautious optimism. The new President submitted his choices for his cabinet on March 5, and by that day's end, Stanton was no longer the attorney general. He lingered in his office for a while to help settle in and guide his replacement, Edward Bates.|$|E

Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Alfred insisted that his judges be literate {{so that they could}} apply themselves [...] "to the pursuit of wisdom".

500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping." [...] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them [...] "more ponderous than sensational" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from [...] "From Russia, With Love" [...] or [...] "You Only Live Twice" [...] or [...] "The Spy Who Loved Me" [...] or [...] "Moonraker." [...] This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top." [...] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that [...] "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" [...] although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the film is [...] "slick entertainment" [...] with a tone that is [...] "consistently comic even when the material is not." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Matt Selman and directed by Nancy Kruse. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 27, 2002. The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is at the movie theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> one should eat a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These trivias were subsequently included in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Kylie had {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Chris True from AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, giving it a mixed review. He said [...] "While the production values on Kylie's debut are dated at best and the tunes are nothing but standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum, there are some rather endearing qualities to it. Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al." [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Minogue would become a pop star and a [...] "European icon". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. The stand out track, he said, was [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", as he said [...] "but anyone who denies 'I Should Be So Lucky' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab". He also finished saying [...] "The bog-standard S.A.W. production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover, and it's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread, but the little Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record's quintessentially '80s charm ultimately wins through." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{researcher}} from University College London {{says the}} lack of qualitative directories, {{and the fact that}} many support groups are not listed by search engines can make finding an appropriate group difficult. Even so, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the medical community needs [...] "to understand the use of personal experiences rather than an evidence-based approach... these groups also impact on how individuals use information. They can help people learn how to find and use information: for example, users swap Web sites and discuss Web sites." ...|$|R
500|$|During a {{press conference}} in Athens after the final, Kalomoira said that [...] "it was an honor... to {{represent}} Greece in this contest" [...] and thanked Greece because they supported her from the first moment she said she would compete. However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was the biggest thing that she has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in her life that will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to do so well in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the PSP port, Eric L. Patterson of Play {{was highly}} {{positive}} about the game's old-school mechanics {{and the chance to}} replay it with an improved localization and the Snow Queen route reinstated. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> for fans of the PlayStation 2 Persona games, [...] " [...] could very well feel like a punch to the face and a boot to the crotch." [...] Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, said that the way Persona broke away from RPG norms through the communication with demons during battle made it essential playing for fans of the genre. He was generally positive about most aspects apart from its visuals. Game Informers Joe Juba, despite noting awkward navigation and the inability to appreciate character and enemies designs due to their small sprite size, generally praised the game for improving on the original game's flaws. Ben Reeves, giving a second opinion on the game as part of the review, generally shared Juba's points of praise, though found the minimap inadequate. GameSpot's Lark Anderson was more critical than most, praising the story and improved localization, but finding the combat, navigation and graphics fairly dated compared to both recent and contemporary RPGs. IGN's Sam Bishop shared critiques about the graphics with other reviewers, but enjoyed most other parts of the game, and particularly appreciated the inclusion of the Snow Queen route. RPGamer's Glenn Wilson and RPGFan's Neal Chandran generally echoed other reviewers' sentiments: Wilson cited it as a less enjoyable game than the PlayStation 2 Persona entries while still being a quality project, and Chandran called it [...] "a killer trip down memory lane with a pair of high-definition rose-colored glasses." [...] Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was also awarded RPGFan's Editor's Choice Award.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the Bush tax cuts had {{generated}} more revenue, Laffer stated {{that he did not}} know.

5000|$|One {{question}} in dispute is whether Guanahani was one island {{or more than}} one. Evidence {{is said to be}} inconclusive. Columbus never <b>says</b> specifically <b>that</b> Guanahani consisted of more than one island, something which is surely worth noting. But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Guanahani had [...] "another part, which is the eastern part"; and to explore that eastern part, he used a boat rather than walking, which may be significant. On reproductions of the map by Juan de la Cosa, who was with Columbus, Guanahani looks to some researchers like a string of small islands.|$|R

Troubled by this, King Arthur agrees to leave on a hunting trip to give the knights a chance to catch the Queen with Lancelot, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if they are caught, he hopes that Lancelot will be able to kill all witnesses and adds that if the two fail in backing their claims, he will see to it that they are pursued by the law themselves.|$|R

In an interview with Ronald Bailey, published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} there are undoubtedly market failures in credit markets, and government does {{have a role in}} managing these market failures (and indeed supporting certain sectors), interest rate caps are ultimately an inefficient way of reaching the goal of lower long-term interest rates. This is because they address the symptom, not the cause of financial market failures. In order to bring down rates sustainably, it is likely that governments will need to act more systemically, addressing issues in market information and market structure and on the demand side and ultimately supporting a deeper level of financial sector reform.|$|R

2500|$|On November 26, 1784, the Holy See {{established}} the Apostolic Prefecture of the United States. Carroll, as Prefect Apostolic in February 1785, urged Cardinal Antonelli {{to create a}} method of appointing church authorities that would not make it appear {{as if they were}} receiving their appointment from a foreign power. A report of the status of Catholics in Maryland was appended to his letter, where he stated that despite there being only nineteen priests in Maryland, some of the more prominent families were still Catholic in faith. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they may have been prone to dancing and novel-reading.

2500|$|Two {{allegations}} were made against another Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe. The {{first to be}} made public involves a 1996 rafting trip Kolbe took on the Colorado River with two recently graduated, 17-year-old male pages, as well as Kolbe's sister, five of his staffers, and Gary Cummins, the deputy superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park at the time. An anonymous participant told NBC that he was [...] "creeped out" [...] by the attention Kolbe paid {{to one of the}} pages, adding that Kolbe did a lot of [...] "fawning, petting and touching" [...] on the teenager's arms, shoulders and back. The page in question declined to address that statement, telling NBC, [...] "I just don't want to get into this... because I might possibly be considered for a job in the administration." [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had a [...] "blast" [...] on the trip and did not report anything improper to his parents or page officials afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|According to an {{affidavit}} given in 1934 by Louis Darvarich, {{a friend of}} Whitehead, the two men made a motorized flight together of {{about half a mile}} in Pittsburgh's Schenley Park in April or May 1899. Darvarich said they flew at a height of [...] in a steam-powered monoplane aircraft and crashed into a brick building. Darvarich said he was stoking the boiler aboard the craft and was badly scalded in the accident, requiring several weeks in a hospital. Reportedly because of this incident, Whitehead was forbidden by the police to perform any more experiments in Pittsburgh. Aviation historian William F. Trimble, pointing to a lack of contemporary proof, dismissed this story in 1982 as a case of [...] "overactive imaginations." [...] Whitehead's stated control method– a shifting of body weight– was said by Trimble to be insufficient to control a powered aircraft, and the supposed charcoal-fired steam powerplant could not have been powerful enough to lift itself off the ground. The timing also seems inaccurate as Whitehead was quoted in December 1899 Pittsburgh papers as still constructing his plane, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had flown it in Boston.|$|E

50|$|Mayo {{contended that}} the effect {{was due to the}} workers {{reacting}} to the sympathy and interest of the observers. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this experiment is about testing overall effect, not testing factors separately. He also discusses it not really as an experimenter effect but as a management effect: how management can make workers perform differently because they feel differently. A lot to do with feeling free, not feeling supervised but more in control as a group. The experimental manipulations were important in convincing the workers to feel this way: that conditions were really different. The experiment was repeated with similar effects on mica-splitting workers.|$|R
