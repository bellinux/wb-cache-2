It was thought that concern over mad cow disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that <b>feed</b> <b>stock</b> at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil.

5000|$|Gas cracker: Petrochemicals {{are usually}} {{manufactured}} in large scale from petroleum <b>feed</b> <b>stocks</b> [...] Naphtha, natural gas, refinery off-gas and gas from cokers and thermal crackers are good sources. Thus {{natural gas is}} one of the most wanted <b>feed</b> <b>stocks</b> for petrochemicals production. The thermal craking of natural gas proceeds at very high temperature resulting in olefins (Mostly ethylene/propylene). The temperature in a gas cracker exceeds 1000°C. For ultimate decomposition of gas into elements more than 1500 °C is required. Thus, acetylene/carbon black production encounters such high temperatures. Usually oxy-combustion methods are used for attaining such high temperatures. BASF burners/Kellog burners are available in the market. Further electro cracking/ plasma cracking is also available (Dr.B.K.B. Rao).|$|R
