40|$|Interaction graphs are {{a useful}} tool to {{investigate}} graphically the influence of <b>feebacks</b> in dynamical systems modelling complex systems with many interacting components in a non-spatial context. In [14] and [15] the authors showed {{with the help of}} a multi-scale analysis that stochastic systems with infinite and finite degrees of freedom can be approximated by dynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination of ordinary differential equations and Markov chains. The leading order term in these dynamical systems is called average dynamics and turns out to be an adequate concept to analyse such systems with discrete and continuous state spaces. There are many complex systems that can be conveniently described inside such a state space setting, for example bio-molecular interactions. Both ODEs and Markov chains and their mutual interaction can be better understood and analysed through the introduction of the so called Interaction Graph, a concept originally invented for time-continuous dynamical systems [4]. In this paper the average dynamics is introduced as an heuristic tool to construct models of reaction networks with their qualitative properties explored in terms of connectivity properties of the Interaction Graphs for the ODEs, the Markov chain and the resulting average dynamics. In a second paper the question of stability, robustness and a possible modular structure of the complex system defined by the average dynamics is addressed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two 600 MWe {{reactors}} {{are compared}} regarding safety relevant reactivity coefficients, waste-burning capabilities and reactivity swings during burn-up. Furthermore, comparisons of unprotected Loss-of-Flow and Loss-of-Heat Sink calculations are presented. In {{the first part}} of this paper, oxide fuels with an inert 92 Mo matrix (occupying a 50 % volume fraction) are investigated. This CERMET fuel is considered to be significantly more stable than an MgO matrix-based CERCER fuel and the isotopic tailoring of molybdenum appears affordable. Manufacturing and reprocessing aspects of these new fuels are discussed in some detail. The LFR core under consideration is considerably larger than the SFR core and has a slightly higher average TRU enrichment (50. 0 to 43. 0 %). The LFR core is larger due to the larger pitch-to-diameter of 1. 5 compared to 1. 2 for SFR. By introducing additional pins with BeO moderator both cores show a negative Doppler that is larger than the positive coolant reactivity coefficient (LFR: Doppler – 50 pcm and 38 pcm coolant reactivity increase, SFR: – 54 and 36 pcm); reactivity coefficients refer to a 100 K heat-up. The burn-up swings for the BeO moderated core were – 12. 8 $ per year for the LFR and – 23. 8 $ for the SFR. The LFR burner can annually transmute over 300 kg of plutonium and MAs corresponding roughly to the annual production of the transuranics of a 1. 1 GWe LWR. Annual TRU consumption in the SFR burner is slightly less and equal to 263 kg. However, due to lower actinide inventory in the SFR, the actinide burn-up rate is larger than in the LFR. Another significant difference is in the safety behavior. The relatively large LFR overcomes the unprotected Loss-of-Flow due to its superior natural circulation whereas the SFR gets into sodium boiling. The latter may be avoided if fast negative structural <b>feebacks</b> could be proven to be large enough. In the unprotected Loss-of-Heat Sink accident the grace time of the LFR is considerably larger but for these longer times the lower grid expansion, which was not considered, would terminate the accidents. The use of thorium instead of the inert matrix appears to be quite attractive since 233 U is generated without producing new minor actinides. Thus, potentially, a good new LWR fuel would become available. The reactivity coefficients of such a core look also quite good: for the LFR core and ThZrH 1. 6 the Doppler is - 113 pcm and the coolant reactivity is 45 pcm. The burn-up swing is only about 0. 4 $ per year. The problem is the remote handling of the 233 U that is due to the presence of a hard gamma emitter from a descendent of 232 Th and also the 232 U alpha emission. However, since remote handling is also used for MOX fuel, there should be no principal problem for reprocessing and fabricating a 233 U / Th fuel. More studies are needed for the homogeneous burning of minor actinides in self-breeders, which in any case looks very promising. Finally, more detailed studies are required to further optimize core designs with respect to their fuel cycle performance, particularly for the SFR. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 24, 2014 - March 24, 2016 VCO-based ADCs have recently emerged as attractive alternative to conventional DeltaSigma (ΔΣ) modulator architectures. Few salient features of a VCObased ADC are: 1) the quantization noise is 1 st order noise shaped, 2) it is an open loop architecture, and, 3) its implementation is mostly digital in nature. Hence, they are ideally suited for oversampled data converter techniques with the capability to operate at near GHz frequencies. However, their performance is severely limited by the non-linearity of the voltage to frequency transfer curve. Also, when operating at GHz frequencies, the excess loop delay (ELD) of a continuous-time ΔΣ modulator can be a large fraction of the sampling period, thereby affecting the of stability of the modulator. In this work,two new architectures are proposed to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks. In the first approach,a continuous-time Delta Sigma modulator incorporates a non-linear VCO as the second stage in a 2 -stage residue canceling quantizer (RCQ) and mitigates the impact of its non-linearity by spanning only a small region of the VCOs tuning curve. In the second approach, both phase and frequency domain information are extracted from the VCO and fedback, which provides an extra clock cycle delay in the <b>feeback</b> path. This relaxes the timing constraints for the modulator, allowing it to be clocked at GHz frequencies...|$|E

The simulation software deals with systems of hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom and computes the reconfiguration of the molecules in a few tenths of a second. For the ease of manipulation and to help the operator understand nanoscale phenomena, a haptic device is connected to the simulator. To handle a wide variety of applications, both position and force control are implemented. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} the applications of force control are detailed for molecular simulation. These two control modes are compared in terms of adequacy with molecular dynamics, transparency and stability sensitivity with respect to environmental conditions.

40|$|One of {{the central}} goals of quantum optics is to {{generate}} large interactions between single photons. Light interacting with motion in an optomechanical system can sense minute fluctuations in displacement, and also impart a force via radiation pressure. Taken together, these two effects mean that two photons can "sense" each other's presence in an interaction mediated by motion. It is accepted that for an optomechanical system to mediate strong interactions between single photons, the mechanical system must respond before the photon is lost (ω_m > κ), and the radiation pressure force must generate a displacement large enough to change the optical properties of the system (g_ 0 > κ). The challenge of achieving this "vacuum strong coupling" has prevented experiments from demonstrating single-photon interactions. In this work we show that by adding a coherent feedback channel to a slow mechanical system (ω_m < κ) that is weakly nonlinear (g_ 0 < κ), two spatially separated single photons {{can be made to}} effectively interact with each other deterministically through the mechanical motion of a resonator. To numerically analyze our system, we must solve Schrödinger's equation for the state of an optomechanical system coupled to a long waveguide <b>feeback</b> channel. We implement a matrix product state approach to keep track of and evolve the complete quantum state of the system in an efficient way. We analyze the process semiclassically and then solve the full quantum dynamics numerically to find a cross-over between the semiclassical and quantum regimes of optomechanics. Finally we analyze the experimental prospects for implementing this protocol. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{approaches}} {{the different kinds}} of feedback that teachers in Spanish give to their secondary level students in Sweden. The purpose of the study is to investigate how feedback is perceived by students and how students would like feedback to be. Classical studies about assessment divide feedback into two categories: formative feedback and summative feedback. Our study intends, on the one hand, to analyze if students perceive receiving one of these kinds of feedback more than the other. On the other hand, the study intends to find out if students prefer summative or formative feedback. Furthermore, we aim to analyze if there is a link between the students´ perceptions and preferences and their level of proficiency in the Spanish language. The study was carried out with 190 students from Småland (Sweden) that were studying Spanish as a foreign language at school. We used questionnaires in order to gather information about the feedback they get in their Spanish lessons and the feedback they personally prefer. The results of the study show that students do perceive receiving more summative feedback than formative <b>feeback.</b> The students who perceive a higher reception of formative feedback are those who have a higher proficiency in Spanish, and this fact was proved to be statistically significant. The results of the study show as well that students like to get formative feedback as much as summative feedback. Nevertheless, the higher achivers do prefer getting formative feedback in a higher grade than the lower achievers, even though this could not be proved as statistically significant. ...|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{and control}} system design have {{traditionally}} been viewed as distinct, independent problems. Not all model characteristics, however, {{are relevant to the}} control system design problem. One can expect, then, that parsimonious, more effective controllers are possible if control considerations are incorporated in the modeling stage. The synergism of dynamic modeling and process control, as pertaining to the fields of low-order controller design, model reduction, and model identification, is investigated in this thesis. The guiding theoretical framework is the robust control paradigm using the Structured Singular Value, which addresses controller design in the presence of model uncertainty. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of a control-relevant model reduction methodology. The effectiveness of reduction is increased by incorporating the closed-loop performance/robustness specifications, plant uncertainties, and setpoint/disturbance characteristics explicitly as weights in the reduction procedure. The efficient computation of the control-relevant reduction problem is indicated and illustrated with examples taken from the control of a methanation reactor and a binary distillation column. A low-order controller design methodology for single-input, single-output plants is also presented. The basis for this methodology is the combination of the control-relevant reduction problem with the Internal Model Control (IMC) design procedure. The relationship between low-order IMC controllers and classical <b>feeback</b> compensators is examined. It is shown that for many models common to the process industries, the controllers obtained from the low-order compensator design technique are of the PID type. Finally, a model identification methodology is established using spectral time series analysis to obtain plant transfer function and uncertainty estimates directly from experiments. The control-relevant model reduction procedure can then be used to fit the "full-order" frequency response to a "reduced-order" parametric model. Model validation for control purposes is achieved by insuring that the robustness condition is satisfied. ...|$|E

Exposure of intestinal epithelial IEC- 18 cells to increasing concentrations of the PKD family inhibitor kb NB 142 - 70, at concentrations that inhibited PKD 1 activation, strikingly potentiated Akt phosphorylation at Thr(308) and Ser(473) {{in response to}} the mitogenic GPCR agonist angiotensin II (ANG II). Enhancement of Akt activation by kb NB 142 - 70 was also evident in cells with other GPCR agonists, including vasopressin and lysophosphatidic acid. Cell treatment with the structurally unrelated PKD family inhibitor CRT 0066101 increased Akt phosphorylation as potently as kb NB 142 - 70 [corrected]. Knockdown of PKD 1 with two different siRNAs strikingly enhanced Akt phosphorylation in response to ANG II stimulation in IEC- 18 cells. To determine whether treatment with kb NB 142 - 70 enhances accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) -trisphosphate (PIP 3) in the plasma membrane, we monitored the redistribution of Akt-pleckstrin homology domain-green fluorescent protein (Akt-PH-GFP) in single IEC- 18 cells. Exposure to kb NB 142 - 70 strikingly increased membrane accumulation of Akt-PH-GFP in response to ANG II. The translocation of the PIP 3 sensor to the plasma membrane and the phosphorylation of Akt was completed prevented by prior exposure to the class I p 110 α specific inhibitor A 66. ANG II markedly increased the phosphorylation of p 85 α detected by a PKD motif-specific antibody and enhanced the association of p 85 α with PTEN. Transgenic mice overexpressing PKD 1 showed a reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) in intestinal epithelial cells compared to wild type littermates.

Au tips with a smooth surface and a radius ranging from 10 - 30 nm were fabricated by electrochemical etching of Au wires at a constant potential {{in a mixture of}} fuming HCl and absolute ethanol with a volume ratio of 1 : 1. The ending point was monitored by a <b>feeback</b> control with a preset etching current smaller than the base current. The influence of the etching voltage on the sharpness and surface structure of the tips were systematically investigated and it was found that Au tips with a high quality could be obtained at an etching voltage of 2. 2 V versus Au wire. By comparing the current-time curves of the etching process and the SEM images of each individual tip, we found that the current-time curves recorded during the etching process could be effectively used to evaluate the possible quality of tips. A curve with a good periodicity at the ending point of etching process results in a tip with a good shape and sharp apex. As a consequence, {{it is not necessary to}} use SEM to characterize the tips in the future preparation of tips, which will not only improve the efficiency during the experiments but also avoid to a large extent any possible contamination.

Between 2005 and 2009 the survey data provided information about student attitudes to written assessment feedback (n= 261). From 2010 onwards the data relates to audio (mp 3) feedback (n= 102). The analysis of he interview data indicated that introducing audio feedback should be done with care. The perception of the participating lecturers was mixed, ranging from sceptism to outright enthusiasm, but over time the overall approach became positive. It was found that particular attention needs to be paid to small (but important) technical details, and lecturers need to be convinced of its effectieness, especially that it is not necessarily more time consuming than providing written feedback. 	For students, the analysis revealed a clear preference for audio feedback. It is concluded that there is cause for concern and reason for optimism. It is a cause for concern because there is a possibility that scepticism on the part of academic staff seems to be based on assumptions about what students prefer and a concern about using the technology. There is reason for optimism because the evidence points towards students preferring audio feedback and as academic staff become more familiar with the technology the scepticism tends to evaporate. While this study is limited in scope, questions are raised about tackling negative staff perceptions of audio feedback that are worthy of further research...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} dwarf galaxies is {{important}} {{in order to better}} understand the physics of the young universe and how larger galaxies form and evolve. In this work we focus on Blue Compact Galaxies (BCGs) which havemuch enhanced star formation (starbursts), causing blue colours and strong emission line spectra. Investigating of the inner motions of BCGs provides a means for determining masses and understanding what triggered the current starburst. We have used the Very Large Telescope to perform challenging observations of the stellar motions in several BCGs, as seen in the near-infrared Ca-triplet absorption lines. By comparing these to the kinematics of the ionized interstellar medium, we were able to look into the role of <b>feeback</b> from stellar winds and supernova explosions, as well as further strengthen the notion that the merging of galaxies plays an important role. Spatially resolved spectroscopy can yield information about the 3 D-structure of galaxies. We have used a Fabry-Perot interferometer to study the kinematics of the interstellar medium in two samples of galaxies, each containing about twenty objects. We find strong indications for ongoing galaxy mergers that correlate well with the strength of the star-formation activity. Furthermore, by estimating dynamical masses, BCGs are shown to be on average not dynamically supported by rotation. In addition, we have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the frequency of starbursts in the local universe and the connection to their descendants. We selected starbursts by the strength of emission in H-alpha, the first Balmer recombination line, and post-starbursts by the strength of absorption in H-delta. These are indicators of currently ongoing and recent, on the order of 100 Myr, star-formation, respectively. By modelling the stellar populations we derive ages and masses and can establish a link between starbursts and postbursts in a time sequence. We find that starbursts are active on a 100 Myr timescale but are rare objects in the local universe...|$|E
40|$|From Introduction] This is {{the first}} formal {{research}} report published by Rhodes University in this format. Each Department’s/Faculty’s highlights have been included as provided by the Head of Department {{as well as the}} research outputs produced. In addition, a table of provisional subsidy units earned by each Department/Faculty have been included as there is often a misconception that one journal article equates to one subsidy unit. This is the case if all the authors are from Rhodes University but where joint articles are written, a pro-rata share is calculated. Likewise due to the complex funding formula calculated by the Department of Education, the total research outputs produced do not equate directly to the subsidisable units. Please note that "in press" articles in 2001 but published in 2002 have already been claimed in 2001 and hence will not appear in the table but are recorded in the report. Articles that have been submitted for possible publication have not been included in the table nor the report as {{there is no way of}} proving that the articles have been accepted for publication by the time our submission to the Department of Education was audited. Also please note that subsidy units earned for book/chapter/patent/conference proceedings publications are not included in the subsidy unit tables since we receive no <b>feeback</b> from the Department of Education in terms of which books/chapters/patents/proceedings are finally accepted for subsidy purposes each year. Only a small fraction of such books, chapters, patents and proceedings which are submitted actually receive subsidy. I would like to stress the need to publish in subsidisable journals and submit accurate information so that the University can claim as many units as possible. The total audited (but not yet awarded) publication subsidy units for journal articles which have been submitted to the Department of Education for 2002 is 206. 64 units. The average number of units awarded for the past three years (1999 - 2001) was 205. 35 units. Based on past performance, the University can expect to earn an additional ± 11. 85 subsidy units for book, chapters, patents and proceedings publications in 2002. Publications in current non-subsidy earning journals in 2002 amounted to 16. 00 units. These have been forwarded to the Department of Education for consideration for subsidy purposes. Finally, I would like to add my congratulations to that of the Vice-Chancellor to all staff and postgraduate students for their research efforts in 2002...|$|E
40|$|The Notch {{signalling}} pathway is pivotal {{in ensuring}} that the processes of arterial specification, angiogenic sprouting and haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification are correctly {{carried out in the}} dorsal aorta (DA), a primary arterial blood vessel in developing vertebrate embryos. Using the zebrafish as a model organism, and additional experimental observations from mouse and cell line models to guide mathematical modelling, this thesis aims to better understand the mechanisms involved in the establishment of a healthy vasculature in the growing embryo. We begin by studying arterial and HSC specification in the zebrafish DA. Mathematical models are used to analyse the dose response of arterial and HSC genes to an input Notch signal. The models determine how distinct levels of Notch signalling may be required to establish arterial and HSC identity. Furthermore, we explore how Delta-Notch coupling, which generates salt-and-pepper patterns, may drive the average gene expression levels higher than their homogeneous levels. The models considered here can qualitatively reproduce experimental observations. Using laboratory experiments, I was able to isolate DA cells from transgenic zebrafish embryos and generate temporal gene expression data using qPCR. We show {{that it is possible to}} fit ODE models to such data but more reliable data and a greater number of replicates at each time point is required to make further progress. The same VEGF-Delta-Notch signalling pathway is involved in tip cell selection in angiogenic sprouting. Using an ODE model, we rigourously study the dynamics of a VEGF-Delta-Notch feedback loop which is capable of amplifying differences betwen cells to form period- 2 spatial patterns of alternating tip and stalk cells. The analysis predicts that the <b>feeback</b> strengths of Delta ligand and VEGFR- 2 production dictate the onset of patterning in the same way, irrespective of the parameter values used. This model is extended to incorporate feedback from filopodia, growing in a gradient of extracellular VEGF, which are capable of facilitating tip cell selection by amplifying the resulting patterns. Lastly, we develop a PDE model which is able to properly account for VEGF receptor distributions in the cell membrane and filopodia. Receptors can diffuse and be advected due to domain growth, defined by a constitutive law, in this model. Our analysis and simulations predict that when receptor diffusivity is large, the ODE model for filopodia growth is an excellent approximation to the PDE model, but that for smaller diffusivity, the PDE model provides valuable insight into the pattern forming potential of the system...|$|E

Thesis : Postgraduate Program Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. Thesis : Postgraduate Program Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. The {{purposes}} of this research are to make critical process of the money laundering evidence policy based on the Law Formulation Theory, and knowing consequence and proving implication with two evidence system, knowing a weakness and the money loundry evidence system excess. This thesis research type is doctrinal or normative research based on the second concept of the law from Soetandyo Wignyosoebroto. The research character is diagnostic. The data analysis applies qualitative analysis with using the logic principle, systematic, and juridict. Based on {{the description of the}} research result and related to the case studied, it can be concluded (a) The formulation of the money laundering evidence policy on the law of Money Laundering is to fill formulation of the law formation, but in input have an obstruction is no <b>feeback</b> is out comes acheaved who will be result, because the law of money laundry is too dominated by politic component as the main component, and not too pay attention for economic component in this thing is a disadvantages of country as the effect of money laundry. In the rule formulation must to pay attention philosophy aspect, sosiologic and juridict so in the performing level can be create of the law purpose. (b) the consequence and implication from there be equation and distinctive of the arrangement evidenced between The Penal Procedural Act and the law of money laundry at the rule in section 184 of The Penal Procedural Act. There is even in contrast is that in the Penal Procedural Act is unsystematized probe system flips over and electronic prove tool that constitutes a proof tool extension in the Penal Procedural Act. (c) In term of evidence the money laundry have a weakness as be equalled electronic proof tool force equalised with directions evidence tool so get easily be ruled out by other prove tool corresponds at the rule in section 184 of The Penal Procedural Act. Meanwhile in reverse probe to be gotten weakness because marks sense retroaktif's ground, at the law principle is may not retroactive, its reducing is electronic proof tool arrangement, jurisdictional enforcer is not understand the way of konfrehensif about the evidence, and also bended on the evidence with bureaucracy system and fictitious mail about asset wealth who one will validate and may used as mail evidence tool...|$|E
