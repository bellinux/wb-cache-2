40|$|Memory {{formation}} is a temporally graded process during which transcription and translation steps are {{required in the}} first hours after acquisition. Although persistence is a key characteristic of memory storage, its mechanisms are scarcely characterized. Here, we show that long-lasting but not short-lived inhibitory avoidance long-term memory {{is associated with a}} delayed expression of c-Fos in the hippocampus. Importantly, this late wave of c-Fos is necessary for maintenance of inhibitory avoidance long-term storage. Moreover, inhibition of transcription in the dorsal hippocampus 24 h after training <b>hinders</b> <b>persistence</b> but not formation of long-term storage. These findings indicate that a delayed phase of transcription is essential for maintenance of a hippocampus-dependent memory trace. Our results support the hypothesis that recurrent rounds of consolidation-like events take place late after learning in the dorsal hippocampus to maintain memories...|$|E

This article presents findings from a qualitative case study, which explored {{the phenomenon of}} undergraduate and graduate women learners’ persistence in online degree-completion programs at a college in the Northeast of the United States. Research questions asked why women learners persisted or failed to persist, and how factors supporting or <b>hindering</b> <b>persistence</b> influenced learners. Interviews with a purposeful sample of 20 participants revealed the complexity of variables affecting learners’ persistence to graduation. Findings suggested that multiple responsibilities, insufficient interaction with faculty, technology, and coursework ranked highest as barriers to women’s persistence. Strong motivation to complete degrees, engagement in the learning community, and appreciation {{for the convenience of}} an online degree-completion option facilitated persistence...|$|R

Low-income students earn bachelor's degrees at significantly lower rates than their high-income peers. This qualitative study interviewed 21 Fall 2008 full-time first-year Pell Grant recipients in May 2012 when almost all were near {{the point of}} baccalaureate degree completion at a large urban doctoral-granting institution with very high research activity. The Persistence Pyramid was a conceptual framework created by the author to organize the previous persistence research into four thematic areas related to individual student factors that affect persistence, and four thematic areas related to campus-based environmental factors that affect persistence. The four student areas include economic, social, psychological, and academic factors. The four campus factor areas include educational and curricular support, support for diversity and community, involvement opportunities, and a caring culture. The Persistence Pyramid was employed as a lens to ascertain which factors have {{the greatest impact on}} persistence from the perspective of successful low-income students. The study utilized a case study approach to illustrate how various factors interacted with each other to enhance <b>persistence,</b> <b>hinder</b> <b>persistence,</b> or mute negative risk factors. The Persistence Pyramid was a useful framework for illuminating which themes were most salient to the persistence of low-income students. The persistence factors related to economics were the most prevalent and had the greatest effect, potentially negative, on students' persistence. These economic factors also interacted the most with other persistence factors, often preventing the full utilization of persistence enhancers that students could have employed to their advantage. Seven other factor areas in the Persistence Pyramid were found to be relevant and all had particular themes of persistence that illustrated factors that helped or <b>hindered</b> <b>persistence</b> for low-income students. Two particular themes emerged as especially helpful in students' ability to persist. Under the social area, relying on friends for emotional support and academic assistance was especially useful for these students. Under the involvement area, over three-fourths of students served as a mentor or tutor and most of these students indicated that this experience {{was one of the most}} beneficial in improving their ability to persist to degree completion. Employing a pragmatic perspective, this study has numerous implications for recommendations to improve the baccalaureate attainment rate for low-income students. Suggestions for increasing baccalaureate degree attainment for low-income students include: Institutions could provide low-income students with campus jobs that will build career-specific skills. Institutions could develop programs to ensure that all students have a mentor and serve as a mentor. Student-service personnel could develop ways for students to utilize campus resources and support services earlier in their college careers. Students could ensure that they take advantage of numerous involvement opportunities, especially serving as a mentor or tutor. Students could make an effort to establish deep friendships and provide emotional support and encouragement to each other. Students could spend time studying with friends and classmates and serving as academic resources for each other...|$|R
30|$|Changing {{numbers of}} trees and shrubs can {{have a variety of}} {{consequences}} for native flora and fauna. Trees and shrubs provide essential habitat structure in the savanna landscape—for example, they provide perches and nest sites for birds (Ogada et al. 2008), food and domicile for insects, spiders, and invertebrates (Pringle et al. 2007), and a sheltered, nutrient-enriched habitat for a variety of understory plants. In the KLEE system, we have demonstrated that lower densities of a common shrub, Cadaba farinosa, are associated with lower abundances in several common butterfly species in the genus Colotis, whose adults and larvae specialize on Capparaceae (M. L. Wilkerson and T. P. Young unpublished data). Thus, an increase in trees and shrubs may be beneficial for overall ecosystem species diversity—up to a point. A very high density of woody vegetation, conversely, is likely to <b>hinder</b> the <b>persistence</b> of species that rely on open, grassy areas.|$|R
40|$|Therapies {{based on}} the {{impairment}} of reconsolidation or the enhancement of extinction offer the possibility of decreasing the persistent recollection of distressing memories. However, the direct interplay between reconsolidation and extinction has rarely been considered. Previously, we reported that reactivation induces reconsolidation of fear extinction memory. Here, using a step-down inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm in rats, we show that intrahippocampus infusion of function-blocking anti-BDNF antibody immediately or 6 h after extinction memory reactivation impairs the reconsolidation of extinction. Extinction memory reactivation increases proBDNF, BDNF, and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation levels in dorsal CA 1, while blocking BDNF maturation in the hippocampus with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 <b>hinders</b> the <b>persistence</b> of extinction and induces the recurrence of fear. Moreover, coinfusion of recombinant BDNF (0. 25 g/side) after extinction memory reactivation impedes {{the recovery of the}} avoidance response induced by inhibiting gene expression and protein synthesis in the dorsal hippocampus. Our findings unravel a new role for BDNF, suggesting that this neurotrophin is necessary and sufficient to maintain the reactivated fear extinction engram...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{study was to explore}} African-American women's perceptions of undergraduate STEM classroom experiences, {{and the ways in which}} those experiences have supported or <b>hindered</b> their <b>persistence</b> in physics majors. The major research question guiding this study was: How do African-American women perceive the climate and interactions with peers and faculty in undergraduate STEM classrooms? Using qualitative methods and a multiple case study design, a sample of 11 women were interviewed. This study was also informed by data from 31 African-American women who participated in focus group interviews at annual meetings of the National Society of Black and Hispanic Physicists. Findings indicated that the women excelled in small courses with faculty who took a personal interest in their success. They also perceived that there was a pervasive culture in physics and other STEM departments that often conflicted with their own worldviews. Findings also indicated that the women's perceptions of classroom experiences varied widely depending on professors' behaviors, institution types, and the level of courses. It is anticipated that through a better understanding of their perceptions of STEM learning environments and factors in their persistence, STEM faculty and departments can better retain and support this population of students...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} ethnographic study of institutional, ideological, and cultural factors influencing the educational pathways of low-income Latino/a students. The study lasted for nine months, and research was conducted in two field sites: {{a public high school}} and a public university in the Southwest. There were eighteen research participants [...] seventeen students and one teacher. A funds of knowledge approach combined with a Latino/a Critical Theory lens and best practices in college access allow a consideration of these factors in public schooling. I balanced institutional data with interviews, writing samples, and class discussions, and I found that factors <b>hindering</b> students' <b>persistence</b> included material conditions such as overcrowding, ideological constraints such as low expectations, and a cultural disconnect between students' values and the values embedded in school curricula and policies. Although these Latino/a students demonstrate experiential critical literacy, the students are not given an opportunity to connect their lived experiences to theory in school, which can hinder college-going attitudes. To foster critical democracy, practitioners of First-Year Composition have an opportunity to rethink our purpose and goals to make sure that what we advocate in theory [...] college persistence for all students [...] matches up with our practice. This study suggests remedies to ensure that in a system in which social, economic, and political inequities are fed by and feed our inequitable educational system, we can {{take an active role in}} reshaping the educational pipeline by working in partnership with public schools and communities to bring equity to college access and retention efforts...|$|R
40|$|HIV- 1 {{persists}} in a latent reservoir (LR) despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) 1 – 5. This reservoir {{is the major}} barrier to HIV- 1 eradication 6, 7. Current approaches to purging the LR involve pharmacologic induction of HIV- 1 transcription and subsequent killing of infected cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) or viral cytopathic effects 8 – 10. Agents that reverse latency without activating T cells have been identified using in vitro models of latency. However, their effects on latently infected cells from infected individuals remain largely unknown. Using a novel ex vivo assay, we demonstrate {{that none of the}} latency reversing agents (LRAs) tested induced outgrowth of HIV- 1 from the LR of patients on ART. Using a novel RT-qPCR assay specific for all HIV- 1 mRNAs, we demonstrate that LRAs that do not cause T cell activation do not induce significant increases in intracellular HIV- 1 mRNA in patient cells; only the PKC agonist bryostatin- 1 caused substantial increases. These findings demonstrate that current in vitro models do not fully recapitulate mechanisms governing HIV- 1 latency in vivo. Further, our data indicate that non-activating LRAs are unlikely to drive the elimination of the LR in vivo when administered individually. HIV- 1 cure is <b>hindered</b> by viral <b>persistence</b> in a small fraction (~ 1 / 106) of resting CD 4 +...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{forests in}} the Solomon Islands have been heavily logged in the last century. However, {{little is known about}} forest {{recovery}} dynamics across this region. Extrapolating findings from logged forests in tropical mainlands or large continental landbridge islands to isolated archipelagos such as the Solomons is inappropriate because succession and diversification patterns and processes differ between the former and latter. We compared the taxonomic diversity and composition of trees between unlogged forest and sites that were logged 10, 30 and 50 years previously to provide an indication of the potential dynamics of these forests following timber harvesting. The distance to logging roads and to unlogged forest influenced post-logging recovery, emphasising the importance of edge effects in previously logged forests. At least in the first 50 years after logging, tree-community composition did not appear to converge toward that in unlogged forests over time. Although species assemblages in logged forests generally tend to shift from light demanding-pioneers to old-growth species over time, a long-lived pioneer Campnosperma brevipetiolata dominated the forest even 50 years after logging. We suggest that recovery of the tree community in logged forests has been <b>hindered</b> by the <b>persistence</b> of C. brevipetiolata, and suggest that it could be thinned via careful silviculture techniques to enhance growth of mature-phase forest species. Removal of such persistent, long-lived pioneer trees could potentially help to accelerate recovery of heavily logged forests...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{the issue}} of {{regional}} disparities has become a highly debated topic, knowledge regarding regional disparities being a matter of political priority as their <b>persistence</b> <b>hinders</b> the appropriate integration process. On the other hand, emphasis was put on integration {{through the process of}} EU enlargement, thus highlighting other issues related to the nature and size of disparities. Regional disparities regarding development and the living standards of the population have long been the concern of all Member States. In the case of Romania, recently admitted into the European structures, registering large backlogs to economically developed countries, the intense mobilization of internal and external factors of economic growth in order to reduce and eliminate disparities compared to other countries, represents a clear necessity. The "European Union" (EU) project is of an unprecedented complexity and scale because it involves a plurality of states, which are culturally and economically heterogeneous. Moreover, these economic and cultural differences exist even within the states. Hence, there is also the central idea of the Union, regarding unity in diversity. In Romania the local, regional communities have a strong identity, but still evolving. Taking into account Romania's objective of successfully integrating into European structures, and the principles of democratic decision-making requires that regional development should aim at reducing economic and social disparities based on a notable involvement of the local, regional communities. Based on these facts, the paper aims to present the current regional (and intra-regional) disparities in Romania with regard to a number of synthetic indicators of capital, of labor and of outcomes. The persistence in time of these economic disparities can be explained by considering the cultural legacies – represented by norms, values, institutions, that impact on how people interact, communicate, investigate, think, consult, negotiate and act, influencing the behavior at community / society level...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{investigations into}} methodologies {{that can be}} applied to overcome imaging problems associated with carbonate minerals on scanning electron microscope-based cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) systems. The problem arises due to the persistent nature of luminescence from carbonate minerals, which causes ghosting or streaking across SEM-CL images. Two methodologies were tested: • The first methodology (Lee 2000) applied very long image acquisition times that, in certain situations proved capable of producing excellent images at higher resolution than is possible using optical-based CL systems. However, the image acquisition times are too slow (c. 40 minutes per image) to be useful in most day-to-day situations. • The second methodology (Reed and Milliken 2003) uses an optical filter to remove the portion of the CL spectrum responsible for the persistent luminescence (in this case in the yellow to red portion of the visible light spectrum). This enabled capture of SEM-CL images at far faster acquisition times (c. 5 minutes per image) than was possible without the filter. However, the resulting ‘filtered’ images suffer from relatively poor contrast and zoning apparent in these images did not always match zoning observed in optical Cl or unfiltered SEM-CL images. Poor image contrast was observed in the filtered images because the luminescence in the studied carbonates is predominantly due to activation by substitution of Mn, which predominantly occurs in the orange to red portion of the visible spectrum. Therefore, this type of luminescence was effectively excluded by the filter. Consequently the measured signals from the detector reflect the much less intense intrinsic luminescence of the carbonate or luminescence activated by other substituted cations (e. g. rare earth elements) or thermally activated luminescence. Although filtered SEM-CL carbonate imaging met with variable levels of success, the filtered imaging approach will prove useful in the SEM-CL analysis of quartz in mixed quartz-carbonate-bearing lithologies such as carbonate-cemented sandstones, which have previously been <b>hindered</b> by the <b>persistence</b> of the luminescence from the carbonates...|$|R
40|$|This report {{seeks to}} provide a {{portrait}} of schools serving rural communities in northwest China, and {{to shed light on}} factors that encourage and discourage school persistence among children in this region. To achieve these goals, we analyze a survey of rural children and their families, schools, and teachers in Gansu province. The project interviewed children in the year 2000, when children were 9 to 12 years old, and again four years later. In part one of the paper, we provide a descriptive overview of the material, human, and cultural resources available in sampled primary and middle schools. Where possible, we note changes between 2000 and 2004. We describe the following types of resources: (1) basic facilities; (2) financial arrangements; (3) teachers, including their background, qualifications, working lives, professional development activities, satisfaction with work, and attitudes about school management and culture; and (4) classroom environments, as reported by teachers and by students. In this descriptive section of the paper, we highlight basic infrastructure issues, the complexity of financial arrangements {{at the time of the}} surveys, problems of teacher wage arrears and teacher morale, and the pedagogies and learning environments in classrooms, as reported by teachers and students. In part two of the paper, we investigate reasons for school leaving reported by village leaders, families, and children themselves, and analyze contributors to subsequent enrollment, change in attainment, and attainment of nine years of compulsory education. Our models of family, teacher, and school effects on outcomes show that higher socio-economic status children are more likely to show grade attainment, continued enrollment, and attainment of nine years of basic education. In contrast, the gender story is mixed: girls are less likely to be enrolled, but have not gained less grades, nor are they less likely to achieve nine years of education. This finding suggests that boys may start later or repeat more. It is possible that boys are more likely to be encouraged to repeat a grade to complete it successfully or to increase high school exam scores. One significant finding is that the introduction of school and teacher effects, by and large, does not explain away the advantages of children in better off families. School and teacher effects do not consistently matter across the three outcomes. Some interesting findings include that teacher absenteeism in 2000 is associated with less attainment between 2000 and 2004; children with better-paid home room teachers are more likely to attain nine years of school; and children in schools with minban teachers are less likely to attain nine years. However, there is not a consistent story of school characteristics that help or <b>hinder</b> childrenʹs <b>persistence.</b> Reports by village-leaders, fathers, mothers, and children themselves indicate that, along with socioeconomic status, children 2 ̆ 7 s performance and engagement are significant factors in school continuation decisions in Gansu 2 ̆ 7 s rural villages.

40|$|Actorness in {{international}} affairs is traditionally held to be the preserve of states and based ultimately on the possession of military power. The EU challenges this assumption from two perspectives. Firstly, {{it is not a}} state and does not dispose directly over the conventional instruments of state power, but instead relies on cooperation among its member states. Secondly, the EU purports to be a different kind of actor, its power deriving from economic rather than military strength, and its approach to international relations based on the pursuit and transmission of certain norms of behaviour. To avoid a state-centric definition of actorness, this thesis focusses on the ability of the EU and its member states to reach consensus on external action issues, and uses this as the best measure of EU actorness. Existing theorizing on EU unity-formation is critiqued. Liberal intergovernmentalism assumes member states bargain over predetermined national interests that arise through a process of aggregation of sectoral economic interests, a shortcoming which is exposed in circumstances when economic outcomes are contested or difficult to predict, as is frequently the case for external action issues. Sociological institutionalism considers the socialisation of national political elites into common European norms of decision-making to be the driver of EU policy consensus-making, neglecting the significance of the Europeanization of national public spheres as a whole. To address these shortcomings an alternative theoretical approach is presented, derived from post-structuralism and discourse theory, which describes how EU policy unity is constrained by the interaction between domestic politics and public identity discourses at the member state level. This discourse-theoretical model is then tested on EU case studies representing a range of dimensions of actorness, including economic, environmental, military and normative actorness. The discourse-theoretical model is found to provide better explanations of the case studies than existing theories. The application of this model to the case studies yields a number of conclusions, including that EU actorness is <b>hindered</b> by the <b>persistence</b> of national constructions of economic questions, that EU actorness is often contingent on collaboration with the US, but that {{this is consistent with the}} key EU norm of multilateralism, and that the EU is potentially a more successful normative actor when pursuing norms of interstate relations, than regarding the norms of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine matriculating freshmen who worked on-campus during the fall {{semester}} of 1991 to see if they persisted in greater rates than similar students who did not work on-campus. This project also provided a profile of freshmen students who worked on-campus during fall semester of 1991. The project consisted of freshmen (N= 3, 578) who matriculated at Ball State University during the fall semester of 1991. In response to the research questions, two sub-groups were defined. The first group consisted of 477 Ball State University freshmen matriculates that worked on-campus during the fall semester of 1991. The second group consisted of the remaining 3, 101 Ball State University freshmen matriculates that did not work on-campus during the fall semester of 1991. Nearly 93 percent of the freshmen matriculates working on-campus during the fall semester of 1991 returned for spring semester 1992 while 90. 9 percent of non-workers returned for the second semester of their freshman year. Workers returned for the fall semester of 1992 at a rate of 78 percent, compared to 77. 3 percent of non-workers. Nearly 66 percent of non-workers returned for a third year while the workers returned at a rate of 67. 2 percent. In the fall of 1994, nearly 62 percent of workers returned for the fourth year of study while 59. 9 percent of non-workers returned. Returning for a fifth year of study was 42. 9 percent of those who worked on-campus as first semester freshmen as compared to 44 percent of non-workers. Those who worked on-campus, and had not yet earned a degree, returned at a rate of 18. 4 percent for fall semester 1996. Nearly 18 percent of the non-workers returned for a sixth year at Ball State University. The proportion of workers and non-workers who got a degree by July, 1997, was similar for freshmen matriculating in the fall of 1991. Overall, 53. 4 percent of freshmen matriculating in the fall semester of 1991 earned either an associate or baccalaureate degree by conclusion of the summer semester of 1997. Fifty-six percent of the 1991 freshmen matriculating class who worked on-campus graduated within six years compared to 53 percent of non-workers. The findings indicated that working on-campus as a matriculating freshman does not <b>hinder</b> students' academic <b>persistence</b> from fall to spring of their first year or year to year thereafter. Also, working on-campus does not reduce students' academic persistence to graduation. Department of Secondary, Higher, and Foundations of EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} EphA 2 is overexpressed in breast cancer and {{is regarded as a}} potential target for breast cancer therapeutics. Human adenovirus vector serotype 5 (HAd 5) -mediated EphrinA 1, the EphA 2 ligand, expression inhibited growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and a single intratumoral (i. t.) inoculation partially reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Recombinant HAd vectors, in general, are widely used gene delivery vehicles for pre-clinical investigations due to the ease of inserting transgenes into their genome coupled with a relatively high gene expression and purified vector manufacturing capability. However, the presence of pre-existing immunity in human population limits the use of HAd 5 vectors for clinical applications. To circumvent this limitation, a bovine adenovirus vector (BAd 3) has been developed and it retains most of the attributes of HAd 5. Furthermore, no pre-existing immunity against BAd 3 is prevalent in human population and BAd 3 or HAd 5 immune responses are not cross-neutralizing. To determine the usability of these vectors for breast cancer therapy after i. t. inoculations we investigated in an immunocompetent FVB/n mouse model of breast cancer the following; 1) a comparative biodistribution, persistence, transgene (green fluorescent protein/GFP) expression and safety of BAd 3 and HAd 5 vectors in the absence or presence of a pre-existing immune response, 2) in vitro mechanism/s of EphrinA 1 -mediated inhibition of EphA 2 overexpressing breast cancer cells using an HAd 5 vector expressing EphrinA 1 (HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc), and 3) in vivo antitumor effects of multiple inoculations of HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc alone or in combination with an immunostimulatory molecule, FMS-like tyrosine kinase ligand (Flt 3 L). First, after i. t. inoculations, the BAd 3 vector incorporating the GFP transgene (BAd-GFP) was not affected by the presence of transgene and efficiently transduced the tumors and persisted at least for 16 days. The vector also spread to the spleen, kidneys, liver, lungs and heart but revealed an altered distribution and gene expression pattern compared to HAd-GFP. The HAd-GFP vector immunity did not <b>hinder</b> the BAd-GFP <b>persistence</b> and transgene expression in the tumors and vice versa; however, the homologous vector immunity was associated with a rapid clearance and reduction in transgene expression. The histopathological alterations were comparable with HAd-GFP and BAd-GFP vectors {{with the exception of a}} transient rise in hepatic enzymes with BAd-GFP, however, with repeat inoculations, HAd-GFP treated mice revealed enhanced inflammatory changes compared to BAd-GFP or control groups. Secondly, infection of human or murine breast cancer cells with HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc was observed to be cytotoxic as it reduced the breast cancer cell viability, caused cellular rounding, nuclear condensation and induced apoptotic cell death as evidenced by an increase in Annexin V staining, enhanced tumor necrosis factor gene expression and reduction in Bcl 2 family protein expression. The apoptotic cell death was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by the cleavage of executioner caspase 3 of apoptotic pathway and cleavage of DNA damage repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase. Thirdly, we tested the anti-tumor effects of multiple inoculations of HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc alone or along with HAd-Flt 3 L in pre-established (non-palpable) or established (palpable) tumors and compared it with single i. t. inoculation in the mouse model. A significant reduction in tumor progression was evident with three inoculation of HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc in the pre-established tumors. The combination of HAd-EphrinA 1 -Fc with HAd-Flt 3 L further reduced but did not completely eliminate the progression of the established tumors. This effect correlated with the development of an adaptive immune response in the responding mice. Taken together, our results support further development of BAd 3 vector for breast cancer gene therapy to overcome pre-existing immune response. It seems EphA 2 -EphrinA 1 interaction accompanied by immunotherapy to enhance anti-tumor responses is a promising approach for breast cancer therapeutics. ...|$|R
