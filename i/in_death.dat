However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine {{consistency}} <b>in</b> injury <b>death</b> statistics from the United States CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) with those from GBD 2015 estimates. Methods: Differences <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> and the percent difference <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> between GBD 2015 and CDC WONDER were assessed, as were changes <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> between 2000 and 2015 for the two datasets. Results: From 2000 to 2015, GBD 2015 estimates for the U. S. injury deaths were somewhat higher than CDC WONDER estimates in most categories, with the exception of deaths from falls and from forces of nature, war, and legal intervention in 2015. Encouragingly, the difference <b>in</b> total injury <b>deaths</b> between the two data sources narrowed from 44, 897 (percent difference <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> = 41 %) in 2000 to 34, 877 (percent difference <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> = 25 %) in 2015. Differences <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> and percent difference <b>in</b> <b>deaths</b> between the two data sources varied greatly across injury cause and over the assessment years. The two data sources present consistent changes in direction from 2000 to 2015 for all injury causes except for forces of nature, war, and legal intervention, and adverse effects of medical treatment. Conclusions: We conclude that further studies are warranted to interpret the inconsistencies in data and develop estimation approaches that increase the consistency of the two datasets...|$|R

5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range <b>in</b> <b>Death</b> Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} shortcut to Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered <b>in</b> <b>Death</b> Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.|$|E

5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite {{are also in the}} complex (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains <b>in</b> <b>Death</b> Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result <b>in</b> <b>death.</b> Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E

5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting <b>in</b> <b>death</b> of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted <b>in</b> <b>death.</b> Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order.

The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even <b>in</b> <b>death.</b> Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E

5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result <b>in</b> <b>death,</b> but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
