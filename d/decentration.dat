MethodsA comprehensive model, which directly considers eye movements, including saccades, vestibular, optokinetic, vergence, and miniature, as well as, eye-tracker acquisition rate, eye-tracker latency time, scanner positioning time, laser firing rate, and laser trigger delay have been developed. ResultsEye-tracker acquisition rates below 100 Hz correspond to pulse positioning errors above 1. 5 mm. Eye-tracker latency times to about 15 ms correspond to pulse positioning errors of up to 3. 5 mm. Scanner positioning times to about 9 ms correspond to pulse positioning errors of up to 2 mm. Laser firing rates faster than eye-tracker acquisition rates basically duplicate pulse-positioning errors. Laser trigger delays to about 300 μs have minor to no impact on pulse-positioning errors. ConclusionsThe proposed model {{can be used for}} comparison of laser systems used for ablation processes. Due to the pseudo-random nature of eye movements, positioning errors of single pulses are much larger than observed <b>decentrations</b> in the clinical settings. There is no single parameter that ‘alone’ minimizes the positioning error. It is the optimal combination of the several parameters that minimizes the error. The results of this analysis are important to understand the limitations of correcting very irregular ablation patterns...|$|R

40|$|Cataract, a {{clouding}} of the crystalline eye lens, is {{the leading}} cause of blindness. It can effectively be treated by cataract surgery, where the clouded lens is replaced by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Postoperative healing processes can cause a displacement of the IOL, which further leads to the fact that the quality of vision is deteriorated. Studies have shown that the imaging quality of high sophisticated IOL designs is more sensitive to lens displacements than simpler designs. The effects of IOL displacements are not well represented and tested within the current IOL test standard ISO 11979 - 2. This fact leads to the necessity to develope new test standards for novel and more sophisticated IOL designs. In this paper we present an improved model eye, which extends the current standard in three main aspects: First, the eye-model is very close to the physiology of the human eye. Second, electromechanic drives allow an automatic and precise simulation of postoperative lens tilts and <b>decentrations,</b> and finally in addition to standard conform MTF analysis, in the proposed setup also wavefront aberrations are measured. The latter reveals specific image aberrations caused by lens displacements. The model eye allows to objectively analyze the displacement tolerance of various IOL designs. The functionality of this novel setup is tested by measuring a spherical and an aspheric IOL design. Additionally, for comparison, IOLs that were already investigated with a previous version of the presented model eye are used for analysis. Measurements results reveal improvements compared to the previous version of the model eye and a functional prototype for wavefront measurement...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} how aberration-controlling, customised soft contact lenses corrected higher-order ocular aberrations and visual performance in keratoconic patients {{compared to other}} forms of refractive correction (spectacles and rigid gas-permeable lenses). Methods: Twenty-two patients (16 rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearers and six spectacle wearers) were fitted with standard toric soft lenses and customised lenses (designed to correct 3 rd-order coma aberrations). In the rigid gas-permeable lens-wearing patients, ocular aberrations were measured without lenses, with the patient's habitual lenses and with the study lenses (Hartmann-Shack aberrometry). In the spectacle-wearing patients, ocular aberrations were measured both with and without the study lenses. LogMAR visual acuity (high-contrast and low-contrast) was evaluated with the patient wearing their habitual correction (of either spectacles or rigid gas-permeable contact lenses) and with the study lenses. Results: In the contact lens wearers, the habitual rigid gas-permeable lenses and customised lenses provided significant reductions in 3 rd-order coma root-mean-square (RMS) error, 3 rd-order RMS and higher-order RMS error (p ≤ 0. 004). In the spectacle wearers, the standard toric lenses and customised lenses significantly reduced 3 rd-order RMS and higher-order RMS errors (p ≤ 0. 005). The spectacle wearers showed no significant differences in visual performance measured between their habitual spectacles and the study lenses. However, in the contact lens wearers, the habitual rigid gas-permeable lenses and standard toric lenses provided significantly better high-contrast acuities compared to the customised lenses (p ≤ 0. 006). Conclusions: The customised lenses provided substantial reductions in ocular aberrations in these keratoconic patients; however, the poor visual performances achieved with these lenses {{are most likely to be}} due to small, on-eye lens <b>decentrations...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{determining}} the complete set of patient-specific ocular parameters, including surface curvatures, asphericities, refractive indices, tilts, <b>decentrations,</b> thicknesses, and index gradients. The data consist of the raw detector outputs {{of one or more}} Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (WFSs); unlike conventional wavefront sensing, we do not perform centroid estimation, wavefront reconstruction, or wavefront correction. Parameters in the eye model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood. Since a purely Gaussian noise model is used to emulate electronic noise, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation reduces to nonlinear least-squares fitting between the data and the output of our optical design program. Bounds on the estimate variances are computed with the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for different configurations of the data-acquisition system, thus enabling system optimization. A global search algorithm called simulated annealing (SA) is used for the estimation step, due to multiple local extrema in the likelihood surface. The ML approach to parameter estimation is very time-consuming, so rapid processing techniques are implemented with the graphics processing unit (GPU). We are leveraging our general method of reverse-engineering optical systems in optical shop testing for various applications. For surface profilometry of aspheres, which involves the estimation of high-order aspheric coefficients, we generated a rapid ray-tracing algorithm that is well-suited to the GPU architecture. Additionally, reconstruction of the index distribution of GRIN lenses is performed using analytic solutions to the eikonal equation. Another application is parameterized wavefront estimation, in which the pupil phase distribution of an optical system is estimated from multiple irradiance patterns near focus. The speed and accuracy of the forward computations are emphasized, and our approach has been refined to handle large wavefront aberrations and nuisance parameters in the imaging system...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{models of}} the human eye {{have been used in}} visual science for {{purposes}} such as providing a framework for explaining optical phenomena in vision, for predicting how refraction and aberrations are affected by change in ocular biometry, and as having computational tools for exploring the limitations imposed on vision by the optical system of the eye. We address the issue of what is understood by optical model eyes, discussing the “encyclopedia” and “toy train” approaches to modelling. An extensive list of purposes of models is provided. We discuss many of the theoretical types of optical models (also schematic eyes) of varying anatomical accuracy, including single, three and four refracting surface variants. We cover the models with lens structure in the form of nested shells and gradient index. Many optical eye models give accurate predictions only for small angles and small fields of view; if aberrations and image quality are important to consider, such paraxial model eyes must be replaced by finite model eyes incorporating features such as aspheric surfaces, tilts and <b>decentrations,</b> wavelength-dependent media and curved retinas. Many optical model eyes are population averages, and must become adaptable to account for age, gender, ethnicity, refractive error and accommodation. They can also be customised for the individual when extensive ocular biometry and optical performance data are available. We consider which optical model should be used for a particular purpose, adhering to the principle that the best model is the simplest fit for the task.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the optical performance of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) after <b>decentration</b> and with different pupil diameters, {{but with the}} IOL astigmatic axis aligned. METHODS: Optical performances of toric T 5 and SN 60 AT spherical IOLs after <b>decentration</b> were tested on a theoretical pseudophakic model eye based on the Hwey-Lan Liou schematic eye using the Zemax ray-tracing program. Changes in optical performance were analyzed in model eyes with 3 -mm, 4 -mm, and 5 -mm pupil diameters and decentered from 0. 25 mm to 0. 75 mm with an interval of 5 ° at the meridian direction from 0 ° to 90 °. The ratio of the modulation transfer function (MTF) between a decentered and a centered IOL (MTFDecentration/MTFCentration) was calculated to analyze the decrease in optical performance. RESULTS: Optical performance of the toric IOL remained unchanged when IOLs were decentered in any meridian direction. The MTFs of the two IOLs decreased, whereas optical performance remained equivalent after <b>decentration.</b> The MTFDecentration/MTFCentration ratios of the IOLs at a <b>decentration</b> from 0. 25 mm to 0. 75 mm were comparable in the toric and SN 60 AT IOLs.

In the initial study, eyelid photographs of healthy volunteers were captured using the Nikon D 5000 digital SLR camera. Eyelid parameters were determined from the photographs using i-Metrics software. The performance of BE spherical OK lenses on minimally and moderately toric corneas was evaluated in retrospective and prospective studies. When evaluating the performance of toric OK lenses on moderately toric corneas on {{a small number of}} participants the DreamLite TRZ toric periphery OK lens design was used. In general, corneal asymmetry was found to be significant between horizontal sectors but not in vertical sectors in minimally toric corneas. Several corneal sectors showed a difference between East Asian and non-East Asian eyes with clinically significant differences apparent only in the superior corneal sector. Upper eyelid curvature in non-East Asian eyes showed a stronger positive association with corneal spherical equivalent power than in East Asian eyes. During spherical OK lens wear on minimally toric corneas, a tendency of TZ <b>decentration</b> {{to move away from the}} most prolate corneal region was found. In the same cohort, it was shown that TZ <b>decentration</b> caused non-uniform corneal curvature changes. Significant central temporal flattening and para-central steepening were consistent with temporal TZ <b>decentration.</b> When the TZ <b>decentration</b> during spherical OK was compared between minimally and moderately toric corneas, <b>decentration</b> was significantly greater in moderately toric corneas. Alternative methods of fitting OK lenses with slightly deeper sag heights did not show any benefit in controlling TZ <b>decentration</b> in moderately toric corneas. Toric OK lens fitting on moderately toric corneas showed greater TZ <b>decentration</b> compared to spherical OK lenses, but the TZ margins were well defined giving good visual outcomes. In conclusion, normal corneal shape asymmetry in minimally toric corneas and magnitude of corneal toricity were shown to influence TZ <b>decentration.</b> Toric OK lenses may provide improved visual outcomes in moderately toric corneas...|$|E

ResultsIn total, 139 right and 129 left eyes were included. IOL displacement averaged 150  μm upward and 150  μm to the nasal side of the pupil. Over 50 % of the eyes were tilted upward and approximately 90 % to the temporal side. The surgical approach was significantly associated with horizontal <b>decentration</b> in both eyes, but significantly associated with only vertical <b>decentration</b> in the right eye 1  week postoperatively.

The errors are up to twice those occurring for the spherical lenses, and can be quite high, e. g. 0. 9 D astigmatism for + 6 D power with 10 degrees tilt in 20 degrees upgaze.

Materials and methods: All presbyopic (age > 40  years, near add ≥+ 1. 25  D) and non-presbyopic (age ≥ 18 years, no near add requirements, spherical equivalent ≤- 0. 50  D) participants were each fitted bilaterally with six and two MFCLs (test lens), respectively, and with one single vision lens (control lens). Lens <b>decentration,</b> ie, the x- and y-differences between the contact lens and pupil centers, was objectively determined. Third-order aberrations were measured and compared. Visual performance (high- and low-contrast acuities and several subjective variables) was analyzed for any associations (Pearson’s correlation, r) with MFCL <b>decentration.</b> Results: A total of 17 presbyopic (55. 1 ± 6. 9  years) and eight non-presbyopic (31. 0 ± 3. 3  years) participants completed the study.

In both groups, lens-induced vertical coma (C(3, - 1)) was, by at least tenfold, significantly more positive for the Proclear® MFCL Distance lens and significantly more negative for the Proclear® MFCL Near lens. In the presbyopic group, the correlation of total MFCL <b>decentration</b> with vision variables was weak (r<| 0. 191 |).

Group A was implanted with Akreos AO(Bausch & Lomb; four-haptic) while group B implanted with ZCB 00 (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc. AMO; two-haptic). All eyes underwent standard phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. Diameter of capsulotomy was recorded. One month postoperatively, vision, best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) assessment, slit lamp examination, and anterior chamber depth(ACD) measured by UBM were performed. Tilt and <b>decentration</b> were measured horizontally and vertically, and total tilt and <b>decentration</b> were calculated by geometry method. RESULTS:No statistical difference was found in BCVA and diameter of capsulotomy between two groups(P > 0. 05). The mean ACD of group A and group B were 3. 86 mm± 0. 31 mm and 4. 14 mm± 0. 31 mm respectively, which showed it had statistically significant difference(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:Two-haptic IOL shows no difference in tilt and <b>decentration</b> with four-haptic IOL postoperatively...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the tilt and <b>decentration</b> of the crystalline lens and the intraocular lens (IOL) {{relative to the}} corneal topographic axis using anterior segment ocular coherence tomography (AS-OCT). A sample set of 100 eyes from 49 subjects (41 eyes with crystalline lenses and 59 eyes with IOLs) were imaged using second generation AS-OCT (CASIA 2, TOMEY) in June and July 2016 at Okayama University. Both mydriatic and non-mydriatic images were obtained, and the tilt and <b>decentration</b> of the crystalline lens and the IOL were quantified. The effects of pupil dilation on measurements were also assessed. The crystalline lens showed an average tilt of 5. 15 ° towards the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis under non-mydriatic conditions and 5. 25 ° under mydriatic conditions. Additionally, an average <b>decentration</b> of 0. 11 mm towards the temporal direction was observed under non-mydriatic conditions and 0. 08 mm under mydriatic conditions. The average tilt for the IOL was 4. 31 ° towards the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis under non-mydriatic conditions and 4. 65 ° {{in the same direction}} under mydriatic conditions. The average <b>decentration</b> was 0. 05 mm towards the temporal direction under non-mydriatic conditions and 0. 08 mm in the same direction under mydriatic conditions. A strong correlation was found between the average tilt and <b>decentration</b> values of the crystalline lens and the IOL under both non-mydriatic and mydriatic conditions (all Spearman correlation coefficients, r ≥ 0. 800; all P < 0. 001). When measured using second generation AS-OCT, both the crystalline lens and the IOL showed an average tilt of 4 - 6 ° toward the inferotemporal direction relative to the corneal topographic axis and an average <b>decentration</b> of less than 0. 12 mm towards the temporal direction. These results were not influenced by pupil dilation and they showed good repeatability...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the {{changes of the}} corneal surface morphology undergoing overnight orthokeratology treatment and assess the effect of optical center deviation in controlling the development of myopia. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical study. One hundred and thirty-four children(134 eyes) with myopia aged 10. 66 ± 1. 79 years were treated with overnight orthokeratology lenses. The examinations of visual acuity, axial length and corneal topography were performed before and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 mo after wearing orthokeratology. The results of right eye were taken {{as the object of}} this study, SPSS 19. 0 for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The distance of <b>decentration</b> about 134 children at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 mo after wearing orthokeratology were 0. 84 ± 0. 45 mm, 0. 77 ± 0. 40 mm, 0. 79 ± 0. 41 mm, 0. 78 ± 0. 41 mm, and 0. 79 ± 0. 42 mm respectively. The difference between these groups were not statistically significant(F = 1. 187, P = 0. 319). The mean distance of <b>decentration</b> after orthokeratology treatment was 0. 79 ± 0. 35 mm, the growth of axial length after 24 mo was 0. 32 ± 0. 30 mm, the mean distance of <b>decentration</b> divided into 3 groups, mild(1. 0 mm) 28 eyes, the growth of axial length frow 3 groups after 24 mo were 0. 45 ± 0. 34 mm, 0. 32 ± 0. 28 mm, 0. 23 ± 0. 29 mm, were statistically significant difference between each groups(F = 3. 825, P = 0. 024). By linear-regression analysis, the growth of axial length and the mean distance of <b>decentration</b> after 24 mo was statistically significant difference(F = 7. 246, P = 0. 008), equation of linear regression was Y = 0. 478 - 0. 194 X. At 24 mo after wearing orthokeratology, the mean distance of <b>decentration</b> about 18 eyes with monocular diplopia was 1. 18 ± 0. 36 mm, and 116 eyes without monocular was 0. 73 ± 0. 31 mm, the distance of <b>decentration</b> were statistically significant difference(t = 5. 59, P CONCLUSION: The degree of <b>decentration</b> tended to be stable after 3 mo of orthokeratology treatment and influenced the effect of myopia control and visual quality...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose — The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the lateral forces during the fall of a magnet in a conducting pipe, when the direction of magnetization of the magnet is fixed. If the direction of magnetization is not parallel to the axis of the pipe, lateral forces occur and a <b>decentration</b> of the magnet happens. Design/methodology/approach — The problem is studied numerically, with a T − h 3 D FE formulation well-suited for the problem. Computational results are compared with experimental results. Findings — The physical model is given and the main force coefficients analyzed. The lateral forces and the <b>decentration</b> phenomenon are studied as a function of the main parameters (thickness and radius of the pipe). Originality/value — The direction of magnetization is a key parameter to analyze the dynamics of a magnet motion inside a conducting pipe, when the radii of the pipe and the magnet are not so close. This analysis with a fixed direction of magnetization allows to quantify the lateral forces and the <b>decentration,</b> and is a first step to understand the complete motion which includes the rotation which can be linked to the <b>decentration...</b>|$|E
