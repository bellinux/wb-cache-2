There was significant increase (p <  0.01) in DM when N was applied irrespective of {{the application}} of P fertilizer. Statistically, significant (p <  0.01) interactive effects of N and P mineral fertilizer on DM accumulation were observed. The application of inorganic N fertilizer significantly (p <  0.01) increased aboveground DM by 18.3, 29.3 and 33.6  % at N concentrations of 40, 80 and 120  kg ha− 1 respectively over the control.

40|$|Dry matter (DM) {{production}} and crude protein (CP%) of sheep urine patches in a grazed cocksfoot pasture (28 day rotation with 21 ± 1 days regrowth) were measured at Lincoln University from September 1999 to May 2001. Also, the <b>DM</b> <b>response</b> from artificial urine patches was measured over time. The rate of nitrogen (N) applied per hectare {{in an individual}} urine patch was 173 kg N/ha in autumn compared with 448 kg N/ha in spring. This stimulated a maximum difference in DM production between urine patches and controls over a 21 day period of 1970 kg DM/ha in spring (October). Smaller differences were measured in summer (380 kg DM/ha) and winter (370 kg DM/ha). The maximum difference in CP% was also in spring being 27. 0 % for urine patches and 18. 7 % for controls. DM production differences were attributed to differences in net leaf photosynthetic rate, which ranged from 23. 5 in spring to 4. 5 mol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ in summer. Leaf photosynthetic rate was limited solely by N supply in spring, by soil moisture (mean soil volumetric water content in the top 500 mm < 20 %) and leaf N content (< 3 %N) in summer and mainly by low temperatures (< 9 ºC) but also N supply in winter. The low temperature in winter also meant the duration of urine patch response was 133 days compared with 105 days in spring and 77 days in summer. In a second experiment, the <b>DM</b> <b>response</b> of cocksfoot to synthetic urine (300 kg N/ha) and irrigation was examined in ungrazed areas (four 60 -day regrowth periods and one 110 -day winter regrowth). From these treatments, the maximum annual DM production for cocksfoot with irrigation and N was 28. 6 t DM/ha/yr compared with 9. 2 t DM/ha/yr for the control. The addition of irrigation alone yielded 13. 0 t DM/ha/yr compared with N alone at 23. 5 t DM/ha/yr. To overcome the N stress in cocksfoot pastures a combination of applied N in spring, tap rooted perennial legumes in summer and annual clovers in winter is recommended...|$|E

In 2007 experiments were undertaken to validate the accuracy of DGT in assessing P availability and crop response to applications of P fertiliser in the field. Samples were taken from more than 20 P response trials throughout southern Australia. Each soil test measurement was correlated with the response of the crop (% relative yield) to the application of P by taking dry matter cuts at mid-late tillering.

A new ferrofluid deformable mirror technology for high-contrast imaging is currently under development at Princeton, featuring a flexible optical surface manipulated {{by the local}} electromagnetic and global hydraulic actuation of a reservoir of ferrofluid. The ferrofluid DM is designed to prioritize high optical surface quality, high-precision/low-stroke actuation, and excellent low-spatial-frequency performance|capabilities that meet the unique demands of high-contrast coronagraphy in a space-based platform. To this end, the ferrofluid medium continuously supports the DM facesheet, a configuration that eliminates actuator print-through (or, quilting) by decoupling the nominal surface figure from the geometry of the actuator array. The global pressure control allows independent focus actuation. In this paper we describe an analytical model for the quasi-static deformation response of the DM facesheet to both magnetic and pressure actuation.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} an alternative selection process that involves multiple and conflicting objectives. A facilitator asks a decision-maker (DM), or a decision-making body, questions and obtains responses {{in order to}} help the DM select a most preferred alternative. The <b>DM</b> <b>responses</b> to these questions do not necessarily result in precisely determined parameter values (e. g., weights and value scores corresponding to a given model of preference). The goal of this research is to guide the facilitator in selecting what question to ask next, and determining when to terminate the question-response process. We model the facilitator’s question selection problem as a Markov decision process, and present conditions that guarantee the existence of a question-response policy to identify a most preferred alternative in a finite number of questions. We also present conditions that guarantee the existence of a questionresponse policy that will identify a most preferred alternative as the number of questions asked goes to infinity. Both of these sets of conditions are easily identified a priori and may be used to aid a facilitator in determining which questions to ask, and when to terminate the alternative selection process because identification of a most preferred alternative is not possible.

40|$|At present, {{and more}} so in the future, {{irrigated}} agriculture will take place under water scarcity. Owing to the global expansion of irrigated areas and the limited availability of irrigation water, {{there is a need}} to optimize water production and use efficiency (WUE). In South Africa, annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is one of the most widely grown cool season pasture species under irrigation. It is mainly used in dairy farming enterprises. Shortages of water and nitrogen can, however, be limiting factors for the production of this pasture. By using appropriate irrigation and nitrogen management tools, water and nitrogen productivity of the pasture can be improved. The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine the effects of different water levels in combination with different N fertiliser applications on the growth rate and dry matter production, quality, water use and water use efficiency of annual ryegrass. For two seasons, the trial was conducted under a rain shelter on the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. Higher frequency of irrigation coupled with high nitrogen application significantly improved the dry matter yield. Canopy size influenced the LAI and FI which in turn affects the yield. The study showed that the treatments that were irrigated twice weekly and top-dressed with 60 kg N ha- 1 after each cut consumed the most water, and this resulted in the production of higher yield, maintenance of the largest leaf area index and higher interception of the incoming solar radiation. The increase in these parameters may be due to the sufficient water and nitrogen fertiliser that induces rapid cell elongation as a result of higher water potential, higher turgor pressure and higher photosynthetic processes. As hypothesized, the decrease in the frequency of water application resulted in an increase in the DMC, digestibility, ME and CP values. Nitrogen application had an effect on the WU, as less water was used in the treatments that received no nitrogen. Highest KC value recorded was in the optimal range and this indicates that the treatments were not over-irrigated. As the irrigation interval increased, more water was depleted from the soil profile. Depletion rates increased as the season progressed but generally it was minimal in the frequently irrigated treatments. Increase in WUE was achieved by reducing the frequency of irrigation from twice a week to once a week without causing significant yield loss. A possible reason for the increase in the WUE by reducing the irrigation frequency could be ascribed in part to reduced evaporation from the soil resulting from the lower wetting frequency of the deficit irrigation treatments. Within the same irrigation frequency, higher WUE was achieved by alleviating a limiting factor, N fertiliser, in this case, through increases in dry matter production. The highest WUE was achieved by irrigating once every two weeks. However, in some treatments, the WUE was not improved with the reduction in the frequency of irrigation as the water saved was overshadowed by yield loss. In summary, it can be said that the hypotheses that pasture production will be positively associated with soil moisture content, water stress can improve the quality of the pasture, N fertiliser will increase the <b>DM</b> <b>response</b> to soil moisture content and WUE will increase by alleviating a limiting factor, N fertiliser in this case were accepted. A logical extension of this work would be to do the trial in an open field to analyze the effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on the growth, yield and quality of the pasture and then extrapolate the results to other sites and soil types using models.

40|$|Increasing legume {{abundance}} is {{an important}} component of pastoral intensification, in providing increased quality feed and nitrogen inputs to nitrogen deficient, hill and high country grassland. Establishment and persistence of traditionally sown clover species white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) is often limited in summer dry areas. The ecology of naturalised adventive (volunteer) annual clovers species Trifolium arvense L., Trifolium dubium Sibth, Trifolium glomeratum L., and Trifolium striatum L. commonly found in the South Island hill and high country areas of New Zealand was examined through a series of site surveys, field trials, and glasshouse experiments. The relationship of these clover species to environmental factors of climate (annual rainfall), topography (slope, altitude, aspect), soil fertility (phosphorus, sulphur, pH), and sheep grazing (spring management, and preference) were investigated. On two contrasting hill and high country stations in the South Island: Glenfalloch in inland Canterbury (1665 mm annual rainfall) and Mt Grand in Central Otago (703 mm annual rainfall), the abundance of these species was quantified in relation to environmental factors. Site surveys were conducted in three hill blocks per farm, with measurements of grassland species cover, slope, aspect, grazing intensity, soil fertility, soil depth, and altitude, made within quadrats along three transects at upper, middle and lower hill slope positions. The single adventive clover present at Glenfalloch was Trifolium dubium, whereas all adventive species were present at Mt Grand. The % cover of adventive annual clovers was greater (30. 1) than that of white clover Trifolium repens (3. 8) or subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum (0. 1) at Mt Grand. Trifolium repens % cover decreased with increasing altitude. Striated clover Trifolium striatum and cluster clover Trifolium glomeratum % cover was greatest on sunny aspects, while Trifolium repens % cover was greatest on shady aspects. Trifolium repens cover increased and Trifolium striatum cover decreased with increasing available soil phosphorus (P). Annual rainfall appeared to be the main environmental factor influencing the abundance of adventive annual clover species on two geographically and climatically different South Island high country stations. A two year spring grazing management and superphosphate (SP) application field trial was conducted at a typical summer dry pasture site on a mid altitude (~ 700 m a. s. l.) north-facing moderately steep, hill site at Mt Grand Station. Adventive annual clover biomass, botanical composition and population dynamics were measured from October 2008 –May 2010, from low (75 kg/ha) and high (200 kg/ha) SP application split plots of 2. 5 x 5 m area within different grazing management main plots (continuous and mid-spring closure) of 5 x 5 m area. Adventive annual clover species contributed the largest proportion of legume sward content at this site, with sown species contributing the least. Collectively, adventive annual clover species accounted for over 90 % of the sward clover content present during both years. Trifolium striatum was the dominant adventive species. Large variation in biomass production (668 and 51 kg DM/ha), sward botanical contribution (28 and 2 %) and seedling recruitment (9. 7 and 24 seedlings/core) by adventive annual clovers was observed between the two years of sampling, which was attributed to high rainfall during spring and early summer of the first year compared to the very dry spring of the second year. Deferred spring grazing resulted in significantly more adventive annual clover biomass in a moist year (1452 kg DM/ha) in comparison to continuous grazing (674 – 805 kg DM/ha). However, this did not appear to result in significantly more adventive annual clover seed production, seedling recruitment, or biomass in the following year. Superphosphate (SP) application had no significant overall influence on adventive annual clover species biomass. High SP application did {{have a negative effect on}} autumn seedling recruitment of the three most prevalent adventive annual clover species (Trifolium striatum, T. dubium, and T. glomeratum). Soil plant-available N sourced from pasture legumes has been shown to be positively associated with long-term use of fertiliser phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S) use in NZ high and hill country. Determining the nutrient requirements of little known naturalised, adventive pasture legume species such as cluster clover (Trifolium glomeratum), haresfoot clover (T. arvense), striated clover (T. striatum) and suckling clover (T. dubium) that exist on low fertility, summer dry hill and high country slopes is important for the productive pastoral sustainability of extensive livestock grazing agroecosystems. The first glasshouse study was conducted to determine the yield response of these four adventive annual species, plus Trifolium subterraneum and T. repens, to increasing levels of available P in a typical, low fertility, acidic NZ high country soil. The order of greatest yield <b>DM</b> <b>response</b> was T. subterraneum > T. arvense > T. repens > T. dubium > T. glomeratum > T. striatum (4. 4 – 0. 8 g DM/pot), while the P application rates at which maximum yield was produced varied between the species with T. arvense and T. striatum yielding the most DM at 250 mg P/kg soil, T. subterraneum, T. glomeratum and T. repens yielded the greatest amount at 500 mg P/kg soil, and T. dubium producing its highest yield at 2500 mg P/kg soil. The order of greatest P-response efficiency by species (how much P was required for each gram of DM produced) was T. subterraneum > T. arvense > T. repens > T. glomeratum > T. dubium > T. striatum. Implications for low input, extensive grazing systems in hill and high country areas are discussed. The growth response and nutrient uptake of four adventive annual clovers to applied S or lime (CaCO 3), grown in a typical low fertility South Island (S. I.) high country soil, were investigated under glasshouse conditions and compared to white and subterranean clovers as reference species. The annual species had yield responses of 12 – 17 %, or were unresponsive, to S applications. Maximum yields were generally in the order of T. subterraneum ≥ T. arvense > T. striatum ≥ T. dubium > T. glomeratum > T. repens (8. 0 – 5. 2 g DM/pot). For lime treatments, yields were strongly driven by P availability, linked to soil pH. Trifolium repens and T. striatum responded to liming at low lime rates (1 t/ha equivalent), while all other species had negative yield responses to liming. The data indicate that the adventive annual clovers are better adapted to low soil fertility (low pH and S) conditions, which in turn may be an important factor contributing to their success under S. I. high country field conditions. Grazing preference of Merino sheep for the adventive annual clover species was investigated in a field trial at a dryland pasture site on the Canterbury Plains at Lincoln University. The quantity of clover species sward biomass removed during grazing and the time spent grazing from different clover species swards was quantified during grazing preferences tests in November and December. Relative preference (Chesson-Manly index) for each clover species sward on offer was calculated from the utilisation of each species relative to the utilisation of all other species on offer. Relative preference decreased and was significantly different between species when they reached a reproductive stage of maturity. This was attributed to an overall decrease in nutritive value of clover herbage, with relative preference significantly correlated with the concentration of acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), protein, and dry matter digestibility (DMD) chemical components. The latest flowering clover species were the most preferred, with Trifolium repens the most preferred clover species overall. Trifolium arvense was the most preferred adventive clover species when most species were predominately vegetative. Implications of key results and further research avenues are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Safflower {{represents}} an important oil crop internationally {{and may have}} a certain production potential under German conditions, particularly in organic farming where the putatively low nutrient requirement is highly welcomed. Current knowledge regarding the nutrient require-ments of safflower as compared to similar oil crops is limited. However safflower was held worthy under German conditions {{in the beginning of}} this century, it was thus the aim of this study to determine the response of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) as compared to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in terms of growth, yield, and nutrient use efficiencies with respect to NPK supply in pot experiments using soil mixture. A further nutrient solution experiment with respect to P was conducted. A field experiment was done to screen ten safflower cultivars ((1) Sabina, (2) PI- 572475 /Saffire, (3) PI- 209286, (4) PI- 253518, (5) PI- 253555, (6) BS- 62915, (7) BS- 62924, (8) CART- 19 / 89, (9) DO- 13 / 03 and (10) DO- 15 / 03) for yield under low input organic farming under northern German conditions. Both species responded strongly to increasing N supply with respect to plant growth and yield. Growth and yield of safflower increased up to 1 g N per pot for safflower, while the optimum for sunflower was 2. 0 g N per pot. Safflower out-yielded sunflower at low N sup-ply, while at high N level the opposite was observed. Pearson coefficients indicate that in safflower, yield is tightly correlated with the number of capitula per plant and the mass per achene, while these two yield components are tightly correlated to each other. To the con-trary, sunflower yield was most tightly correlated with the number of achenes per capitulum, followed by the mass per achene. Path coefficient analysis considering the most important traits determining oil yield revealed that in sunflower, the number of achenes per capitulum exerts a strong direct effect on oil yield, and compensatory effects with the number of capitula per plant and the number of achenes per capitulum are not important. For safflower direct effects of the achene and leaf N content as well as the leaf dry matter are small, and mediated principally via the indirect effect on the number of achenes per capitulum. Both species accumulated similar amounts of N per pot at equivalent N supplies, but safflower was better N accumulator (concentrator) than sunflower due to safflower’s less dry matter. Safflower utilizes absorbed N more efficiently than sunflower to produce achene yield at suboptimal N supply in terms of efficiency ratio and utilization index, but the opposite holds true at optimal and high supply. The efficiency to use accumulated N for dry matter and achene production interpreted in terms of Michaelis-Menten kinetics reveals the low Cmin and Km value in safflower compared to sunflower. It can be concluded that in terms of N availability safflower represents a low input crop and outperforms sunflower with respect to achene yield on soils low in available N. Both species responded strongly to increasing P levels in terms of plant growth and yield. Growth and yield of safflower increased up to 1 g P per pot, while the optimum for sunflower was 0. 5 g P per pot only. Supply of P affected safflower yield mainly through increasing number of capitula per plant and number of achenes per capitulum was reduced at very low P supply. Sunflower yield was improved with increasing P supply through increased number of achenes per capitulum only. Yield component analysis reveals that, oil yield in safflower was affected by P deficiency mainly due to number of capitulum per plant followed by the number of achenes per capitulum followed by single achene mass (SAM), but contribution of oil content to overall yield variation was insignificant. Sunflower major yield component influencing oil yield was number of achenes per plant, followed by SAM without a significant contribution of the oil content. Pearson correlations, followed by path coefficient analysis indicate that in sunflower only total N accumulated was found to be most important, while in safflower the total amount of P and N accumulated showed the highest standardized partial regression coefficient. Sunflower accumulated much more P (mg/pot) than safflower at all equivalent P supplies especially at low levels, but both accumulated the same P amounts at their individual optimal supplies. Uptake efficiency (mg P accumulated (mg P provided) - 1) was higher in sunflower than safflower at all equivalent P supplies including their optimal levels. Agronomic efficiency interpreted as g P required producing fixed amount of achenes (in soil experiment), or DM (in nutrient solution experiment) was higher in safflower than sunflower at optimal and suboptimal P supply indicating the superiority of sunflower in term of the efficiency to use external P supply to produce achenes and DM than safflower. Sunflower was much more efficient at their optimal and suboptimal P supplies to utilize absorbed P than safflower in term of efficiency ratio (g achene (g P accumulated) - 1) and utilization index (g achene / (g P (g DM) - 1). From the nutrient solution experiment, the <b>DM</b> <b>response</b> curves based on accumulated P (mg P pot- 1) (efficiency ratio (ER)), and P concentration in DM (mg P (g DM) - 1) (utilization index (UI)) interpreted in terms of Michaelis-Menten kinetics reveals that Km didn’t differ for both species in terms of ER, but sunflower had les Km value in term of UI. It can be concluded that safflower has a high requirement for P with respect to growth and yield; sunflower is more efficient than safflower in term of uptake and utilization of P at optimal and sub-optimal P supplies indicating that safflower cannot be considered as a low nutrient input crop in terms of phosphorus. Both species responded strongly to increasing K supply with respect to plant growth and yield. Growth and yield of safflower increased up to 1 g K per pot, while the optimum for sunflower was 3. 0 g K per pot. Safflower out-yielded sunflower at low K supply, while at high K level the opposite was observed. The number of capitula in safflower was only slightly affected by K supply and the number of achenes per capitulum was only reduced under severe K deficiency, while single achene mass increased with increasing K supply. To the contrary, in sunflower, the number of achenes per capitulum strongly responded to the K supply, as did the single achene mass. Oil yield in safflower was affected by K deficiency mainly due to reduced achene yield, not oil concentration. To the contrary, oil yield in sunflower was severely affected by low K supply due to both reduced achene yield and lower oil concentration. Multiple regression analysis indicate that in sunflower, the stem DM and the total amount of K accumulated in DM was most important, while in safflower the total amount of K and N accumulated had the highest impact. Both species accumulated similar amounts of total K in whole shoots per pot at low, equal K supply, except at extremely low K levels where safflower out-yielded sunflower. K concentration in safflower tissues was significantly lower than in sunflower at optimal and suboptimal K levels. Safflower utilizes absorbed K more efficiently than sunflower to produce achene yield at suboptimal and optimal K supply in terms of efficiency ratio, but only at suboptimal K availability when considering the utilization index. In terms of Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics addressing nutrient response curve to use K for growth and yield, Km was higher in sunflower than in safflower, while the K accumulation required initiating yield formation (Cmin) in safflower was significantly lower. Similarly, safflower required much less external K to produce a given amount of achenes than sunflower at low and optimal K supplies. It can be concluded that in terms of K availability safflower represents a low input crop and outperforms sunflower on soils low in available K. In the field experiments, the highest oil yielding cultivars were cultivar 3, and cultivar 8, while the least yielding cultivars were cultivars 2, 9, and 10. Yield component analysis reveals that the achene capitulum- 1 had the major influence on the variation of the oil yield of the ten cultivars under study (pooled) followed by capitula plant- 1 followed by TAM, while the oil concentration had slightly negative influence, and the plant density influencing oil yield negatively. Oil yield ha- 1 was strongly reduced even for the best yielding cultivars due to low achene yield and low oil concentration. As these two yield components are largely influenced by the environmental conditions at maturity, the required temperature and the sunshine duration needed for safflower to perform optimally for achene filling and oil formation was not reached. In addition to high humidity and continuous rainfall at period of maturity affected achene quality and increased disease incidence causing reduction in oil yield. Although two years are not enough to analyse the performance of safflower adaptabil-ity to certain region, cultivar 3, and 8 may have a production potential in Northern Germany, but further trials using the ten cultivars are needed. The most striking contribution from yield components to the variation of yield came from the number of achene per capitulum which must be given attention to tune safflower cultivation to provide the period of formation of this yield component more suitable climatic conditions in further research at the area of study. Saflor zählt international zu den wichtigen Ölfrüchten. In Deutschland könnte Saflor, bedingt durch den vermuteten niedrigen Nährstoffbedarf, im biologischen Landbau eine gewisse Bedeutung erlangen.

Zehn Saflorsorten (1) Sabina, (2) PI- 572475 /Saffire, (3) PI- 209286, (4) PI- 253518, (5) PI 253555, (6) BS- 62924, (8) CART- 19 / 89, (9) DO- 13 / 03 und (10) DO- 15 / 03 wurden nach den regeln des biologischen Landbaus angebaut. Beide Pflanzenarten reagierten stark auf ein erhöhtes N-Angebot. Wachstum und Ertrag von Saflors waren bei N-Gaben von 0, 1 g pro Gefäß am höchsten, bei Sonnenblume war dies bei 2, 0 g N der Fall. Bei Saflor zeichnet sich ein besserer Ertrag bei niedrigen N-Gaben im Vergleich zu Sonnenblume ab. Das Entgegengesetzte wurde bei hohem N-Niveau beobachtet. Bei der Ertragskomponentenanalyse (YCA) zeigte sich der größte Einfluss durch die N-Versorgung auf die Anzahl der Körbe (Blütenköpfe) pro Pflanze, gefolgt vom Tausendkorngewicht (TKG). Dagegen wurde beim Sonnenblumenertrag der größte Einfluss auf die Samenanzahl pro Korb gefolgt vom Tausendkorngewicht festgestellt. Beide Arten bekamen eine gleiche N-Versorgung, hatten die gleiche N-Akkumulation an N Verstehe ich nicht. Die geringere Trockensubstanzproduktion von Saflor gestattete eine besserer N-Akkumulator(im Sinne höherer N-Konzentrationen) als Sonnenblume. Bei beiden Pflanzenarten hatten die gleiche Aufnahmeeffizienz (mg N aufgenommen (mg N Angebot) - 1) bei niedrigem und hohem N-Angebot. Die N-Ausnutzungseffiziens (efficiency ratio, utilization index) hinsichtlich des Samenertrages ist bei niedrigem N-Angebot bei Saflor höher als bei Sonnenblumen. Bei optimalen und hohem N-Angebot wurden entgegengesetzten Effekte beobachtet. Saflor benötigt weniger ‘external N’ bei der niedrigen N-Stufe für die Produktion einer bestimmten Samenmenge als Sonnenblume, während bei dem jeweiligen optimalen N-Angebot das‘external N requirement’ gleich war. Für die Interpretation der Nutzungseffizienz wurden die Michaelis-Menten Gleichung für die Nährstoffaufnahme, sowie für den Samen- und Trockenmasseertrag benutzt. Im bezug auf die N-Ausnutzung bestätigt die MM-Kinetik die höhere Effizienz des Saflors bei niedrigem Km in bezug auf die TM und des Samenertrags. Der cmin-Wert hinsichtlich des Samen- und Ölertrages war bei Saflor geringer. Abschließend kann in bezug auf die N-Versorgung gesagt werden, dass Saflor hinsichtlich des Samen- und Ölertrages mit einem geringen N-Angebot auskommt als Sonnenblume. Beide Sorten reagierten stark auf die Steigerung der P Gaben. Wachstum und Ertrag des Saflors waren bei einer P-Gabe von 1, 0 g maximal, bei Sonnenblume war dies bei 0, 5 g P der Fall. Die Sonnenblumen weisen bei niedrigen und hohem P-Angebot einen höheren Ertrag auf. Der Ölertrag bei Saflor reagierte auf P-Mangel durch die Anzahl der Körbe pro Pflanze, gefolgt von der Samenanzahl pro Korb, sowie der Samenmasse. Der Einfluss unterschiedlicher Ölkonzentrationen war hinsichtlich der Ertragsveränderung bedeutungslos. Der Einfluss der P-Versorgung auf den Ölertrag von Sonnenblume manifestierte sich insbesondere durch den Einfluss auf die Anzahl der Samen pro Pflanze, gefolgt vom Tausendkorngewicht, während die Ölkonzentration wiederum ohne Einfluss war. Die P-Akkumulation (mg P Topf- 1) war bei gleicher P-Versorgung bei Sonnenblume höher als bei Saflor, insbesondere bei niedrigem P-Angebot. In der jeweiligen optimalen Versorgungsstufe akkumulierten die Kulturen die gleichen P-Menge. Sonnenblume hatte eine höhere Aufnahmeeffizienz (mg P aufgenommen (mg P Angebot) - 1) im vergleich zu Saflor. Dies fand sich bei allen P-Versorgungsstufen. Im Nährlösungsversuch wies Sonnenblume, bei gleichem P-Angebot, eine höhere P-Akkumulation (mg P Topf- 1) sowie Ausnutzung (mg P aufgenommen (mg P Angebot) - 1) auf. Sonnenblume zeigte bei optimaler P-Versorgung eine höhere Effizienz (efficiency ratio, utilization index). Bei sehr niedrigem P-Angebot zeigt Saflor ein höheres ‘efficiency ratio’ als Sonnenblume, was man als Verdünnungseffekt ansehen kann, wenn wir es als ‘utilization index’ interpretieren. Die P-Verwertung von Sonnenblume, bewertet als efficiency ratio und utilization index, ist bei moderatem Angebot höher als bei Saflor Letzteres benötigt ein höheres externes P-Angebot als Sonnenblume bei optimaler und niedriger Versorgung um einen bestimmten Samenertrag zu erzeugen. Im Nährlösungsversuch wies Saflor ein höheres ‘external P requirement’ auf als Sonnenblume um eine bestimmte Trockenmasse zu produzieren. Im Nährlösungsversuch wies die Trockensubstanzkurve von Sonnenblume einen geringeren Km auf als bei Saflor. Abschließend kann in bezug auf die P-Versorgung gesagt werden, dass Saflor einen höheren Bedarf als Sonnenblume hat, wobei letztere eine höhere Effizienz besitzt. Beide Sorten reagierten stark auf die Steigerung der K-Gaben. Wachstum und Ertrag des Saflors waren bei Gaben von 1, 0 g K pro Gefäß maximal, bei Sonnenblume war dies bei 3, 0 g K der Fall. Bei Saflor zeichnet sich ein besserer Ertrag bei niedrigen K-Gaben im Vergleich zu Sonnenblume ab. Das Entgegengesetzte wurde bei hohem K-Niveau beobachtet. In bezug auf die K-Mangelversorgung war der Ölertrag bei Saflor niedriger, wegen des verringerten Samenertrags. Auf die Ölkonzentration hatte dies keinen Einfluss. Bei der Ertragskomponentenanalyse zeigt sich, dass der Samenertrag durch das Gewicht pro Same beeinflusst wird, gefolgt von der Anzahl Körben pro Pflanze. Die Zahl der Samen pro Korb hatte einen geringfügig negativen Einfluss auf den Samenertrag. Im Gegensatz dazu reagierte der Ölertrag von Sonnenblume besonders stark auf eine niedrige K-Versorgung, welches mit dem verringerten Samenertrag und der niedrigen Ölkonzentration korrespondiert. Die Ertragskomponentenanalyse zeigt, das der Samenertrag durch die Anzahl der Samen pro Korb beeinflusst wird, gefolgt vom Tausendkorngewicht. Beide Arten akkumulierten bei niedrigem K-Angebot ähnliche Mengen. Unterschiede gab es nur bei extrem niedrigem Kalium, da zeigte Saflor eine höhere K-Akkumulation. Saflor hat bei allen K-Versorgungsstufen eine höher Ausnutzung an K (interpretiert als ‘efficiency ratio’) hinsichtlich des Samenertrages als Sonnenblume. In bezug auf den ‘utilization index’ war Saflor nur bei der niedrigen Versorgung überlegen. Saflor benötigt bei allen K-Versorgungsstufen deutlich weniger ‘external K’ um einen bestimmten Samenertrag zu erzeugen. Der aus der Ertragskurve abgeleitete Km war bei Sonnenblume höher als bei Saflor, wogegen für den cmin gegenteilige Beobachtungen gelten. Dies zeigt, dass Saflor eine höhere K-Effizienz hinsichtlich des Ölertrag besitzt. Im Feldversuch hatte die Sorte 3 und 8 den höchsten Ölertrag, dagegen hatten die Sorten 2, 9 und 10 den geringsten. Die Ertragskomponentenanalyse über alle Sorten (‘pooled’) zeigt, dass die Samenanzahl pro Korb den Haupteinfluss auf den Ölertrag bei allen 10 Sorten hat, gefolgt von der Korbanzahl pro Pflanze, und dem Tausendkorngewicht (TKG). Die Ölkonzentration war schwach negativ mit dem Ölertrag assoziiert, wie auch die Pflanzendichte. Selbst für die Sorten mit den höchsten Erträgen (Sorte 3 und 8), war aufgrund des geringen Samenertrages und der niedrigen Ölkonzentration der Ölertrag niedrig. Diese zwei Ertragskomponenten sind durch die Witterung während der Samenreife beeinflusst. Die Samenreife benötigt warme Temperaturen und längere Sonnenscheindauer für die optimale Samenbildung und Ölanreicherung, dies wurde in Norddeutschland nicht erreicht. Zusätzlich wurde die Samenqualität durch hohe Luftfeuchtigkeit, anhaltenden Regen und daraus folgendem Krankheitsbefall negativ beeinflusst. Die Anzahl an Samen pro Korb ist die Ertragkomponente, welche den größten Effekt auf den Ertrag hatte. Darauf sollte bei der Züchtung angepasster Genotypen die größte Beachtung gelegt werden...|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that arginase 1 contributes to coronary vasomotor dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Coronary arterioles were dissected from the right atrial appendages of 41 consecutive patients with or without DM (the 2 groups suffered from similar comorbidities), and agonist-induced changes in diameter were measured with videomicroscopy. We found that the endothelium-dependent agonist ACh elicited a diminished vasodilation and caused constriction to the highest ACh concentration (0. 1 ?M) with a similar magnitude in patients with (18 ? 8 %) and without (17 ? 9 %) <b>DM.</b> <b>Responses</b> to ACh were not significantly affected by the inhibition of NO synthesis with N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in either group.

Correspondingly, the protein expression of arginase 1 was increased in coronary arterioles of patients with DM compared with subjects without diabetes. Moreover, using immunocytochemistry, we detected an abundant immunostaining of arginase 1 in coronary endothelial cells of patients with DM, which was colocalized with NO synthase.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the two level 0 - 1 {{programming}} problems {{in which there are}} two decision makers (DMs); the decision maker at the upper level and the decision maker at the lower level. The authors modify the problematic aspects of a computation method for the Stackelberg solution which they previously presented, and thus propose an improved computation method. Specifically, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed with the objective of boosting the accuracy of solutions while maintaining the diversity of the population, which adopts a clustering method instead of calculating distances during sharing. Also, in order to eliminate unnecessary computation, an additional algorithm is included for avoiding obtaining the rational reaction of the lower level <b>DM</b> in <b>response</b> to upper level DM’s decisions when necessary. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is intended to make a comparison with existing methods by performing numerical experiments into both the accuracy of solutions and the computation time.

(calliandra) and 11 accessions of {{different}} Leucaena spp. (leucaena) were evaluated for suitability to improve livestock nutrition in highland small-holder farming systems. Dry matter (<b>DM)</b> yield, <b>response</b> to phosphorus (P) application, and feed quality were measured as indices of adaption on an acidic Nitosol at Soddo, southern Ethiopia. Flowering and seed production were observed. Herbage DM yields of all calliandra accessions {{were significantly higher}} than those of the leucaenas, except for L. diversifolia (ILCA 14193). Tree height, spread, stem diameter, and DM yields responded significantly to P application. Calliandra fodder generally has low in vitro dry matter digestibility compared to leucaenas at physiologically similar stages of growth. The clearly superior growth performance of calliandra observed will therefore have to be judged from its usefulness to livestock by in vivo studies at the farm level. While being widely used as a multipurpose tree, calliandra has not been extensively researched for its forage value. There seems to be considerable scope for selecting highly productive and useful lines of calliandra for incorporation into small-holder farming systems in the southern, western, and southwestern highlands of Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{meta-analysis}} of literature data, this study aimed {{to quantify the}} dry matter (<b>DM)</b> intake <b>response</b> to changes in diet composition, and milk responses (yield, milk component yields and milk composition) to changes in dietary net energy for lactation (NEL) and metabolizable protein (MP) in dairy cows. From all studies included in the database, 282 experiments (825 treatments) with experimentally induced changes in either NEL or MP content were kept for this analysis. These treatments covered {{a wide range of}} diet characteristics and therefore {{a large part of the}} plausible NEL and MP contents and supplies that can be expected in practical situations. The average MP and NEL contents were, respectively (mean±SD), 97 ± 12 g/kg DM and 6. 71 ± 0. 42 MJ/kg DM. On a daily supply basis, there were high between-experiment correlations for MP and NEL above maintenance. Therefore, supplies of MP and NEL above maintenance were, respectively, centred on MP supply for which MP efficiency into milk protein is 0. 67, and NEL above maintenance supply for which the ratio of NEL milk/NEL above maintenance is 1. 00 (centred variables were called MP 67 and NEL 100). The majority of the selected studies used groups of multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in mid lactation, milked twice a day. Using a mixed model, between- and within-experiment variation was split to estimate DM intake and milk responses. The use of NEL 100 and MP 67 supplies substantially improved the accuracy of the prediction of milk yield and milk component yields responses with, on average, a 27 % lower root mean square error (RMSE) relative to using dietary NEL and MP contents as predictors. For milk composition (g/kg), the average RMSE was only 3 % lower on a supply basis compared with a concentration basis. Effects of NEL and MP supplies on milk yield and milk component yields responses were additive. Increasing NEL supply increases energy partitioning towards body reserve, whereas increasing MP supply increases the partition of energy towards milk. On a nitrogen basis, the marginal efficiency decreases with increasing MP supply from 0. 34 at MP 67 =− 400 g/day to 0. 07 at MP 67 = 300 g/day. This difference in MP 67 supply, assuming reference energy level of NEL 100 = 0, equates to a global nitrogen efficiency decrease from 0. 82 to 0. 58. The equations accurately describe <b>DM</b> intake <b>response</b> to change in dietary contents and milk responses to change in dietary supply and content of NEL and MP across a wide range of dietary compositions...|$|R
40|$|While it is {{attractive}} to integrate a deformable mirror (DM) for adaptive optics (AO) into the telescope itself rather than using relay optics within an instrument, the resulting large DM can be expensive, particularly for extremely large telescopes. A low-cost approach for building a large DM is to use voice-coil actuators, and rely on feedback from mechanical sensors to improve the dynamic response of the mirror sufficiently {{so that it can}} be used in a standard AO control system. The use of inexpensive voice-coil actuators results in many lightly- damped structural resonances within the desired control bandwidth. We present a robust control approach for this problem, and demonstrate performance in a closed-loop AO simulation, incorporating realistic models of low-cost actuators and sensors. The first contribution is to demonstrate that high-bandwidth active damping can be robustly implemented even with non-collocated sensors, by relying on the "acoustic limit" of the structure where the modal bandwidth exceeds the modal spacing. Next we introduce a novel local control approach, which significantly improves the high spatial frequency performance relative to collocated position control, but without the robustness challenges associated with a global control approach. The combination of these "inner" control loops results in <b>DM</b> command <b>response</b> that is demonstrated to be sufficient for integration within an AO system...|$|R

However, analysis of trade union <b>responses</b> to <b>DM</b> in continental Europe is strikingly underdeveloped, although {{there is good reason}} to suspect that unions may play some role in shaping DM due to their institutionalised roles in issues of equality. This thesis has shown that unions’ influence over <b>DM</b> and their <b>responses</b> to it vary by country, but in ways that are not generally expected. Using a qualitative research design based on documentary data analysis and semistructured interviews and a discursive institutionalism (DI) approach, the study compares how DM has been presented in France, Germany and Sweden, and how this affects the extent of social dialogue on <b>DM</b> and union <b>responses</b> to it. It examines unions’ influence on diversity discourses and the implications of these responses for equality agendas. The research has contributed to knowledge and theory of DM and to the field of industrial relations by: applying the recursive DI approach to analysing how national contexts shape DM and vice versa; by combining theories of institutionalisation with Gumbrell-McCormick and Hyman’s (2013) conceptualisation of types of trade union power to reveal models of underlying mechanisms for when, where and why a social dialogue approach to DM is more likely; by analysing the impact of a social dialogue approach on DM; by providing empirical evidence for Gumbrell-McCormick and Hyman’s (2013) proposition that moral and discursive power, rather than structural, associational, organisational and institutional strength, are more important for unions in the ‘battle of ideas’. The research also demonstrates the value of the DI concepts of actors’ ‘background ideational’ and ‘foreground discursive’ abilities for critically evaluating unions’ responses to diversity management in a manner which seeks to avoid both ethnocentrism and cultural relativism...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if <b>DM</b> affects <b>response</b> to neoadjuvant CRT in the management of gastroesophageal carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the esophageal cancer patient databases and subsequently analyzed those patients who received neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgical resection at two institutions, Thomas Jefferson University (TJUH) and Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). Comparative analyses of rates of pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and pathologic downstaging in DM patients versus non-DM patients was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty patients were included in the study; 36 patients had DM and 224 were non-diabetics. The average age of the patients was 61 years (range 24 - 84 years). The overall pCR was 26 %. The pCR rate was 19 % and 27 % for patients with DM and without DM, respectively (P = 0. 31). Pathologic downstaging occurred in 39 % of study patients, including of 33 % of DM patients and 40 % of non-DM patients (P = 0. 42). CONCLUSIONS: Although the current analysis does not demonstrate a significant reduction in pCR rates or pathologic downstaging in patients with DM, the observed trend suggests that a potential difference may be observed with a larger patient population. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the influence of DM on the effectiveness of neoadjuvant CRT in esophageal cancer...|$|R

The 22 published experiments reflected 6 YP, with one being used in 7 experiments, 2 in 6 experiments each, and 3 in one experiment each. There were analytical (i. e., neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and starch) differences (P< 0. 05) in the diets fed, and milk yield, milk energy output and milk fat proportion differences (P< 0. 05) among the control group cows of the experiments of the 3 major (based upon numbers of published studies) YP. However, the proportional milk, milk component, milk energy and dry matter (<b>DM)</b> intake <b>response</b> of the cows to feeding of the 3 major YP did not differ. Simple correlation coefficients of the combined data set (i. e., n = 22) suggested that higher diet NDF or acid detergent fiber (ADF) levels reduced the production response to feeding any YP, while higher diet starch level had little impact. Increased milk and milk energy output of the control cows reduced productive benefits of feeding a YP, and results suggest that the YP milk yield response was absolute (about 0. 9 kg/cow/d) and that it decreased proportional to control group milk yield as control group milk yield increased.
