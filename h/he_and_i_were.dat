25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
500|$|Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems {{reflecting}} a {{preoccupation with the}} teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with [...] "wit and American colloquial language". Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the [...] "salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention {{to the life of}} Jesus Christ" [...] and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the [...] "poetic tradition of Christian devotion" [...] alongside Hopkins, Eliot and Auden. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: [...] "The Savior must have been/ A docile Gentleman–/ To come so far so cold a Day/ For little Fellowmen/ The Road to Bethlehem/ Since <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> Boys/ Was leveled, but for that twould be/ A rugged billion Miles–".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> like, 'Let's just try to write something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.|$|E

[...] "I wanted him to know he didn't need to pay {{attention}} to all this; that he was going to make it through. I know what the next Nirvana record was going to sound like. It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little angry at him for killing himself. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> going to make a trial run of the album. It was set up. He had a plane ticket. At the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E
