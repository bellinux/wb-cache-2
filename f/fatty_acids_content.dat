40|$|Abstract Background Human milk is {{the optimal}} {{nutrition}} for infants. When breastfeeding is not possible, supplementation of infant formula with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids appears to promote neurodevelopmental outcome and visual function. Plant oils, {{that are the}} only source of fat in most of infant formulas, do not contain specific fatty acids that are present in human and cow milk and do not encounter milk fat triglyceride structure. Experimental data suggest that a mix of dairy lipids and plant oils can potentiate endogenous synthesis of n- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This trial aims to determine the effect of an infant formula supplemented with a mixture of dairy lipids and plant oils on the erythrocyte membrane omega- 3 fatty acid profile in full-term infants (primary outcome). Erythrocyte membrane long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> <b>content,</b> the plasma lipid profile and the insulin-growth factor 1 level, the gastrointestinal tolerance, the changes throughout the study in blood <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> <b>content,</b> in growth and body composition are evaluated as secondary outcomes. Methods/Design In a double-blind controlled randomized trial, 75 healthy full-term infants are randomly allocated to receive for four months a formula supplemented with a mixture of dairy lipids and plant oils or a formula containing only plant oils or a formula containing plant oils supplemented with arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Twenty-five breast-fed infants constitute the reference group. Erythrocyte membrane omega- 3 fatty acid profile, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and the other <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> <b>content,</b> the plasma lipid profile and the insulin-growth factor 1 level are measured after four months of intervention. Gastrointestinal tolerance, the changes in blood <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> <b>content,</b> in growth and body composition, assessed by means of an air displacement plethysmography system, are also evaluated throughout the study. Discussion The achievement of an appropriate long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids status represents an important goal in neonatal nutrition. Gaining further insight in the effects of the supplementation of a formula with dairy lipids and plant oils in healthy full-term infants could help to produce a formula whose fat content, composition and structure is more similar to human milk.

One area under investigation in response to these challenges is <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> of forages. This thesis sets out to investigate the variation and relationships between <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> lipids, chlorophyll and other nutritional aspects of perennial ryegrass. Additionally, it will investigate alternative methods to predict <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in forage. The core experiment involved twenty-four genotypes from two perennial ryegrass populations. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were found to increase in leaf material during a growing season. Genotype differences in <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> and composition were found which were broadly consistent across the growing season. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> correlated positively with crude protein but negatively with water-soluble carbohydrates. A positive and consistent relationship was found between chlorophyll and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> across the growing season. The use of a chlorophyll meter to estimate <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> did not perform very well, due to poor relationships with in vitro chlorophyll, however near-infrared reflectance and Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy had acceptable prediction accuracies for use as a screening tool. The accuracies of these prediction methods could be improved with further development using larger datasets. Investigation of the lipid composition revealed that galactolipid proportion was the main contributor to increased total <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> in the high FA genotypes.
