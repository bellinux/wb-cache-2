2500|$|During the climb, {{the crew}} made {{preparations}} to detour around thunderstorms along the aircraft's track; the Captain anticipated turbulence {{and kept the}} passenger seatbelt sign lit. At 02:09, 17 minutes into the flight, as the plane was passing from [...] to , the flight crew heard a loud [...] "thump" [...] which shook the aircraft. A second and a half later, the forward cargo door blew off. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> out {{with such force that}} it passed its normal stop and slammed {{into the side of the}} fuselage, bursting the fuselage open. [...] Pressure differentials and aerodynamic forces caused the cabin floor to cave in, and 10 seats (G and H of rows 8 through 12) were ejected from the cabin. All 8 passengers seated in these locations were killed (seats 8G and 12G were unoccupied), as was the passenger in seat 9F. [...] A gaping hole was left in the aircraft, through which a flight attendant in the business-class cabin was almost blown out of the aircraft. Passengers and crew members saw her clinging to a seat leg and were able to pull her back inside the cabin, although she was severely injured. Senior flight attendant Laura Brentlinger hung on to the steps leading to the upper deck, and was dangling from them when the decompression occurred.|$|E
60|$|Captain Nugent, who {{was moving}} towards the <b>door,</b> <b>swung</b> round and confronted him savagely.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and {{the girl}} came in gasping, with horror in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|As the Sultan spoke, the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} there entered an aged Turk, in a flowing gown and {{coloured}} turban, with a melancholy yellow face, {{and a long}} white beard that swept to his girdle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Mr. Parr, as the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} {{he led the way}} into the house, [...] "I'm sorry I can't give you a more cheerful welcome, but my son and daughter, for their own reasons, see fit to live elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|Outside {{the cathedral}} {{there was the}} sudden blare of trumpets. The great <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> violently open, and the entire throng were upon their feet in an instant as a trooper of the Royal Horse shouted: [...] "The king! The king! Make way for Leopold of Lutha!" ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to sharply just then, and he started. He {{thought it}} was the cannon.|$|E
60|$|The aide-de-camp {{bowed and}} withdrew. In another moment the half-opened <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> wide to Mistress Thankful Blossom.|$|E
60|$|Slowly the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} a man entered the room. Barney breathed a deep sigh of relief--it was Joseph.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted {{his cousin}} {{and her friend}} with genuine heartiness, and readily {{accepted}} their invitation to explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their elbow. The plate-glass <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open and the trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and loiterers.|$|R
50|$|On June 27, 1993, as the Sausages {{approached}} Milwaukee County Stadium on {{the scoreboard}} video, the left field <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open and—much {{to the surprise}} of players and fans—out came the larger-than-life mascots. The three made their way to home plate with The Bratwurst (worn by Dillon) winning the first-ever live race.|$|R
60|$|Trent {{rose and}} opened the <b>door</b> which <b>swung</b> into the little room.|$|R
60|$|The {{ambassador}} {{arranged the}} combination {{and pressed the}} lever. Slowly the great <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> back. The two men peered in.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{open with}} the same {{promptness}} as before. A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|Philip's heart gave a great thud {{against his}} ribs, {{and he let}} the door handle go. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to.|$|E
6000|$|Then my {{lips and}} eyes were sealed with silence and with darkness, so that I was dumb and blind. The Gates rolled back, the <b>Doors</b> <b>swung</b> wide, and I was swept into the city {{that is in the}} Place of Death. I was swept swiftly I know not whither, till at length I stood upon my feet. Again the great Voice pealed: ...|$|R
5000|$|Virginia Woolf made {{reference}} to the British Museum Reading Room in a passage from her 1929 essay, A Room of One's Own. She wrote, [...] "The swing <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open, and there one stood under the vast dome, as if one were a thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled by a band of famous names." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with his}} {{powerful}} fists he began pounding against the panels of the <b>door</b> which <b>swung</b> loosely under the heavy blows.|$|R
60|$|The key {{was turned}} noiselessly in the lock; {{he raised the}} latch, and the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open with never a creak.|$|E
60|$|Semper Idem's {{eyes flashed}} in token that he heard, {{and a moment}} later the {{hospital}} <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to on his heel.|$|E
60|$|Turning to {{the door}} Billy knocked the bar from its place, the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> in and Bridge slipped through to liberty.|$|E
50|$|Other {{avenues of}} escape were {{similarly}} useless; side doors had been bolted shut to prevent people from leaving without paying. A plate glass window, {{which could have}} been smashed for escape, was boarded up and unusable as an emergency exit. Other unlocked doors, like the ones in the Broadway Lounge, opened inwards, rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape. Fire officials would later testify that had the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> outwards, at least 300 lives could have been spared.|$|R
60|$|The <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open, {{and through}} them came a {{procession}} clad in black, {{followed by the}} Shaman Simbri, who walked {{in front of a}} bier, upon which lay the body of the Khan, carried by eight priests. Behind it was Atene, draped in a black veil from head to foot, and after her marched another company of priests. In front of the altar the bier was set down and the priests fell back, leaving Atene and her uncle standing alone before the corpse.|$|R
60|$|They {{heard the}} closing of an {{automobile}} door {{and the sound of}} foot steps coming up the concrete walk. The Prim butler was already waiting at the doorway with the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> wide to receive the prodigal daughter of the house of Prim. A slender figure with bowed head ascended the steps, guided and assisted by the detective. She did not look up at the expectant butler waiting for the greeting he was sure Abigail would have for him; but passed on into the reception hall.|$|R
60|$|He thrust it {{into the}} lock and turned it; the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{smoothly}} open. The policeman laid his hand upon Tavernake's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Safe and sound,' {{replied the}} man with the ash stick. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> heavily after them, and they descended a small flight of steps.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> inward with a swift scrape and jar. Longstreth half entered, haggard, flaming-eyed. Behind him Duane saw Lawson, and indistinctly another man.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{few minutes}} after six that evening when Philip was {{conscious}} of a knock at his <b>door.</b> He <b>swung</b> around in his chair, blinking a little.|$|R
60|$|Instantly <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> {{open at the}} end of that grey hall, {{and through}} them with {{noiseless}} steps, with shadowy wings, floated a being that bore in its arms a child. Before her it stayed, and the light of its starry head illumined the face of the child. She knew it at once--it was that baby brother whose bones lay by the shore of the African sea. It awoke from its sleep, it opened its eyes, it stretched out its arms and smiled at her. Then it was gone.|$|R
60|$|As Thorne was {{forcibly}} {{driven away}} from the <b>door,</b> it <b>swung</b> open and a man sprang out on to the veranda with another close behind, while confused cries went up.|$|R
60|$|Then the Keeper of the Wicket {{passed through}} and she followed, {{after which the}} <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> shut and locked itself with a sharp click.|$|E
60|$|A {{noise in}} the other room startled them both. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and a tall, elderly, dark complexioned man, {{recently}} shaven, hurried into the room.|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked up}} and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, {{starting}} at every trifling sound. Presently the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and a silken page said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{driver had}} hardly ceased {{speaking}} before the <b>doors</b> were <b>swung</b> open, and Ninety-four was drawn {{out with a}} rush and a clatter that sounded like sweetest music in Seth's ears.|$|R
5000|$|When General Knowledge {{spoke in}} the pre-show and was {{explaining}} that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of Albert Einstein, as {{the example of a}} person who used his brain and Ernest P. Worrell (a popular fictional character played by Jim Varney, who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), {{as an example of the}} opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, [...] "Where do you think you are, Disney World?! Get your strollers in line and hustle!", pointing towards the theater as the automatic <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open.|$|R
60|$|Now the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open; one high-sounding title {{after another}} was announced, the personages owning them followed, {{and the place}} was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. But Tom was hardly {{conscious}} {{of the presence of}} these people, so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. He seated himself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another.|$|R
