During his entire six-year term, he was <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books and the negative effect of the system on a child's creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, Swami and Friends. His inaugural speech was focused on this particular problem, and resulted {{in the formation of}} a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E
5|$|With {{the economy}} so <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> crop, Mobile's {{fortunes}} were always tied {{to those of}} cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Hideo Kojima and {{his studio}} Kojima Productions {{were working on}} a new Metal Gear game <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of its main {{characters}} Raiden, a ninja equipped with swords. Unable to continue working on the game, Kojima contacted Minami to ask PlatinumGames to work on it. According to Kojima, PlatinumGames was the only studio capable of working on an action game with sword-based combat. The team added stealth elements to the game finding its system too boring and straightforward. Directed by Kenji Saito, the game, titled , was released in 2013 and received generally positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success. It also became the company's first licensed title.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: he <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> individual to extract a confession {{on which the}} others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E

25|$|And so it {{was with}} As the World Turns, with its slow-moving {{psychological}} character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to As the World Turns throughout its run, and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips' Road of Life), the expanded 30-minute format of As the World Turns enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga.|$|E

The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation—the computer—to handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.|$|E

Bullfrog worked with their sister company Maxis to release Theme Park World in North America under their Sim brand as Sim Theme Park to further establish themselves in the region. Theme Resort, a Theme game based around holiday islands, was in development, but cancelled, and its team joined the development team for Theme Park World. Dungeon Keeper 2 had a new development team led by Nick Goldsworthy, previously an assistant producer for Theme Park at Electronic Arts. During development, Colin Robinson was interviewed {{for the role of}} Bullfrog's chief technical officer, and helped the project become successful. In 2016, Glenn Corpes speculated that Electronic Arts did not understand Molyneux's role at Bullfrog and thought {{he was in charge of}} everything (in fact, he <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> game at a time, and let others carry out their work) and that their response to his departure was to install managers.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E

500|$|Weber saw {{religion}} {{as one of}} the core forces in society. His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise. In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in magic, or what he referred to as [...] "disenchantment of the world".|$|E

The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio.

500|$|The {{only known}} {{credit for the}} film is that it starred William Garwood. Film historian, Q. David Bowers notes that the plot dealing with circumstantial {{evidence}} <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of Lloyd Lonergan's social issues. Lonergan would produce several scenarios featuring the problems with circumstantial evidence being used to obtain convictions. Bowers notes that such convictions were a known social issue, but not a pressing one in 1911. The first such Thanhouser film to tackle the subject was Love and Law released in December 1910. Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution comes not from an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those who value the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts. The reel demonstrates how easily evidence of this sort may be made to entangle and ensnare a totally innocent man..." ...|$|E
