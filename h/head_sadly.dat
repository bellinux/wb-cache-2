6000|$|The {{effect of}} the magic bonbon was still {{powerful}} enough to control the poor senator, who stood upon the rear seat of the carriage and danced energetically all the way home, {{to the delight of}} the crowd of small boys who followed the carriage and the grief of the sober-minded citizens, who shook their <b>heads</b> <b>sadly</b> and whispered that [...] "another good man had gone wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|Finally a {{very wise}} man came from Cumberland, to meet Solomon and see {{which of them}} was the wisest. He was a very big man, and Solomon was a very little man, and so the people all shook their <b>heads</b> <b>sadly</b> and feared Solomon had met his match, for if the Cumberland man was as full of wisdom as Solomon, he had much the {{advantage}} in size.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Found him?' was the {{instantaneous}} {{question of}} both; but Hardy shook his <b>head</b> so <b>sadly,</b> that the Doctor hastily exclaimed, 'What then?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shook his}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly,</b> and drew back {{again with a}} heavy sigh.|$|E

60|$|She {{found no}} {{consolation}} in my words. She only shook her <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing the}} news all was uproar in Ulfstede. The women rushed {{about in a}} distracted state, imploring the few {{helpless}} old men about the place to arm and defend them. To do these veteran warriors justice they did their best. They put the armour that was brought to them on their palsied limbs, but shook their <b>heads</b> <b>sadly,</b> for they felt that although they might die in defence of the household, they could not save it.|$|R
6000|$|He wonderfully glared. [...] "Am I then already {{frightening}} you?" [...] He {{shook his}} <b>head</b> rather <b>sadly.</b> [...] "I'm {{not in the}} least trying yet. There's something," [...] he added after an instant, [...] "that I do want too awfully to ask you." ...|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not release}} the fatal messenger. Slowly {{the point of the}} arrow drooped; the scar upon the brown {{forehead}} faded; the bowstring relaxed; and Tarzan of the Apes, with bowed <b>head,</b> turned <b>sadly</b> into the jungle toward the village of the Waziri.|$|R
60|$|James, by a look, implored {{his mother}} to speak. She understood, and shook her <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E

60|$|Florida looked hesitatingly {{at her for}} a moment, {{and then}} set her candle on the floor and sank wearily into an arm-chair beside the bed. Her hands fell into her lap; her <b>head</b> drooped <b>sadly</b> forward; the light flung the shadow of her face grotesquely exaggerated and {{foreshortened}} upon the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{shook his}} head mournfully, as if deploring that depravity which could cause a boy {{to run away from}} such a tender hearted {{employer}} and from such a desirable position. But even as he shook his <b>head</b> so <b>sadly</b> he looked wistfully at the peanuts, and Mr. Lord observed the look.|$|R
6000|$|Answering wails and {{fragments}} of chanting broke from the women; {{one or two}} cried out, [...] "Take him from the agent!" [...] But the men shook their <b>heads</b> and <b>sadly</b> watched them pass. [...] "He has done a foolish thing; he must now suffer for it," [...] said Crawling Elk.|$|R
60|$|Then he told {{as much as}} {{he could}} about his {{stricken}} brother. Anderson Rover shook his <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was all Samuel Hausermann could tell, and Charles Davis corroborated his statement. Dave {{shook his}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> It {{was the one}} subject upon which she ventured to dispute her brother's infallibility.|$|E
6000|$|She paused, {{and again}} shook her head. [...] "Indeed, I do not know. If you mean, do I love him, as I could love some man whose heart was quite congenial to my own, {{certainly}} I do not." [...] She continued {{to shake her}} <b>head</b> very <b>sadly.</b> [...] "I esteemed him,--when he asked me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{asked this}} with kindly {{interest}} as {{he laid his}} strong hand on the sick man's shoulder; but the doctor shook his <b>head</b> and smiled <b>sadly.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{gave her}} again a silent smile. He had a kindly mouth and probing eyes. And {{he shook his}} <b>head</b> a little <b>sadly,</b> it seemed.|$|R
60|$|During {{the evening}} Ralph {{told his mother}} of Percy Paget's mishap at the dock. She shook her <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> {{and the big}} tears stood in her eyes. There was no mistaking her earnestness now.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Belmont's {{eyes were}} far away, and {{she shook her}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> as she gently put the girl's hands aside.|$|E
6000|$|All eyes swept {{round to}} Wilding {{who sat in}} silence, listening; Monmouth's were laden with inquiry and some anxiety. Wilding shook his <b>head</b> slowly, <b>sadly.</b> [...] "You must not depend upon him," [...] he answered; [...] "Lord Gervase was not yet ripe. A little longer and I think I must have won him for Your Grace." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fleda, drying her eyes, {{shook her}} <b>head</b> ever so <b>sadly.</b> [...] "No, Mrs. Gereth, it isn't over. I can't {{do what you}} ask--I can't meet your condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{regarded}} their nephew {{across the}} supper table with long faces. Kipps exploded with laughter and broke out again when his Aunt shook her <b>head</b> very <b>sadly</b> at him. Then suddenly he fell grave. He {{felt he could}} keep it up no longer. [...] "It's all right, Aunt. Reely. I ain't mad and I ain't been drinking. I been lef' money. I been left twenty-six fousand pounds." ...|$|R
60|$|My father {{shook his}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly</b> as he marked his dusky face and laboured breathing. 'How of your soul?' he asked.|$|E
6000|$|The old man {{shook his}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> 'The King hath great resources,' he remarked. 'Where is Monmouth {{to get his}} trained soldiers?' ...|$|E
60|$|Psmith {{watched him}} lounge from the room, {{and shook his}} <b>head</b> <b>sadly.</b> All was not well with his {{confidential}} secretary and adviser.|$|E
5000|$|Junior's {{personality}} {{reflected a}} degree of respect for his father, though often, when Sylvester does something embarrassing or humiliating, Junior would (melodramatically) often profess feeling ashamed or embarrassed by his father's behavior (sometimes donning a paper bag over his <b>head)</b> or <b>sadly</b> saying, in a breathy voice, [...] "Oh, Father...", [...] "Oh, the shame of it", or [...] "How can I ever face the fellows in Troop 12?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Old Kipps became tactful. [...] "It's a {{very good}} whiskey, my boy," [...] said old Kipps. [...] "I 'aven't the {{slightest}} doubt it's {{a very good}} whiskey and cost you a tidy price. But--dashed if it soots me! They put this here Foozle Ile in it, my boy, and it ketches me jest 'ere." [...] He indicated his centre of figure. [...] "Gives me the heartburn," [...] he said, and shook his <b>head</b> rather <b>sadly.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed at}} first hardly to {{understand}} him, but still regarding {{him with that}} wan face, shook her <b>head</b> slowly and <b>sadly.</b> One might have {{thought that she was}} twenty years older than when Dr Thorne last saw her.|$|R
