40|$|We show numerically {{that the}} nature of the doping induced metal-insulator {{transition}} in the two-dimensional Hubbard model is radically altered by the inclusion of a term, W, which depends upon a square of a single-particle nearest-neighbor hopping. This result is reached by computing the localization length, ξ_l, in the insulating state. At finite values of W we find results consistent with ξ_l ∼ | μ - μ_c|^- 1 / 2 where μ_c is the critical chemical potential. In contrast, ξ_l ∼ | μ - μ_c|^- 1 / 4 for the Hubbard model. At finite values of W, the presented numerical results imply that doping the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator leads to a d_x^ 2 - y ^ 2 superconductor.

40|$|We {{present an}} example of the {{practical}} implementation of a protocol for experimental bifurcation detection based on on-line identification and feedback control ideas. The idea is to couple the experiment with an on-line computer-assisted identification/feedback protocol so that the closed-loop system will converge to the open-loop bifurcation points. We demonstrate the applicability of this instability detection method by real-time, computer-assisted detection of period doubling bifurcations of an electronic circuit; the circuit implements an analog realization of the Roessler system. The method succeeds in locating the bifurcation points even in the presence of modest experimental uncertainties, noise and limited resolution. The results presented here include bifurcation detection experiments that rely on measurements of a single state variable and delay-based phase space reconstruction, as well as {{an example of}} tracing entire segments of a codimension- 1 bifurcation boundary in two parameter space.

This exact sequence involves the equivariant Euler characteristic of X, which we study using an abstract notion of Poincare duality in bivariant K-theory.

40|$|To the Hubbard {{model on}} a square lattice we add an interaction, W, which {{depends upon the}} square of a near-neighbor hopping. We use zero {{temperature}} quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattice sizes up to 16 × 16, to show that at half-filling and constant value of the Hubbard repulsion, the interaction W triggers a quantum transition between an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator and a d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 superconductor. With a combination of finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations and the Maximum Entropy method, we study spin and charge degrees of freedom in the superconducting state. We give numerical evidence for the occurrence of a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 superconducting state. Above and below the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature, T_KT, we compute the one-electron density of states, N(ω), the spin relaxation rate 1 /T_ 1, {{as well as the}} imaginary and real part of the spin susceptibility χ(q⃗,ω). The spin dynamics are characterized by the vanishing of 1 /T_ 1 and divergence of Re χ(q⃗ = (π,π), ω = 0) in the low temperature limit. As T_KT is approached N(ω) develops a pseudo-gap feature and below T_KT Im χ(q⃗ = (π,π), ω) shows a peak at finite frequency.

40|$|The phenomenally large {{enhancement}} in conductivity observed when Li-doped MgO crystals are oxidized at elevated temperatures {{was investigated}} by dc and ac electrical measurements in the temperature interval 250 - 673 K. The concentration of ([Li]^ 0) centers (Li^+ ions {{each with a}} trapped hole) resulting from oxidation was monitored by optical absorption measurements. Both dc and ac experiments provide consistent values for the bulk resistance. The electricalconductivity of oxidized MgO:Li crystals increases linearly with the concentration of ([Li]^ 0) centers. The conductivity is thermally activated with an activation energy of (0. 70 +/- 0. 01) eV, which is independent of the ([Li]^ 0) content. The standard semiconducting mechanism satisfactorily explains these results. Free holes are the main contribution to band conduction as they are trapped at or released from the ([Li]^ 0) -acceptor centers. In as-grown MgO:Li crystals, electrical current increases dramatically with time due {{to the formation of}} ([Li]^ 0) centers. The activation energy values between 1. 3 and 0. 7 eV are likely a combination of the activation energy for the creation of ([Li]^ 0) centers and the activation energy of ionization of these centers. Destruction of ([Li]^ 0) centers can be induced in oxidized crystals by application of an electric field due to Joule heating up to temperatures at which ([Li]^ 0) centers are not stable.

We find that photoelectric opacity causes significant attenuation of photons with energies above the O VIII K-edge; that the conversion efficiencies of these photons into lower-energy lines and recombination continua are high; and that accounting for this reprocessing significantly (by factors of 21 % to 105 %) increases the flux of the Ly alpha and He alpha emission lines of H- and He-like C and O escaping the disk atmosphere.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the grid format of bitmap images, Vector graphics file formats use geometric modeling to describe an image {{as a series of}} points, lines, curves, and polygons. Because the image is described using geometric data instead of fixed pixels, the image can be scaled to any size while retaining [...] "resolution independence", meaning that the image can be printed at the highest resolution a printer supports, resulting in a clear, crisp image. Vector file formats are usually superior in resolution and ease of editing as compared to bitmap file formats, but are not as widely supported by software and are not well-suited for storing pixel-specific data such as scanned photographs. In the early years of electronic clip art, vector illustrations were limited to simple line art representations. However, by the early 2000s, vector illustration tools could produce virtually the same illustrations as bitmap illustration tools, while still providing all of the advantages of vector file formats. The most common vector file format is Adobe's EPS (<b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript)</b> file <b>format.</b> Microsoft has a much simpler, less sophisticated vector file format called WMF (Windows Metafile). The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a new, XML-based vector file format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and all major modern web browsers - including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari have at least some degree of support for SVG and can render the markup directly.

In addition, I drawn attention to a correlation, valid over nearly six orders of magnitude in frequency, between the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole binaries. This correlation identifies the high frequency quasi-coherent oscillations (so-called ``dwarf nova oscillations'') of CVs with the kilohertz QPOs of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and the low frequency and low coherence QPOs of CVs with the horizontal branch oscillations (or the broad noise component identified as such) of LMXBs. Assuming that the same mechanisms produce the QPOs of white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole binaries, this correlation {{has important implications for}} QPO models.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the very precise de Jager et al. optical white dwarf orbit and spin ephemerides; ASCA, XMMN, and Chandra X-ray observations spread over 10 yrs; and a cumulative 27 yr baseline, {{we have found that}} in recent years the white dwarf in AE Aqr is spinning down at a rate that is slightly faster than predicted by the de Jager et al. spin ephemeris. At the present time, the observed period evolution is consistent with either a cubic term in the spin ephemeris with Pdouble_dot = 3. 46 (56) E- 19 per d, which is inconsistent in sign and magnitude with magnetic-dipole radiation losses, or an additional quadratic term with Pdot = 2. 0 (1. 0) E- 15 d/d, which is consistent with a modest increase in the accretion torques spinning down the white dwarf. Regular monitoring, in the optical, ultraviolet, and/or X-rays, is required to track the evolution of the spin period of the white dwarf in AE Aqr.

We find quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at nu_ 0 ~ 0. 012 Hz and nu_ 1 ~ 0. 13 Hz in the EUV flux and at nu_ 0 ~ 0. 0090 Hz, nu_ 1 ~ 0. 11 Hz, and possibly nu_ 2 ~ nu_ 0 + nu_ 1 ~ 0. 12 Hz {{in the soft}} X-ray flux.

This correlation identifies the high-frequency quasi-coherent oscillations (so-called ``dwarf nova oscillations'') of cataclysmic variables (CVs) with the kilohertz QPOs of LMXBs, and the low-frequency QPOs of CVs with the horizontal branch oscillations (or the broad noise component identified as such) of LMXBs.
