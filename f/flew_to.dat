5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. He <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E

50|$|Often, the {{low-cost}} carriers <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> smaller, less congested secondary airports and/or <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> {{airports in}} off-peak hours to avoid air traffic delays {{and take advantage}} of lower landing fees. This is why Ryanair <b>flies</b> <b>to</b> Gatwick Airport, Luton Airport, and Stansted Airport in the London area and how easyJet is able <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and Amsterdam. In London's case however, low-cost carriers wouldn't be able to use Heathrow anyway as the airport is running at near capacity, so there is no room to build a base. The airlines tend to offload, service and re-load the aircraft (turnaround) in shorter time periods and don't wait for late passengers, allowing maximum utilization of aircraft.|$|R
