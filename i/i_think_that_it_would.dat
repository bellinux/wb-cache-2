60|$|Newton {{was a great}} man, but {{you must}} excuse me if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take many Newtons to make one Milton.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank your Grace. For the {{purposes}} of my investigation, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be wiser for me to remain {{at the scene of}} the mystery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon further consideration, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be better}} to summon all the {{officers}} of the regiment, at once, and to impress upon them the necessity for keeping silence on the matter." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is going}} to rain.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Sun {{has risen}} {{every day in}} the past, {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will not rise tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I call it {{human and}} reasonable; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{compatible}} with duty and affection. Have you consulted her wishes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{influence}} {{will not}} protect you against {{the point of}} a dagger," [...] Giuseppi said. [...] "Your share in this business cannot but become public, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be wise to give up our evening excursions at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} {{a great deal}} more than I meant to, Mr. Ducaine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been better if I had left most of it unsaid. You must go your own way. I only wanted to guard you against disappointment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is playing}} with her nephew," [...] said Harold at last. [...] "The Walkers have not come out yet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be well {{if you were to}} give me that cheque, mother, and I were to return it in person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And by that time, perhaps," [...] she said, [...] "one's {{affections}} are hopelessly engaged. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a {{very difficult}} world." ...|$|R
60|$|Be it so. I {{hope it is}} so. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is not so easy}} {{to believe}} it as we fancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those being your sentiments, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a {{pity the}} duty is not intrusted to some officer of broader views." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} would be so, master," [...] Paolo said thoughtfully; [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be best for me that the king should not take it into his head to give me that estate. And {{so we are going}} to Geneva, master?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The news is bad from Poitou, Colonel Campbell, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{well that}} you should proceed there at once. So we will release you from further attendance, {{and you can make}} up for it by giving us a longer time on your return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{secure the}} men we shall get the treasure. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a {{pleasure}} to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her {{be the first to}} open it.--Eh, Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least idea; it might be {{anything}}. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> tasted, to me, more like stewed eels than anything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{must think}} it over," [...] Mr. Prendergast said quietly. [...] "And now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is time for}} me to join the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{only the}} monstrous conceit of mankind which makes him <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all this stage was erected for him to strut upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forty {{thousand}} pounds' {{worth of}} shares," [...] Letitia continued, [...] "which are worth as much now as {{when my father}} bought them, are, I suppose, nothing to you. I wondered whether you would object to have them back again? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> relieve my father's mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] I protested. [...] "We, too, {{have our}} {{sentiment}}, the sentiment of places {{as well as}} of people. If I could choose where to die <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be here, with my windows wide open and the roar of the incoming tide in my ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good and kind. I wish to Heaven that I were going to Marlshire with you. If you only knew how I long to see her again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> break my heart if {{anything}} happened to separate us," [...] and his lips quivered at the thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{you believe}} <b>it</b> I hope <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is true; indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be true, Mother dear," [...] said Isobel {{with a little}} sob.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{my duty to}} put a stop, a {{peremptory}} stop {{to anything}} like a love affair between my son and your niece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} {{game played}} {{through to the end}} by masters, and you, my dear woman, are the inspiration. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is most fascinating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah yes, {{the plan}} seems a {{satisfactory}} one, {{but of course}} in so important a matter I should prefer to consult my legal adviser before giving a final answer, indeed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better if the whole affair were carried out in a proper and formal way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never wished you to," [...] {{she said}} coldly. [...] "However, {{we will not}} talk about that. For certain reasons <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be well {{for you to be}} married before you {{actually}} come of age. That is why I have invited the Count de Brensault here to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the first}} time," [...] she said. [...] "Another girl and her mother have lived with me always. They started off last week, touring. They are paying a little toward the house or I should {{have to go into}} rooms. As it is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{chain is}} up and down, sir. Shall I make sail? The wind is very light, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is enough to take her out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{affection for}} Tredowen," [...] she {{repeated}} wonderingly. [...] "Do {{you know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Pengarth? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is the most beautiful}} house in the world!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask no payment," [...] Rachel {{answered}} wearily, {{when she}} understood the words; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is <b>I</b> who need protection from that wicked dwarf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Rawlins, I do {{not quite}} like {{the look of}} things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be as well {{if you were to}} gather as many of the hands as you can {{at the foot of the}} ladder here, without, of course, {{alarming}} the natives, as it may be only my fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have a case,' said he, 'but by {{no means}} a certainty. It all depends upon how the judge might read the document. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{strengthen}} our case very materially if we had counsel's opinion. I'll copy the bond and show it to Manners, and have his opinion before you go back to-night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} a good deal in that, Harrington. If Faulkner had not died <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been best merely to hold the warrant over in order that when Wyatt comes back, if he ever does come back, all these facts might be proved publicly; now that will all be done before the coroner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, father. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will {{be rather}} a large thing. At any rate there is {{something}} between eighty and a hundred tons of them." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{my opinion}} the link up {{is a very}} {{positive}} move for both clubs and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{will prove to be}} very successful over the coming years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{does not}} {{interest}} me to fence with words. Between us <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not necessary. What {{do you want}} with me?" ...|$|R
