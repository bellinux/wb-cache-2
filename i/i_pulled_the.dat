500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, {{described}} the events: [...] "I received {{the green light}} from the tower and we began our take-off run. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> stick back and the aircraft started to climb. When I was at 150ft I pushed the controls of the aircraft forward to gain speed. Suddenly I discovered I {{was not able to}} pull the stick back. The steering mechanism was jammed or locked." [...] The aircraft then lost height rapidly. Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|E
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E

2500|$|Colleen Hewett married Danny Finley (ex-MPD Ltd, drummer) in 1970, he {{was also}} her manager and agent during the 1970s and 1980s. The couple had three children. From 1978 Finley also managed John Farnham; in mid-1979 Hewett, Finley and Farnham were {{partners}} in a restaurant, Backstage in Melbourne. Farnham described the venture [...] " [...] were putting their names {{on the line for}} a product they had complete trust in. They would have complete control of the restaurant, but would leave the menu management to the master chef". However the venture was [...] "ill-fated" [...] and became a [...] "near disaster" [...] financially. In October 1980 Finley assisted Johnny Young on his Young Talent Time and related TV ventures. Hewett and Finley divorced. She later recalled [...] "I suppose you expect there to be something terrible or a nasty fight, but there wasn't ... <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> pin". Finley subsequently became her manager again.|$|E
2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind him, I would get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E

60|$|To wait, {{listening}} again, in {{the darkness}} of that unknown region, was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the floor, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> lantern out of my pocket and raised the shade.|$|E

60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Desire!' said Gudrun, coldly, {{stiffening}} a little. 'I can't {{see that}} they were even playing at killing.

60|$|Frank's wooing {{seemed to}} prosper. The other young sparks, who had haunted Glenby, faded away after his advent.

6000|$|... "I {{lifted my}} rifle; I {{scrutinized}} its every portion; {{it was in}} order. Then I leaned {{over the edge of}} the car and pointed it downward.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> two quills {{with sharp}} jerks {{out of my}} hand, pushed all the others through my coat sleeve, and turned to Unk Wunk again, sucking my wounded hand, which pained me intensely.

6000|$|... "I thought I did, father.
