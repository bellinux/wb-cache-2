We show that <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bonds</b> may be successfully applied during privatization of state companies throughout the world. It may be profitable for many reasons. Firstly, the exchangeables offer a much lower coupon {{in comparison with the}} ordinary government bonds which may be crucial for highly indebted countries. Secondly, throughout the entire maturity period the state remains the owner of the privatized firm which means that the government can be a beneficiary of high dividends paid by the public enterprises and can actively manage them. Thirdly, in the case of unfavorable market conditions the authorities get an opportunity to wait for the end of economic turmoil in order to avoid selling the equity participations under their true value. Finally, the issue of certain types of exchangeables (e. g. callable exchangeables or mandatory exchangeables) and adding several provisions (e. g. greenshoe option or clean-up call) makes the instrument more flexible for the issuer. We also present a few examples of the privatization processes by means of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bonds</b> i. a. in Germany and in Austria. Most of such operations, e. g.

40|$|Historically, most {{convertible}} bond (CB) {{issues have been}} converted to equity sooner or later. The announcement of a CB issue will bring about a future dilution of the firm's capital, and is often followed by a drop in share price. However, a CB issue by itself creates future value for the shareholders if it enables the firm to make profitable investments. It can also issue a positive signal regarding the restructuring of the firm's financial liabilities and its attempts to optimise its financial structure. These positive effects, if they occur, will develop gradually after the issue, and cannot be identified by a simple short-term event analysis of a CB issue announcement. In this paper, we test {{the significance of the}} dilution effect, coupled with a possible value creation effect, using data from the French stock market. We introduce a comparison between dilutive convertibles and non-dilutive <b>exchangeable</b> <b>bonds.</b> By integrating different corrections and by selecting a window of analysis over a longer period after the announcement of the issue, we show that the negative cumulative average abnormal returns generally observed in previous studies become non-significant.

These permanent networks are insoluble and infusible, but the network topology can be reshuffled at high temperatures, thus enabling glasslike plastic deformation and reprocessing without depolymerization. We disclose herein the development of functional and high-value ion-conducting vitrimers that take inspiration from poly(ionic liquid) s. Tunable networks with high ionic content are obtained by the solvent- and catalyst-free polyaddition of an alpha-azide-omega-alkyne monomer and simultaneous alkylation of the resulting poly(1, 2, 3 -triazole) s with a series of difunctional cross-linking agents. Temperature-induced transalkylation exchanges of C-N bonds between 1, 2, 3 -triazolium cross-links and halide-functionalized dangling chains enable recycling and reprocessing of these highly cross-linked permanent networks. They can also be recycled by depolymerization with specific solvents able to displace the transalkylation equilibrium, and they display a great potential for applications that require solid electrolytes with excellent mechanical performances and facile processing such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and separation membranes...|$|R

40|$|Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides in all organisms. In all Class Ia RNRs, initiation of nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) reduction requires a reversible oxidation over 35 Å by a tyrosyl radical (Y 122 •, Escherichia coli) in subunit β of a cysteine (C 439) in the active site of subunit α. This radical transfer (RT) occurs by a specific pathway involving redox active tyrosines (Y 122 ⇆ Y 356 in β to Y 731 ⇆ Y 730 ⇆ C 439 in α); each oxidation necessitates loss of a proton coupled to loss of an electron (PCET). To study these steps, 3 -aminotyrosine was site-specifically incorporated in place of Y 356 -β, Y 731 - and Y 730 -α, and each protein was incubated with the appropriate second subunit β(α), CDP and effector ATP to trap an amino tyrosyl radical (NH 2 Y•) in the active α 2 β 2 complex. High-frequency (263 GHz) pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the NH 2 Y•s reported the gx values with unprecedented resolution and revealed strong electrostatic effects caused by the protein environment. 2 H electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy accompanied by quantum chemical calculations provided spectroscopic evidence for hydrogen bond interactions at the radical sites, i. e., two <b>exchangeable</b> H <b>bonds</b> to NH 2 Y 730 •, one to NH 2 Y 731 • and none to NH 2 Y 356 •.

Animals were assigned to four groups (n = 3, in each), including a control and groups that received deuterium oxide (2 H 2 O) for 4 days, 7 days or 14 days. Deuterium labelling was initiated by an intraperitoneal injection of 10 μL/g body weight of 99. 9 % 2 H 2 O-saline, and was maintained by administration of 5 % (v/v) 2 H 2 O in drinking water provided ad libitum. Homogenates of the isolated muscles were analysed by 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. Proteins were identified against the SwissProt database using peptide mass fingerprinting.

Cross-linked polymers with <b>exchangeable</b> dynamic covalent <b>bond</b> at room temperature were synthesized by polyaddition of DABBF-tetraol and tolylene diisocyanate terminated polypropylene glycol. The self-healing property of the DABBF-containing cross-linked polymer gel was investigated under air at room temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The water {{gained by}} two micas during a wet-grinding process (extra-water) has been evaluated. It {{was found to}} be {{proportional}} to the surface area and the amount was about 29 /~moles/m ~ for a fluorphlogopite and about 16 /~moles/m 2 for a muscovite. This estimation was made possible by eliminating the physically adsorbed water. The material contaminating the surfaces and the constitution water of muscovite were taken into account by the comparison of the two minerals and by the use of infrared spectroscopy in addition to thermo-volumetric data. It is thought hat the extra-water is related to a disordered and chemically modified surface layer of the particles. The bearing of these results on the nature of iUite is indicated. Many finely ground silicates are found to have a higher water content than the unground material and to lose a part of it at temperatures as low as 100 - 400 ~ C (Mackenzie & Milne, 1953 a,b; Kelly, Jenny & Brown, 1936). Even anhydrous ilicates appear to take up some water either during or after grinding. It has been described as physical ly adsorbed, interlamellar, associated with <b>exchangeable</b> protons, broken <b>bond,</b> and crystall ine water of the surface region. Possibly many of these kinds of water occur together but no accurate research has been done to distinguish between them and to evaluate their respective amounts. It is probable that a surface is always disordered as compared with the regular arrangement of atoms within a crystal (Wade et al., 1961). After a long dry-grinding process the disorder may be important enough to produce considerable amorphous mater ia l as observed by Takahashi (1959) and others. This effect is perhaps diminished by wet-grinding; however, keeping a powdered silicate in water may result in heterogeneous particle...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional layered nano composites, {{which include}} layered double {{hydroxides}} (LDHs), hydroxy double salts (HDSs) and layered hydroxide salts (LHSs) {{are able to}} intercalate different molecular species within their gallery space. These materials have a tunable structural composition which has made them applicable as fire retardants, adsorbents, catalysts, catalyst support materials, and ion exchangers. Thermal treatment of these materials results in destruction of the layers and formation of mixed metal oxides (MMOs) and spinels. MMOs {{have the ability to}} adsorb anions from solution and may also regenerate layered structures through a phenomenon known as “memory effect”. Zinc-nickel hydroxy nitrate was used for the uptake of a series of halogenated acetates (HAs). HAs are pollutants introduced into water systems as by-products of water chlorination and pesticide degradation; their sequestration from water is thus crucial. Optimization of layered materials for controlled uptake requires an understanding of their ion-exchange kinetics and thermodynamics. Exchange kinetics of these anions was monitored using ex-situ PXRD, UV-vis, HPLC and FTIR. It was revealed that exchange rates and uptake efficiencies are related to electronic spatial extents and the charge on carboxyl-oxygen atoms. In addition, acetate and nitrate-based HDSs were used to explore how altering the hydroxide layer affects uptake of acetate/nitrate ions. Changing the metal identities affects the interaction of the anions with the layers. From FTIR, we observed that nitrates coordinate in a D 3 h and Cs/C 2 v symmetry; the nitrates in D 3 h symmetry were easily <b>exchangeable.</b> Interlayer hydrogen <b>bonding</b> was also revealed to be dependent on metal identity. Substituting divalent cations with trivalent cations produces materials with a higher charge density than HDSs and LHSs. A comparison of the uptake efficiency of zinc-aluminum, zinc-gallium and zinc-nickel hydroxy nitrates was performed using trichloro acetic acid as target anion. Uptake efficiency was better for LDHs than HDS, and between the LDHs, zinc-aluminum hydroxy nitrate was the best material for the uptake of tClAc.
