40|$|ABSTRACT We review {{available}} data {{on drug use}} {{with respect to the}} spread of HIV/AIDS in South America and the Caribbean. Although many information gaps remain, the emerging picture clearly shows the significant role of both injected cocaine and crack cocaine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian epidemic, and the increasingly large role of injecting cocaine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Cone. The Caribbean and <b>the</b> <b>Ande</b> an regions are thus far spared from extensive diffusion of injecting drugs and its consequences.

40|$|Soil erosion is {{considered}} as {{a serious threat to}} agricultural development in developing countries. Soil and water conservation measures, such as terraces, are often promoted to combat soil erosion and to increase agricultural production. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> short-term impact of bench terraces, 2 – 4 years after their establishment, on soil properties and maize yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian Andes is analysed and discussed. The results show that bench terraces did not result in any short term change in soil properties, such as fertility or infiltration capacity. Nevertheless, the bench terraces resulted in 20 % higher yields, due to a higher planting density, compared with adjacent sloping fields. However, this increase in yield was nullified by the loss of area occupied by the bench terraces. Bench terraces should therefore be accompanied with other measures to intensify agriculture, such as irrigation or cash crops, to improve the profitability and uptake of bench terraces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ande...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) is {{a family}} of {{learning}} algorithms that range from low variance coupled with high bias through to high variance coupled with low bias. The asymptotic error of the lowest bias variant is the Bayes optimal. <b>The</b> <b>AnDE</b> family of algorithms have a training time that is linear {{with respect to the}} training examples, learn in a single pass through the data, support incremental learning, handle missing values directly and are robust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of noise. These characteristics make the algorithms particularly well suited to learning from large data. However, for higher orders of n they are very computationally demanding. This paper presents data structures and algorithms developed to reduce both memory and time for training and classification. These enhancements have enabled the evaluation and comparison of A 3 DE’s effectiveness. The results provide further support for the hypothesis that as the number of training examples increases, decreasing error will be attained by members of <b>the</b> <b>AnDE</b> family with increasing levels of n...|$|R

Aim: To demonstrated antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects of these extracts, evaluating {{the effect of a}} topical treatment with an aqueous solution of avelós latex on the survival and on intestinal adhesions in rats with experimental peritonitis. Methods: Peritonitis was induced in 24 Wistar rats, that were randomized into four groups of six as follows: (1) Control group (n= 6), no treatment; (2) Antibiotic group (n= 6), treatment with a single intramuscular dose of antibiotic Unasyn; (3) Saline group (n= 6), the abdominal cavity was washed with 0. 9 % saline; and (4) E. tirucalli group (n= 6), the abdominal cavity was washed with E. tirucalli at a concentration of 12 mg/ml. The animals that died were necropsied, and the time of death was recorded. The survivors were killed on postoperative day 11, and necropsy was subsequently performed for evaluation of the intestinal adhesions. Results: Significant differences were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control and antibiotic groups (p 0. 05) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survival of animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saline <b>andE.</b> tirucalli groups; however, one animal died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saline group.

40|$|Recent reports {{suggest that}} Mycobacterium is better adapted to soils {{containing}} poorly bioavailable {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) compared to Sphingomonas. To study this hypothesis, artificial conditions regarding PAH profile and PAH bioavailability were induced in two PAH-contaminated soils and {{the response of the}} eubacterial, Mycobacterium, and Sphingomonas communities to these changed conditions was monitored during laboratory incubation. Soil K 3663 with a relatively high proportion of high molecular weight PAHs was amended with phenanthrene or pyrene to artificially change the soil into a soil with a relatively increased bioavailable PAH contamination. Soil AndE with a relatively high proportion of bioavailable low molecular weight PAHs was treated by a single-step Tenax extraction to remove the largest part of the easily bioavailable PAH contamination. In soil K 3663, the added phenanthrene or pyrene compounds were rapidly degraded, concomitant with a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of phenanthrene and pyrene degraders, and minor and no changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mycobacterium community and Sphingomonas community, respectively. However, a transient change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eubacterial community related to the proliferation of several gamma-proteobacteria was noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phenanthrene-amended soil. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> extracted <b>AndE</b> soil, <b>the</b> Sphingomonas community initially developed into a more diverse community but finally decreased <b>in</b> size below <b>the</b> detection limit.
