In {{the vicinity of}} Tcomp, the conduction electron polarization (CEP) assumes {{the role of a}} soft ferromagnet exchange coupled to a pseudo-antiferromagnet comprising Nd/Ho moments, resulting in an asymmetry in the hysteretic (<b>M-H)</b> <b>loop,</b> i. e., the notion of an exchange bias field (Hexch). Across Tcomp, the CEP contribution reverses sign, and in consonance, the asymmetry in the <b>M-H</b> <b>loop</b> also undergoes a phase reversal. Interestingly, the width of the <b>M-H</b> <b>loop</b> shows a divergence, followed by a collapse on approaching Tcomp from either end. The observed behavior confirms a long standing prediction based on a phenomenological model for ferrimagnetic systems. The field induced changes across Tcomp leave an imprint of a quasi-phase transition in the heat capacity data.

Direct measurements of hysteretic loss vs applied field sweep amplitude, Hm, give a pseudo-Meissner field, HPS 1, of 2 kOe for the round wire sample in reasonable agreement with calculation. The hysteretic loss above HpSl (and below the penetration field) was found to fit well to an expression proportional to (H-HPS 1) 3.

Upon increasing the tTa from 0 to 2. 5 nm, the estimated SQR⊥ (=Mr⊥/Ms⊥) from the <b>M-H</b> <b>loops</b> is found to decrease moderately; while the tilt angle magnetization (θM) increases significantly from 43 to 77 °.
