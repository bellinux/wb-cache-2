60|$|Sergeant Cuff {{stopped short}} in the dark, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|Waster Lunny {{pulled his}} chair nearer me and rested <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood there}} fidgeting {{about for a}} bit, and then he puts <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, {{sticking}} {{his hair}} upright with both hands, and then putting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees, 'I am married!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I put my broom agin the wall, and {{we walked}} round to the Bull’s Head like a couple o’ brothers. We ’ad two pints apiece, and then he put <b>his</b> <b>’and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} and talked as man to man.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed and}} put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} as he bade me good night.|$|E
60|$|Betteredge laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, {{and stopped}} me before I could say any more.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he came to}} {{the library}} where I was moping, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that at once. If true, it'll be terrible for Mercedes and me. But Rojas will never get <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> wife. If I can't kill him, I'll kill her!... Belding, this is tough on you--this risk we put upon your family. I regret--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{does her}} wickedness come from?" [...] he went on. [...] "Not from her mother; not from me; {{not from a}} {{neglected}} education." [...] He suddenly stepped {{up to me and}} laid <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders; <b>his</b> voice dropped to hoarse, moaning, awestruck tones. [...] "Shall I tell you what it is? A possession of the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said more}} than this, {{but this is the}} pith of it.

60|$|He {{shook out}} his pipe, and getting {{down from his}} high seat laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee.|$|E
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} {{and gave me}} a slight turn, pointing with his other arm at the same time.|$|E
60|$|Once, indeed, he put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. It was an {{investiture}} of the Star of India, blue silk, trumpets, and diamond-studded jewel, all complete.

6000|$|... "Pip," [...] said he, putting <b>his</b> large <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} and moving {{me to the}} window, [...] "I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{then that}} I 'ad been done, and I was just walking out o' the shop, {{pretending to be}} deaf, when Mr. Watson {{come back with a}} silly young {{policeman}} wot asked me wot I meant by it. He told me to get off 'ome quick, and actually put <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, but it 'ud take more than a thing like that to push me, and, arter trying his 'ardest, he could only rock me a bit.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bundercombe laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> compellingly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. [...] "Who's the wizened-up little insect, with a snarl on his face?" [...] {{he inquired}} of me earnestly.|$|R
60|$|Cavor {{came to my}} {{side and}} laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. His pale and terrified face was ghastly in the blue light.|$|E
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. I shuddered at {{the thought}} that for {{anything}} I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.|$|E
6000|$|He looked long at my boots--a pair of Russia leather, and {{his face}} seemed to regain steadiness. Putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> instep, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|John de Lancie {{deliberately}} {{missed his}} first audition for Q {{as he was}} appearing as a lead in a play at the time.

I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was." ...|$|R
5000|$|Caron Butler is a Christian. After Butler {{was sent}} to a {{juvenile}} institution, he began to change his life by reading Bible verses.

Butler spoke of it saying, [...] "God puts stuff in front of you for a reason." [...] Butler also said, [...] "God put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> life. God said, ‘I’m going to touch you so that you can touch others.’" ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Parker {{rose to his}} feet. He put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. He was {{the very}} {{prototype}} of the self-respecting, conscientious, prospective father- in-law.|$|E
6000|$|As I turned away, {{one of the}} gentlemen, a victim, {{noted for}} his {{sporting}} propensities, followed me, and laying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, asked:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{state of}} happy {{unconsciousness}} had scarcely lasted--it seemed to me--two minutes, when I {{was awakened by}} Peterkin laying <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder and saying-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he said, {{with his}} eyes fixed <b>on</b> mine, and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> still <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. [...] "If I don't tell her, nobody shall tell her for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He lays <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>my</b> draft. [...] "Master Dawe," [...] he says, [...] "do {{you know}} the present price of gold leaf for all this wicked gilding of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{called him}} [...] "Fritz." [...] He drew his chair close to mine, and laid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> affectionately <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. I {{began to think}} I had perhaps {{encouraged}} him a little too readily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By the by, Wickfield,' he said, {{stopping}} in a passage with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder; 'you {{have not found}} any suitable provision for my wife's cousin yet?' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{he stole}} {{up to us}} again, and {{suddenly}} clapping <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Treated Duncan? Oh, pshaw! This is {{far more}} serious affair than a boy's quarrel. Don't let him escape, Parsons"-- the last to the constable, who had <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|I {{kept the}} {{advantage}} over Greaser, {{but still he}} punished me cruelly. Suddenly he got <b>his</b> snaky <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> throat and began to choke me. With all my might I swung my fist into his stomach.|$|R
