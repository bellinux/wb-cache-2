The use of the original 3 ω-Volklein method has allowed the extraction of both the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of each SiN membrane over a wide temperature range. The mechanical properties of the same substrates have been measured at helium temperatures using nanomechanical techniques. Our measurements show that the thermal transport in freestanding SiN membranes is not affected {{by the presence of}} internal stress. Consistently, mechanical <b>dissip...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We show that, if solar 5 min. {{oscillations}} {{are excited}} by convection {{in the upper}} layers of the convective envelope, {{it is impossible to}} explain the opposite line asymmetries observed in the velocity and intensity spectra with assumptions on the <b>dissip</b> ations which reduce the problem to a second order one. The interpretation of that observation requires to solve the full nonadiabatic problem which is of the fourth or sixth order. We also analyze the causes of line asymmetries in the frame of the gene ral problem and we show that to locate the source, it is better to study line asymmetries not too far from line centers.

40|$|We have {{documented}} {{reports of the}} 	 mudbanks along the south-west coast 	 between Mangalore and Quilon for well over 	 three hundred years. However, sequential 	 record of their occurrence {{in time and space}} is 	 wanting. This phenomenon in Kerala, typi	 cally as occurs south of Alleppey (^Fig. 1), is 	 known as Chakara. or Santhakara ("quiet 	 shores"). During the last two decades the 	 presence or absence of the Chakara pheno	 menon has attracted considerable attention of 	 the fisheries sector, resulting in a number of 	 useful studies on mudbanks covering specific 	 aspects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{treatment}} of discontinuities in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. In particular we discuss the difference between integral and differential representations of the fluid equations in an SPH context and how this relates to the formulation of <b>dissip</b> ative terms for the capture of shocks and other discontinuities. This {{has important implications for}} many problems, in particular related to recently highlighted problems in treating Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across entropy gradients in SPH. The specific problems pointed out by Agertz et al. (2007) are shown to be related in particular to the (lack of) treatment of contact discontinuities in standard SPH formulations which can be cured by the simple application of an artificial thermal conductivity term. We propose a new formulation of artificial thermal conductivity in SPH which minimises dissipation away from discontinuities and can therefore be applied quite generally in SPH calculations.

40|$|In this PhD thesis, GaN-on-Si HEMTs (high {{electron}} mobility transistors) have been studied. III-N materials (GaN, AlGaN, AlN) are very useful sy stems {{to be used}} at high voltage and under high ambient temperature owin g to their excellent intrinsic properties, such as wide band gap and low intrinsic carrier concentration. The III-N hetero-structure (AlGaN/GaN) leads {{to the formation of}} a 2 -DEG (two dimensional electron gas) with h igh carrier density, high mobility and high saturation velocity which ca n be utilized to realize an efficient compact power conversion system. G aN-on-Si HEMTs are cost effective solutions but in the scope of this PhD, it is sketched out that the parasitic conduction across the AlN/Si int erface leads to device breakdown voltage saturation after a certain gate -drain distance. This saturation could be elevated by using thick buffer s on Si; however, growing thick buffers are problematic due to the large lattice and thermal mismatch between III-N and Si. In this PhD work, novel Si substrate removal approaches to terminate the AlN/Si interface conduction to enhance the breakdown voltage of AlGaN/G aN/AlGaN-DHFETs has been studied extensively. Various technological appr oaches starting from Global Si substrate removal (GSSR) -to-Local Si r emoval between S-to-D contacts (LRSD) -to- Si trench around drain conta ct (STAD)  have been developed. After Si removal, a linear increase in t he breakdown voltage with the gate-drain distance is measured compared t o a saturated breakdown voltage on Si. A breakdown voltage of over ~ 200 0 V is measured for a gate-drain distance of 20 &# 956;m and a buffer thi ckness of only 2 &# 956;m. The main thrust from GSSR-to-LRSD-to-STAD is d riven by enhancing device thermal performance. In case of a STAD device (compared to a GSSR or a LRSD device), the Si substrate is still under t he gate-region where the maximum heat is generated which helps to <b>dissip</b> ate the generated heat; confirmed by electrical measurements and thermal simulations. It is presented that after Si removal, devices have un-alt ered threshold voltages (VTH); confirming no change in 2 -DEG channel pro perties. Other advantages of Si substrate removal include: (1) high volt age operation under high ambient temperature is possible compared to the devices with Si and (2) the device breakdown voltage is independent of the buffer thickness leading to ~ 2000 V breakdown for a sub-micron thin (600 nm) AlGaN buffer layer. Therefore optimization of thin buffers followed by Si substrate removal {{is one of the most}} attractive solutions towards obtaining low cost, high yield and high manufacturability of GaN power devices fabricated on Si substrates. status: publishe...|$|E
