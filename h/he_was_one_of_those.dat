5|$|In 1860, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{politicians}} who forced Prime Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Jan Jacob Rochussen, his former Governor-General, to resign his post, {{in part because}} a corruption scandal in the East Indies came to light. In that same year he promoted his friend Multatuli's Max Havelaar, announcing in parliament that the book had sent tremors through the country.

5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E

5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales {{did not keep}} any notes and later proved unable to remember {{much of what the}} prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating {{at the time of her}} death.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} ever {{attempted}} military coup in Nigeria on 15 January 1966 Remilekun Fani-Kayode together {{with a number of}} other notable figures were all detained by the military government of General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. They were later released in July 1966, after the northern counter-coup, led by Lt. Col. Murtala Muhammed and Major Theophilus Danjuma. After Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon became Nigeria's Head of State, Remilekun Fani-Kayode left Nigeria with his whole family and moved to the seaside resort town of Brighton in south eastern England.

25|$|After the {{marriage}} of Alfonso VI's heiress, Urraca, to the King of Aragon and Navarre, Alfonso the Battler, in 1110, Suero consistently supported the queen against her husband. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had confirmed Urraca's first act as successor of her husband Raymond in Galicia in December 1107. Only {{a day after the}} burial of Alfonso VI, on 22 July 1109, Suero was again one of those who confirmed Urraca's first act as successor. After the coronation of the queen's son by Raymond of Galicia, Alfonso VII, in September 1111, Suero, owing in part to his proximity to the Galician power base of Alfonso VII's backers, was the queen's most important supporter. By the fall of 1116 negotiations had begun between Urraca and Alfonso at Sahagún. According to the Historia compostellana, Suero and fellow Asturian Munio Peláez were the main defenders of the former, while the latter was supported by Diego Gelmírez, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, and Pedro Fróilaz de Traba. At Sahagún it was agreed to divide the realm into two spheres of authority, but these are not defined, although Galicia went undoubtedly to Alfonso VII. The accord was to last three years.|$|E

500|$|In 1957, {{administrative}} {{responsibility for the}} Commonwealth Observatory was transferred from the Australian Government's Department of the Interior to the Australian National University (ANU), a move supported by both its director, Richard Woolley, and Gascoigne. This was an era of significant change at Mount Stromlo: in January 1956 Woolley had resigned as director of Mount Stromlo {{to take up a}} position as Astronomer Royal and director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich. He was replaced by Bart Bok, whom Gascoigne liked and under whose directorship he played a significant role. Also in 1957, the Mount Stromlo team began searching for a new field observatory site, due to the increased light pollution from Canberra's growth. The search was vigorously promoted by Bok, and after an examination of 20 possible locations, two were shortlisted: Mount Bingar, near Griffith, New South Wales, and Siding Spring, near Coonabarabran, New South Wales. Gascoigne was {{one of a group of}} scientists who visited Siding Spring Mountain as part of the search, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who advocated this choice: ...|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested {{during the height of the}} ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E
500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> guys who could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E
