40|$|We {{describe}} the tadpoles of three species of Malagasy frogs, {{classified in the}} genus Spinomantis, based on specimens identified by DNA barcoding. The tadpole of Spinomantis aglavei is a typical Orton type IV larva. The oral disc is not <b>emarginated</b> laterally, but has two mid-ventral folds and a labial tooth row formula of 3 (2 - 3) / 2 (1). The tadpole of S. phantasticus is similar, the oral disc being laterally <b>emarginated</b> and having one medial fold; LTRF is 3 / 3 (1). A third species, S. cf. fimbriatus is also similar {{to the other two}} species; the oral disc is not laterally <b>emarginated</b> but has three medial folds and LTRF is 3 (2 - 3) / 3 (1). One shared character is a median fold or emargination in {{the lower part of the}} oral disc, although the shape of this fold is different in each of the three species. Only single specimens were available for examination in S. aglavei and S. phantasticus, preventing a further discussion of intraspecific morphological variation and of possibly diagnostic characters of larval morphology...|$|R
50|$|Aquila is a genus {{of large}} eagles that have long, rounded wings with deeply <b>emarginated</b> tips. They also {{have very strong}} legs and claws and ear-shaped nostrils. The {{subspecies}} A. a. fleayi is {{the largest of the}} wedge-tailed eagles.|$|R
25|$|The Norwegian Wasp {{is under}} the Vespidae family and the Dolichovespula genus. Based on recent studies on {{mitochondria}} genes, Dolichovespula and Vespula are monophyletic, meaning they descended from common ancestral group. Two species groups, maculata and norwegica form the Dolichovespula clade. While the maculata has physical attributes such as pronotal striae, <b>emarginate</b> apex of the seventh metasomal sternum in males, and aedeagal medial lobes, the D. norwegica females have long oculo-malar space and lateroanterior clypeal angles with less prominent semicircular projections.|$|E

The head is covered with small tubercles with poorly demarcated and indistinct margins, and the body with such tubercles arranged in 56 longitudinal rows on each side. The dorsal fin origin is nearer the tip of the snout than caudal flexure. The pectoral spine is stout, with or without serrations on the posterior edge.

25|$|These small catfish can be {{distinguished}} by their general colouring of yellow markings on a brown background. Fishes of the genus Akysis are diagnosed by having tough leathery skin covered with tubercles which are arranged in longitudinal rows along the sides, the anterior margin of the pectoral spine with a notch visible dorsally, the nasals with expansions beyond the canal-bearing teeth, and no palatal teeth. These fish are distinguished from {{the members of the}} genus Pseudobagarius by a number of characteristics: these species have a terminal mouth; the posterior and anterior nostrils being smaller and located further apart with a distance between the base of the nasal barbel and anterior nostril; the anterior nostrils are situated at the tip of a short tube; and the caudal fin is truncate or <b>emarginate</b> rathern that forked.|$|E

2500|$|V. rotundifolia is a {{sprawling}} shrub that can grow {{as tall as}} 1.5 m though it typically ranges from 0.5 to 1 m in height. As a product of its rapid nodal rooting, the plant can form dense mats reaching in excess of 10 m from the parent plant. New stems are green, square and fleshy initially before maturing brown and woody. Older, large-diameter stems are covered with heavily fissured bark. Running horizontal stems produce frequent upright branches. Leaves are strongly aromatic, intensifying when crushed. The majority of leaves are simple, but they can occasionally be palmate trifoliate or 2-leaved. Leaves measure 2 to 6.5cm in length and 1-4.5cm in width. Leaf margins are entire. The leaf shape varies from ovate to obovate with acute bases and obtuse apexes. Occasionally, leaf apexes are acute or <b>emarginate.</b> Upper leaf surfaces are dark green whereas lower leaf surfaces range in color from silver to white to light green; all leaf surfaces are tomentose. Petiole bases are typically somewhat purple and measure 0 to 1cm in length. Blades are cupped downward slightly. Leaf veins are lighter green than surrounding tissue. Flowers are borne in indeterminate panicles that may be terminal or axillary. Infloresences measure 3 to 7cm in length. The calyx is cup-shaped and 4 to 4.5cm long. Flowers are zygomorphic, purple to blue-purple, and short pedunculate. They are two-lipped and funnel-form (measuring 8mm in length). Four stamens are didynamous and extend beyond the corolla tube (measuring 9 to 10mm). The style extends beyond the stamens (total length: 12mm). Pollen is tricolpate. Ovaries consist of two carpels with each containing two single seeded locules. Fruits are globose drupes that are green while immature but turn yellow and red before maturing to bluish black. The fruits are frequently incorrectly characterized in the literature as [...] "seeds or berries". Each drupe contains a maximum of four seeds though there are usually fewer {{as a result of}} seed abortion. Each seed is encapsulated in a separate compartment. Endosperm is absent. Seeds germinate into tender seedlings that bear two cotyledons and quickly develop two red-margined true leaves. Ploidy level is 2n = 32, 34*.|$|E
