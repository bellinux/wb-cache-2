5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} advantage is important as when material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, {{there is no}} endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking, defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires.|$|E
5|$|In modern designs <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> use {{quartz crystal}} filters, {{especially}} for narrowband filtering applications. The signal exists as a mechanical acoustic wave {{while it is}} in the crystal and is converted by transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains at the terminals of the crystal.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce a}} wood sample {{to just the}} {{cellulose}} component before testing, but since this can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Residents of Sikkim are {{music lovers}} and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> hear Western rock music being played in homes and restaurants. Hindi pop songs are also common. Indigenous Nepali rock, music suffused with a western rock beat and Nepali lyrics, is {{particularly}} popular.|$|E
5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> use the term surface energy, which is a more general term {{in the sense that}} it applies also to solids.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} several power-associative binary {{operations}} defined on a set, any of which might be iterated, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> indicate which operation is being repeated by placing its symbol in the superscript. Thus, x∗n is , while x#n is , whatever the operations ∗ and # might be.|$|E

5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations {{are associated with the}} geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
5|$|Python's name {{is derived}} from the {{television}} series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> use Monty Python references in example code. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure Monty Python references.|$|E
50|$|In the 50s {{and early}} 60s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> {{have only a}} single hanging tom (a 13") and a single floor tom (16").|$|R

5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out delirium).|$|E
5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} color with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus. Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W-W ("Thalia"). In horticultural usage <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize {{belief in}} an afterlife, instead stressing {{the importance of}} behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels {{to the realm of}} the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E
50|$|The {{newspaper}} was an afternoon edition {{which focuses on}} the local happenings and was promoted as “The Paper That Cares”. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> find local community news making the headlines. The paper also had featured a “Page 3 Girl” and was not taken too seriously as it had {{the image of a}} tabloid with the printing of many unsubstantiated news articles. The newspaper had a commanding presence in classified ads and in the 1990s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> find almost half the newspapers comprising classified ads.|$|R

50|$|In larger Victorian houses <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> have {{accessible}} {{from the}} bedroom a boudoir for {{the lady of the}} house and a dressing room for the gentleman.|$|R
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>to</b> work 12 hours a day, {{six days a}} week in most factories; however long hours <b>were</b> also <b>common</b> outside factories.|$|R
