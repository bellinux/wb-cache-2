2500|$|In 1947, Harold Dahl {{claimed to}} have been warned not to talk about his alleged UFO {{sighting}} on Maury Island by a man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit.</b> In the mid 1950s, the ufologist Albert K. Bender claimed he was visited by men in dark suits who threatened and warned him not to continue investigating UFOs. [...] Another central figure in a UFO legend, Albert Bender supposedly was silenced by menacing men in black in 1953 because he had discovered the answer to the UFO mystery. Bender maintained that the men in black were secret government agents tasked with suppressing evidence of UFOs. The ufologist John Keel {{claimed to have}} had encounters with men in black and referred to them as [...] "demonic supernaturals" [...] with [...] "dark skin and/or “exotic” facial features". According to the ufologist Jerome Clark, reports of men in black represent [...] "experiences" [...] that [...] "don’t seem to have occurred in the world of consensus reality".|$|E
60|$|Somerset {{still looked}} towards the distant battlements. On the scaffolding, among the white-jacketed workmen, he could discern one figure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{little man}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> with a pale face, thin lips, and deep-set, black-encircled eyes, who was {{obviously}} in charge, {{came up with}} an anaemic smile.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} the ex-Mother Superior, who had already {{discarded}} the garb of the sisterhood, and was dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> walking <b>suit.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>an</b> {{effort to}} {{identify}} the robbers, the police resorted to the usual practice of interviewing potential witnesses to the crime. Fortunately {{there was no shortage}} of them, for many saw two men — one of them dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown <b>suit</b> and cap, the other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> blue serge <b>suit</b> and bowler hat — leave the paint shop at around 7:30 in the morning of 27 March. Two of these witnesses — a professional boxer named Henry John Littlefield and a local girl named Ellen Stanton — positively identified the one in the <b>dark</b> brown <b>suit</b> as Alfred Stratton.|$|R
60|$|She grasped tightly {{the rail}} around the seat, for the horses plunged down a sandy slope at a wild gallop, passing {{at the bottom}} a horse and buggy <b>in</b> which sat <b>a</b> man dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> gray <b>suit,</b> to whom Prescott waved his hand.|$|R
6000|$|MR MARCH'S {{voice is}} heard saying: [...] "Your friend in here." [...] He enters, [...] {{followed}} by a reluctant young man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> with dark hair and [...] a pale square face, enlivened by strange, very living, dark, bull's [...] eyes.|$|E
60|$|As she {{finished}} speaking {{they were both}} aware that a man had approached their table and stopped opposite them. Jimmy and the girl {{looked up to see}} a large man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> looking down at Eva. Jimmy did not recognize the man, but he knew at once what he was.|$|E
60|$|Whitey the Snowy Owl {{was sitting}} still {{to catch a}} dinner. I know that sounds queer, but it was so. He knew that {{so long as he}} sat still, he was not likely to be seen. It was for this purpose that Old Mother Nature had given him that coat of white. In the Far North, which was his real home, {{everything}} is white for months and months, and any one dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> can be seen a long distance. So Whitey had been given that white coat that he might have a better chance to catch food enough to keep him alive.|$|E
60|$|She {{left him}} alone for nearly ten minutes. She had {{scarcely}} {{left the room}} when another visitor entered. The Vicomte de Bergillac, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown <b>suit</b> and <b>an</b> apple-green tie, bowed to Duncombe, and carefully selected the most comfortable chair in his vicinity.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of <b>a</b> female diver <b>in</b> mid-air with <b>a</b> {{grandstand}} behind her, ca. 1930. Clad <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> bathing <b>suit</b> and light-colored swim cap, the diver takes a plunge. Her arms point {{straight in}} front of her toward the right, while her legs point into the air. Behind her sits a tall spectator stand. The background is neutral...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} {{of a man with}} thin lips and glasses, [s. d. ]. A man with rimless glasses, wrinkled eyes and a high forehead stares into the camera lens. He is clad <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> striped <b>suit,</b> <b>a</b> printed tie and light-colored undershirt. He has a large nose and parts his lips slightly as he poses for the picture...|$|R
60|$|The heath {{was covered}} with golden patches of {{flowering}} gorse, gleaming magnificently {{in the light of}} the bright spring sunshine. Behind one of these clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. It had been deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which I had come. He was clad <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> and I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the Charlington grounds, he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge, disappearing from my view.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood with}} her hand half raised. She {{had never seen the}} man before her. He was a tall, {{imposing}} gentleman, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit,</b> over which he wore a light-colored overcoat. One hand was gloved, and in the other he held a hat. His slightly curling brown beard and hair were trimmed after the fashion of the day, and his face, though darkened by the sun, showed no trace of toil, or storm, or anxious danger. He was a tall, broad-shouldered gentleman, with an air of courtesy, an air of dignity, an air of forbearance, which were as utterly unknown to her as everything else about him, except his eyes--those were the same eyes she had seen on board the Castor and on the desert sands.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a lady on horseback, {{accompanied}} by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> {{and covered with a}} thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Senator John Percival Jones, [s. d. ]. A {{man with a}} long beard and receding hairline stares sullenly into {{the left of the}} foreground. He is clad <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> three-piece <b>suit</b> with <b>a</b> black bow tie and light-colored undershirt. He arches thin eyebrows atop eyes set with bags, and a long pointed nose...|$|R
60|$|Matthew arrived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> serge <b>suit</b> and <b>a</b> blue necktie, so {{that the}} general effect was quiet. Ann greeted him with kindliness and put him with his face to what little light there was. She chose for herself the window-seat. Sylvia had not arrived. She {{might be a little}} late--that is, if she came at all.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of his}} life, Hades clothed himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{classical}} Greek toga {{and wore}} his black hair in ringlets. In recent years however, many of the gods adopted modern clothing <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to evolve with the times. Hades took to dressing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> black <b>suit</b> with top hat and cane, {{similar to that of}} a Victorian era Undertaker.|$|R
60|$|Poor Fanny! She sang little, {{and looked}} {{beautiful}} through that inappropriate hymn. Above her stood Harry--mercifully <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> and dark tie, looking almost handsome. And his lacerating, pure tenor sounded well, when {{the words were}} drowned in the general commotion. Brilliant she looked, and brilliant she felt, for she was hot and angrily miserable and inflamed {{with a sort of}} fatal despair. Because there was about him a physical attraction which she really hated, but which she could not escape from. He was the first man who had ever kissed her. And his kisses, even while she rebelled from them, had lived in her blood and sent roots down into her soul. After all this time she had come back to them. And her soul groaned, for she felt dragged down, dragged down to earth, as a bird which some dog has got down in the dust. She knew her life would be unhappy. She knew that what she was doing was fatal. Yet it was her doom. She had to come back to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{horse and}} trap {{were to have}} come this week, {{but for some reason}} they were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to the station. That was this morning. You can think that I looked out when I came to Charlington Heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he had been the two weeks before. He always kept so far from me that I could not clearly see his face, but it was {{certainly}} someone whom I did not know. He was dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> with a cloth cap. The only thing about his face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. To-day I was not alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my machine, but he slowed down his. Then I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then I laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of the road, and I pedalled very quickly round this, and then I stopped and waited. I expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. But he never appeared. Then I went back and looked round the corner. I could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. To make it the more extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{certainly}} do look like nice girls," [...] was Jack's mental comment; {{and he could}} not help but cast a second glance at the girl sitting directly next to him. She was attired <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> blue <b>suit</b> trimmed <b>in</b> fur and held a hat to match in her lap. Jack noted that she was fair of complexion, with dark, wavy hair.|$|R

His daughter offered a $100 reward {{for information leading to}} his discovery.|$|E
50|$|The stage show {{featured}} Elina Born {{dressed in}} a dark jumpsuit with a silver belt and Stig Rästa dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>suit</b> with casual shoes.

Born then finished the song on stage alone as Rästa exited during the final chorus.|$|E
60|$|The girl stopped, all <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tremble. <b>In</b> {{the shadow}} of the trees there was a camp-stool, and on the camp-stool sat a savage-looking man, dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> {{corduroy}} <b>suit,</b> with <b>a</b> blackened clay pipe stuck {{in the corner of his}} mouth. His weather-beaten mahogany face was plentifully covered with small-pox marks, and one of his eyes was sightless and white from the effects of the same disease. He rose now, and interposed himself between her and the gate.|$|R
50|$|The first {{policeman}} on {{the scene}} was handed a census form on which Kerr had written down Storie's gasped account of what she recalled at that moment; the document was never seen again.

He was dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown <b>suit</b> and <b>a</b> black hat. The round eyes of the dame de compagnie remained fixed on the two figures, which had resumed their leisurely approach.|$|R
