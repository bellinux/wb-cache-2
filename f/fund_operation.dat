500|$|Community Transit {{announced}} plans for a second Swift line in November 2013. The [...] line, tentatively named [...] "Swift II", was created out of two Transit Emphasis Corridors, and would travel from the Boeing Everett Factory to Mill Creek via Airport Road and State Route 527. A study, prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, and partially funded by the state legislature in 2012, estimated that the project would cost $42–48 million to construct, and attract 3,300 riders when it opened. The Federal Transit Administration approved project development in December 2014, a prerequisite to federal grants for capital construction and vehicle acquisition. During the 2015 session of the Washington State Legislature, Community Transit was granted the authority to increase sales taxes to <b>fund</b> <b>operation</b> of Swift II, pending voter approval via a ballot measure; the Washington State Department of Transportation also gave $6.8 million in funding to build the line's northern terminus at Seaway Transit Center.

5000|$|The {{concept and}} term [...] "prime brokerage" [...] is {{generally}} {{attributed to the}} U.S. broker-dealer Furman Selz in the late 1970s. However, the first hedge <b>fund</b> <b>operation</b> is attributed to Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949. In the pre-prime brokerage marketplace, portfolio management was a significant challenge; money managers had {{to keep track of}} all of their own trades, consolidate their positions and calculate their performance regardless of which brokerage firms executed those trades or maintained those positions. The concept was immediately seen to be successful, and was quickly copied by the dominant bulge bracket brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. At this nascent stage, hedge funds were much smaller than they are today and were mostly U.S. domestic long-short equities funds. The first non-U.S. prime brokerage business was created by Merrill Lynch's London office in the late 1980s. Post the 2007 - 09 financial crisis new entrants came to the market with custody-based prime brokerage offerings.|$|E

Among her employees was a woman named Irma Nici, who claims to have served Spitzer and English footballer David Beckham during her time in Davis' agency. Indeed, she stated on The Joy Behar Show that Spitzer was blacklisted from her agency for his violent behavior towards her staff. Another one of Davis's alleged clients was baseball player Alex Rodriguez, who is also rumored to have dated Davis herself; Davis has neither confirmed nor denied those allegations but has claimed to do business with Rodriguez. Davis's involvement with Spitzer, according to her, mostly took place during his time as Attorney General in 2005; for his part, Spitzer has denied ever using Davis's firm, and local police authorities have found no connection between Spitzer and Davis's firm.|$|E

Due to {{the implications of the}} choice of regulatory strategies and instruments in terms of mitigating systemic risk, the Article focuses on one critical aspect of hedge fund regulation, namely the choice between direct regulation and indirect regulation. This Article defines the distinction between direct and indirect regulation, maps this distinction’s implications in terms of regulatory techniques and instruments, and analyzes the arguments for and against direct and indirect regulation of hedge funds. This Article argues that the indirect regulation of hedge funds through their counterparties and creditors is not only less costly but also can better address regulatory arbitrage by hedge funds and their potential contribution to systemic risk. The economic and organizational structure of hedge funds and their particular features {{in terms of the number}} and composition of their counterparties and creditors support this policy recommendation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the Social Security OASDI Trust Fund is widely {{misunderstood}} by the public, thereby corrupting the debate {{on how to handle}} future scheduled benefits, and increasing the risk of program changes that would not be accepted if people understood how the program functions. The Trust Fund is a fiscal nullity but appears to be regarded by many as essential, hence the public debate is about how to "fix" it, rather than about the moral question of whether to fund scheduled benefits, which are clearly affordable. This misunderstanding indicates the need for a shift in emphasis in public descriptions of the program. For this, this paper lays out a set of data, arguments and analogies that are asserted to be accurate representations of the OASDI program and Trust <b>Fund</b> <b>operation,</b> and which are proposed as tools for public education. Finally, this paper argues that an important step in shifting public debate is to re-institute full recourse to Treasury funding for any payroll tax shortfall, which will force the public debate back to benefit levels and revenue sources. ...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the public}} pension system, both the Welfare Pension and the National Pension are {{administered}} in the pension and its related accounts {{in the welfare}} special accounting and the national special accounting respectively. However, the administration of those funds has not been separated from {{the execution of the}} annual budgets (including expenses for offices and operations) {{on the basis of the}} single year budgeting system. As a result, the independence necessary for long and middle term asset management of the pension funds lost. The problem arising there from are pointed out as follows: 1. No comparison of the accumulated pension accounts vs. future debt of the pension plan. 2. Mixture of the pension <b>fund</b> <b>operation</b> with the annual budgeting. 3. An unsettlement of the deficits of assumed interest income from the pension fund operations. 4. Irrational settlements between pension accounts and operating accounts. 5.
