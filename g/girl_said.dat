25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the <b>girl</b> <b>said,</b> and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E
500|$|One {{thousand}} young Asian professionals {{were surveyed}} on their {{opinions of the}} family, with most respondents saying the family were extremely unrealistic. One <b>girl</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think the Ferreiras are shit! The story lines are stupid, unrealistic and dull. Most Asians would not get evicted and then remain homeless, {{they would go to}} an aunty." [...] A female PR manager told the survey: [...] "Just how many shades of brown can there be in one family? You can't put them in any context. They have no background," [...] and another participant said, [...] "The Ferreiras should just be killed off. They are pointless, boring and the storylines are rubbish." [...] A barrister criticised the family's names, saying their first names were a mixture of Muslim and Hindu and their surname was Portuguese so the family should have been Catholic.|$|E
500|$|The Jonas Brothers {{characters}} were voiced by Parker and Stone, with Parker providing the voices for Kevin and Nick, and Stone voicing Joe, {{although the two}} switched characters on some lines. Parker also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse in [...] "The Ring". Parker and Stone were inspired to make the episode by the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience film, which was released the previous month. Because they were unfamiliar with the band, they spent {{a large amount of}} time watching Jonas Brothers concert clips online, which they found unoriginal and not very enjoyable. Parker said one of the Comedy Central employees told them that after she took her young daughter to see the concert film, the <b>girl</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mommy, my giney tickles". Parker thought the story was hilarious and worked the exact line into the episode.|$|E

500|$|Cy Grant, a Guyanese actor {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Lieutenant Green (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main computer operator and public announcer), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical calypsos on the current affairs programme Tonight. His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the <b>girl</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So I went out and auditioned and got the job." ...|$|E
500|$|Several people, telling amazing {{stories to}} those who would listen, passed {{themselves}} off as the [...] "sole survivor" [...] in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant <b>girl</b> <b>said</b> to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called [...] "Frankie Slide". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home. [...] Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling joist. Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. [...] The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995. In total, 23 people {{in the path of the}} slide survived, in addition to the 17 miners who escaped from the tunnels under Turtle Mountain.|$|E
500|$|The {{works of}} Gilbert and Sullivan are {{themselves}} frequently pastiched and parodied. Well known {{examples of this}} include Tom Lehrer's The Elements and Clementine; Allan Sherman's I'm Called Little Butterball, When I Was a Lad, You Need an Analyst and The Bronx Bird-Watcher; and The Two Ronnies' 1973 Christmas Special. Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as {{a key part of}} their routines, including Hinge and Bracket, Anna Russell, and the HMS Yakko episode of the animated TV series Animaniacs. Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades. Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film The <b>Girl</b> <b>Said</b> No. There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (2000) and The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, Knights of Song and a 1975 West End show called Tarantara!

2500|$|A great battle raged {{around the}} dead Achilles. Ajax held back the Trojans, while Odysseus carried the body away. When Achilles' armour was {{offered to the}} smartest warrior, the two that had saved his body came forward as competitors. Agamemnon, unwilling to {{undertake}} the invidious duty of deciding between the two competitors, referred the dispute to {{the decision of the}} Trojan prisoners, inquiring of them which of the two heroes had done most harm to the Trojans. Alternatively, the Trojans and Pallas Athena were the judges in that, following Nestor's advice, spies were sent to the walls to overhear what was said. A <b>girl</b> <b>said</b> that Ajax was braver: ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s Dewey's {{successful}} efforts against organized crime—and especially his conviction of Lucky Luciano—had {{turned him into}} a national celebrity. His nickname, the [...] "Gangbuster", was used for the popular 1930s Gang Busters radio series based on his fight against the mob. Hollywood film studios made several movies inspired by his exploits; Marked Woman starred Humphrey Bogart as a Dewey-like DA and Bette Davis as a [...] "party girl" [...] whose testimony helps convict the gang boss. A popular story from the time, possibly apocryphal, featured a young girl who told her father that she wanted to sue God to stop a prolonged spell of rain.
