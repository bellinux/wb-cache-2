5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E
25|$|Both survived, {{although}} Willoughby {{lost one}} of <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head wound. She was not charged since investigators believed she had been acting in self-defense; {{he was charged with}} assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a female and discharging a firearm in an occupied dwelling. After being released from the hospital, he was taken to Moore County jail and held on $1 million bail.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
60|$|She {{found she}} was {{trembling}} at his nearness {{and full of}} a thrilling dread that he might touch her. She pulled herself together and put <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eye-piece.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm coming in," [...] Elsbeth murmured with <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> telescope. [...] "Cassiopeia," [...] she murmured. [...] "Where are you all?" [...] she asked, taking <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{away from}} the telescope. [...] "How dark it is!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{face of the}} Marshal as {{a frightened}} child might look towards its mother.|$|R
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
2500|$|After graduating with {{first-class}} honours {{in geography}} from Birmingham University in 1998, Wellington travelled {{the world for}} two years, which she described as opening <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "many problems {{that exist in the}} world, but also to the opportunity for positive change." [...] In 2000, supported by a £10,000 scholarship from the Economic and Social Research Council, she enrolled in an MA course in development studies at the University of Manchester. Graduating with a Distinction in October 2001, she joined the UK government agency DEFRA in London to work on international development policy. At DEFRA, she was part of the team that negotiated for the UK at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and became involved in following up the UK government's commitments on water and sanitation. She also worked on post-conflict environmental reconstruction policy.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. She stares at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent that the ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty-five," [...] said lovely Fatima, casting <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. [...] "Heigh-ho! but Romane danced {{them very}} well!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> flitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{pavilion}} {{and back}} to me. We stood close together, extraordinarily intimate, and extraordinarily apart.|$|R
60|$|And <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> wandered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> green tree-tops tossing in the wind, whose shadows flickered pleasantly {{above the}} child.|$|R
60|$|Miss Trotter raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speaker {{with a half}} {{critical}} impatience.|$|E
60|$|She laughed gently, {{and raised}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> green {{roof of the}} needles.|$|E
60|$|She shot one wary {{glance at}} him and then turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
60|$|She glided round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, {{took the}} head of the bolt between her finger and thumb, and softly screwed it round until it was entirely {{withdrawn}} from its position. The shutters remained as before, whilst, where the bolt had come out, was now a shining hole three-quarters of an inch in diameter, through which one might see {{into the middle of the}} room. She applied <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orifice.|$|R
60|$|So she loitered unwillingly at {{her window}} {{high over the}} grey, hard, cobbled street, and saw her landlady hastening along the black asphalt pavement, her dirty apron thrown discreetly over what was most {{obviously}} a quart jug. She followed the squat, intent figure with <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public-house at the corner. And then she saw Ciccio humped over his yellow bicycle, going for a steep and perilous ride with Gigi.|$|R
60|$|And, indeed, {{conscious}} {{that she had}} done all that was incumbent upon her, and fearful lest the chill which she felt creeping over her own heart should infect others, Eveline took her vassal's advice, and withdrew slowly to her own apartment, often casting back <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place where the Welsh, now drawn out and under arms, were advancing their ridgy battalions, like the waves of an approaching tide.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear, dear!' ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen ceiling: 'this {{comes of}} being liberal!' ...|$|E
60|$|As a rule, Mrs. Mallowe {{does not}} approve of staring, but on this {{occasion}} she opened <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> utmost.|$|E
60|$|She lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{and folded}} her hands. She was by now quite {{composed}} again, her habitual sorrowful self.|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia made no reply, {{but looked}} distressed, and dropped <b>her</b> mild <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carpet; Miss Plowden {{took it upon}} herself to answer: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{should like}} it so much," [...] said Kathleen, {{clasping}} her little hands and raising <b>her</b> large <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> captain's face.|$|R
6000|$|Eve's heart throbbed, while <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> sunk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carpet. The others seemed amazed, {{and after}} a brief pause, Mr. Sharp observed-- ...|$|R
60|$|The landlady raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ceiling with}} {{the air of a}} person who had {{deserved}} martyrdom, and who submitted to it cheerfully.|$|E
60|$|Lady Ferringhall lifted <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newcomer, and the {{greeting}} in them was obviously meant for him alone. She continued to fan herself.|$|E
60|$|Mercy {{returned}} to the couch. She could stand no longer; she had not even resolution enough left to lift <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Matthew Moon," [...] murmured Bathsheba, turning <b>her</b> bright <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book. [...] "Ten and twopence halfpenny {{is the sum}} {{put down}} to you, I see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{loves me}}, loves me not,' she cries; 'He loves {{me more than}} earth or heaven!' And then glad tears have filled <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>To</b> find <b>the</b> number was uneven.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated, stopped, thumped {{the stock}} of his gun on the ground, and wheeled. He looked at her doubtingly, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
60|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man in {{the bunk}} as if to reassure herself of his identity, and then in silence {{returned}} Linday's gaze.|$|E
6000|$|She turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} {{shining in}} the morning light. [...] "I'm glad it has happened in a beautiful place. It might have been--anywhere." ...|$|E
60|$|As he said, {{she looked}} strange. She turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door {{by which they}} had entered and raised her fan as if in warning.|$|E
60|$|Miss Keene raised <b>her</b> clear <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ecclesiastic. That {{accomplished}} diplomat of Todos Santos absolutely felt confused {{under the}} cool scrutiny of this girl's unbiased and unsophisticated intelligence.|$|R
60|$|She {{resigned}} herself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> erratic {{movements of}} the son, who, being again, in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> heir <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peerage, was <b>to</b> her like a comet in a higher sphere.|$|R
25|$|<b>Her</b> debut album, <b>Eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Telescope, was {{released}} in late 2004.|$|R
