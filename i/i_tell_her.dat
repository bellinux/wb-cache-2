It's terrible. Every time I come back after being {{away from home for}} a night she won't let me {{be in the same room}} with her if she can help it. Stasz writes that these were [...] "code words for [...] fear that [...] was consorting with prostitutes and might bring home venereal disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
6000|$|Toff {{lifted his}} {{indicative}} forefinger {{to the side}} of his nose. [...] "Suppose <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something else, sir? Suppose <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> my master {{is not going to be}} married to anybody?" ...|$|E
60|$|ENGLAND. She's got talent, as <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'er.</b> But she ain't you, dear. It's no good {{saying she}} is.|$|R
60|$|So, {{to cheer}} <b>her</b> up, <b>I</b> <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> about the {{piece in the}} paper I showed him; but it didn't seem to cheer her up any. And she goes out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> met you, {{and that}} you are well, and, if Philip will allow me, <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> more; but of course I don't know if he will or not. What ring is that you wear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty well;--not {{as it used}} to be, you know, miss. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{she ought}} to go somewheres,--but she don't like moving nohow. She never did. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> if she'd go to Dawlish,--just for a week. But she don't think there's a bed fit to sleep on, nowhere, except just her own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no--not then. When <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{everything}} I {{speak in}} another way, {{in a low}} voice--not {{on my knees and}} praying. At night, and in the woods, and when I am alone <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> But perhaps she does not hear me; she is not here, but up there--so far! She never answers, but when I speak to my people they will answer me." ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. Infamous wretch! (Aside.) Shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> he is dead? No; she {{is still}} too feeble.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} Sylvie says," [...] Bruno rejoined. [...] "She says I wo'n't learn my lessons. And <b>I</b> <b>tells</b> <b>her,</b> over and over, I ca'n't learn 'em. And what doos oo think she says? She says 'It isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''E's got th' monkey on 'is back ower {{this letter}} job,' said the father {{secretly}} to me. 'Mother, 'er knows nowt about it. Lot o' tom-foolery, isn't it? Ay! What's good o' makkin' a peck o' trouble over what's far enough off, an' ned niver come no nigher. No--not a smite o' use. That's what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'er.</b> 'Er should ta'e no notice on't. Ty, what can y' expect.' ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I don't think she's {{playing the}} game, and <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Clemens dreads our {{going to}} New Orleans, but <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she'll {{have to give}} her consent this time.|$|E
60|$|Could <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> Could I {{confess to}} the gloomy presentiment that overshadowed me? Could I make myself intelligible to her? No.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it, either, and I expect aunt Dorcas {{will think}} I'm a terrible bad feller, when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the story." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 46 Therefore, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you, <b>her</b> many sins {{have been}} forgivenâ€”for she loved much.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that {{you have not been}} blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that you shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|R
60|$|Wood. [Aside.] But such {{a terrible}} wasp, as she, will spoil the snare, if <b>I</b> durst <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please, ma'am, should <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} is not a school manager?' inquired the mistress, {{somewhat}} indignantly, when the two ladies had departed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> I didn't reproach you {{and never}} thought of such a thing. And I said I would break open my letter and say so.|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that you}} forgive her?" [...] the Vicar asked, {{as they were}} walking {{together}} {{up and down the}} station in the Waterloo Road.|$|E
6000|$|... "She had {{reasons for}} believing {{that there was}} a young sister living, and her {{greatest}} desire was, to help that sister. <b>I</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that <b>I</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She oughtn't to have come. <b>I</b> should <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> just that. You {{might send}} the maid to <b>her</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that you couldn't see her again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I {{come on the}} {{previous}} day, and had I been able then to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> all that <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> now, would it have made no difference?" ...|$|R
60|$|Margaret and I are {{agreed that}} sulphur, {{excessively}} inhaled, leaves the lungs sore. Only now, after a lapse {{of a dozen}} hours, can we draw breath in anything that resembles comfort. But still my lungs were not so sore as to prevent my telling her what I had learned she meant to me. And yet she is only a woman--I tell her so; <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that {{there are at least}} seven hundred and fifty millions of two-legged, long-haired, gentle-voiced, soft-bodied, female humans like her on the planet, and that she is really swamped by the immensity of numbers of her sex and kind. But <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something more. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that of all of them she is the only one. And, better yet, to myself and for myself, I believe it. I know it. The last least part of me and all of me proclaims it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, Jeanne. But {{mother will}} look upon you as her {{daughter}} directly <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that you have}} promised to become so in reality some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See her way!" [...] exclaimed McKay {{with some}} asperity: [...] "she will hev {{to see her}} way when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to open her eyes an' look!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he said, {{with his}} eyes fixed on mine, and his hand still on my arm. [...] "If <b>I</b> don't <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> nobody shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You!" [...] said MacIan, {{with a sort}} of {{sincere and}} instinctive astonishment. [...] "Why should you--no, <b>I</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> of course----" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. You are right. What could I know of such things? Don't let us talk {{any more}} about it--as for telling my {{daughter}} who I am, that I do not allow. It is my secret, it is not yours. If I {{make up my mind}} to <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>I</b> think I will, <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> before <b>I</b> leave the house--if not, <b>I</b> shall never <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is to be}} done now?" [...] {{asked the}} husband. [...] "What shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> How shall I make her understand? What can I do for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> all?" [...] demanded Caroline of her mother. Leave being {{signified}} by a gesture, Shirley was presently enlightened {{on what had}} happened in her absence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say?" [...] {{said the}} older girl, [...] "I {{want to speak}} to you. I think it's a down shame, the way that you've been treated; and Statira, she feels jus' 's I do about it; and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she's got to say so. It's the least she can do, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> after what she got you in for. My name's 'Manda Grier; I room 'th S'tira; 'n' I come 'th her this mornin' t' help keep her up; b't I didn't know 't was goin' to be s'ch a perfect flat-out!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> did <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{all that}} had happened, {{speaking}} as mildly as I could of Mr. Enderton's conduct. Poor Ruth burst into tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell her! How am <b>I</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{when she}} couldn't {{so much as}} hear a pistol in her ears? Try and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> yourself, {{if you have a}} mind to." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{was again}} a fair degree of {{interest}} in moving to rural land after World War II. In 1947, Betty MacDonald published what became a popular book, The Egg and <b>I,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> story of marrying and then moving to a small farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. This story was {{the basis of a}} successful comedy film starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray.|$|R
