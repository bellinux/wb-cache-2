5|$|Charlton {{lost the}} 1925 election, {{largely due to}} <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> on {{industrial}} relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor James Scullin {{went on to become}} the Prime Minister of Australia, something Charlton never managed to do.|$|E

5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, 20 Tea Party organizations, {{about half}} of the roughly 40 Tea Party groups in Tennessee, {{endorsed}} Ramsey for governor because of <b>his</b> <b>stances</b> on state sovereignty, health care, immigration and fiscal issues.|$|R
50|$|During the Prague Spring of 1968, Przeczek {{supported}} the reformist {{wing of the}} Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. <b>His</b> <b>stances</b> led to ban of his works from 1969 to 1989 in Czechoslovakia. His books were therefore published mainly in Poland.|$|R

5|$|Osbert {{was opposed}} to the {{election}} of William fitzHerbert as Archbishop of York and supported William's rival and successor Henry Murdac. Although he remained a supporter of Murdac after 1147, he did oppose Murdac's interventions in Selby Abbey, where Murdac had deposed one abbot and appointed another. In 1153, Osbert deposed Murdac's choice as abbot of Selby and appointed another abbot. Originally, Osbert had supported Elias Paynel, Murdac's choice for abbot, but then changed <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> and helped with the deposition.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the direct election of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, {{and the creation of a}} public utilities commission. McCreary also changed <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
5|$|The work {{purchased}} by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. <b>His</b> <b>stance</b> is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Muskie {{was one of}} {{the first}} environmentalists to enter the Senate, and was a leading campaigner for new and {{stronger}} measures to curb pollution and provide a cleaner environment. <b>His</b> <b>stances</b> on the environment had him labeled as [...] "Mr. Clean." ...|$|R

50|$|James voted {{consistently}} {{with the}} radicals until 1825, {{when he began}} to moderate <b>his</b> <b>stances.</b> The following year with falling returns from his Jamaican estates, James decided not to defend his seat at the 1826 general election. He was nonetheless nominated, but did not attend, and finished in a poor third place.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Evans and Brooks were raucously received in their hometown of Perth. They were denied a civic reception by the Lord Mayor of Perth, Fred Chaney, because of <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> on Afghanistan, but the Mayor of Fremantle, Bill McKenzie, hosted one instead. Evans also received congratulations from Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. After being greeted as a hero, Brooks considered retiring {{as he felt}} that his gold had diminished his hunger for further success.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed <b>his</b> <b>stance.</b> He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

5000|$|Some of Kerry's {{popular support}} came from [...] "Anybody but Bush" [...] voters - {{those who voted}} {{for him as a}} {{repudiation}} of the Bush administration's policies. One of the major focuses of his campaign was to attract voters to <b>his</b> <b>stances</b> on the issues, instead of as a de facto opponent of the President.|$|R
5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. <b>His</b> <b>stance</b> in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened <b>his</b> <b>stance</b> on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knoxâ€“Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E
