40|$|Abstract. The <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{technical}} device used for regulating a fluid or a <b>gas</b> flow. <b>Throttle</b> <b>valve</b> {{control is a}} challenging task, due to its complex dynamics and demanding constraints for the controller. Using state-of-the-art <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control, such as model-free PID controllers, time-consuming and manual adjusting of the controller is necessary. In this paper, we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can help to alleviate the effort of manual controller design by automatically learning a control policy from experiences. In order to obtain a valid control policy for the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve,</b> several constraints need to be addressed, such as no-overshoot. Furthermore, the learned controller {{must be able to}} follow given desired trajectories, while moving the valve from any start to any goal position and, thus, multi-targets policy learning needs to be considered for RL. In this study, we employ a policy search RL approach, Pilco [2], to learn a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control policy. We adapt the Pilco algorithm, while taking into account the practical requirements and constraints for the controller. For evaluation, we employ the resulting algorithm to solve several control tasks in simulation, as well as on a physical <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system. The results show that policy search RL is able to learn a consistent control policy for complex, real-world systems. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{electronic}} <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> systems has been very popular in the automotive industry. It is used to regulate the amount of air flow into the engine. Due {{to the existence of}} multiple nonsmooth nonlinearities, the controller design to the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> becomes difficult task. These nonlinearities including stick–slip friction, backlash, and a discontinuous nonlinear spring involved in the system. In {{the first part of this}} paper the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system is presented first, and then the model is derived for each components of the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system. Later, the system dimension is reduced to two by ignoring the motor inductance at the end of this part of work. Actually this step enables us to design a nonlinear PID controller electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system. The simulation results, of applying a nonlinear PID controller to the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system, show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in forcing the angle of the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> to the desired opening angle in presence of nonlinearities and disturbances in <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system model...|$|R

50|$|There is no {{mechanical}} linkage between the accelerator pedal and the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> with electronic <b>throttle</b> control. Instead, {{the position of}} the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> (i.e., the amount of air in the engine) is fully controlled by the ETC software via the electric motor. But just opening or closing the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> by sending a new signal to the electric motor is an open loop condition and leads to inaccurate control. Thus, most if not all current ETC systems use closed loop feedback systems, such as PID control, whereby the ECU tells the throttle to open or close a certain amount. The throttle position sensor(s) are continually read and then the software makes appropriate adjustments to reach the desired amount of engine power.|$|R
