5|$|Carbonic acid equilibria are {{important}} for acid–base <b>homeostasis</b> in the human body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homeostasis</b> is {{the ability}} of an open system to {{regulate}} its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autonomic {{functions}} of the brain include the regulation, or rhythmic control of the heart rate and rate of breathing, and maintaining <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining <b>homeostasis,</b> helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base <b>homeostasis</b> by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid hormone (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of calcium and {{phosphate}} <b>homeostasis,</b> as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} of free calcium {{in the cell}} can regulate an array of reactions and is important for signal transduction in the cell. Mitochondria can transiently store calcium, a contributing process for the cell's <b>homeostasis</b> of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and <b>homeostasis.</b> The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Potassium <b>homeostasis</b> {{denotes the}} {{maintenance}} of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments.|$|E
5|$|Surfactant <b>homeostasis</b> is {{critical}} for breathing (and thus survival) in the prematurely born infant, but also for maintaining lung health, and normal lung function throughout life. Changes in the amount or composition of surfactant can alter its function and are associated with respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|A {{primitive}} nervous system, without centralization, coordinates {{the processes}} involved in maintaining <b>homeostasis,</b> as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis {{and one in the}} gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the septa with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol <b>homeostasis.</b> After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould {{published}} a landmark paper developing their theory {{and called it}} punctuated equilibria. Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr's model of geographic speciation, I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic <b>homeostasis,</b> and their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed {{that the degree of}} gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant huntingtin protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein <b>homeostasis</b> and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} <b>homeostasis,</b> any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and <b>homeostasis.</b> The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion <b>homeostasis,</b> induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeostasis</b> {{modulation}} (e.g., water balance).|$|E
25|$|Blood {{pressure}} and fluid and electrolyte <b>homeostasis</b> is {{regulated by the}} renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system.|$|E
25|$|The ependymal {{cells and}} the SCO–spondin {{secretion}} {{are thought to}} play a role in <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Holism {{assumes that}} health is {{affected}} by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or existential dimension. In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, vertebral subluxation. <b>Homeostasis</b> emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of innate intelligence {{can be thought of}} as a metaphor for <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neurosecretory {{cells in}} the brain can produce one or more hormones that affect growth, reproduction, <b>homeostasis</b> and metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|Acid–base equilibria are {{important}} in a very wide range of applications, such as acid–base <b>homeostasis,</b> ocean acidification, pharmacology and analytical chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{timing is}} {{controlled}} by the circadian clock (Process C), sleep-wake <b>homeostasis</b> (Process S), and to some extent by individual will.|$|E
25|$|Hunger is a {{sensation}} that {{is governed by}} a set of brain structures (e.g., the hypothalamus) that are responsible for energy <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} toxicity of copper {{has not been}} well studied in humans, but it is infrequent in normal populations {{that do not have}} a hereditary defect in copper <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2011, it was {{demonstrated}} that the methylation of mRNA plays {{a critical role in}} human energy <b>homeostasis.</b> The obesity-associated FTO gene is shown to be able to demethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} glucose from metabolic precursors. The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in glucose <b>homeostasis,</b> over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far {{the most common form of}} diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood glucose <b>homeostasis,</b> a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} about how {{and to what extent}} {{different}} dietary factors— such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals—contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain <b>homeostasis,</b> the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the body's ability to maintain <b>homeostasis</b> and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).|$|E
25|$|The BMPs bind to {{the bone}} {{morphogenetic}} protein receptor type-2 (BMPR2). They {{are involved in a}} multitude of cellular functions including osteogenesis, cell differentiation, anterior/posterior axis specification, growth, and <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} {{to this idea}} {{is the one that}} fatigue is due to peripheral ‘limitation’ or ‘catastrophe’. In this view, regulation by fatigue occurs as a consequence of a failure of <b>homeostasis</b> directly in muscles.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{are also}} shown {{to play a}} role in the {{development}} and <b>homeostasis</b> of T lymphocytes. This has been shown in transgenic mice with either increased or decreased sensitivity of T cell lineage to glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also known}} that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin {{diseases}} and skin <b>homeostasis.</b> There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has suggested {{a role for}} retinoids in cutaneous adverse effects {{for a variety of}} drugs including the antimalarial drug proguanil. It is proposed that drugs such as proguanil act to disrupt retinoid <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The kidneys {{regulate}} the serum magnesium. About 2400mg of magnesium {{passes through the}} kidneys daily, of which 5% (120mg) is excreted through urine. The loop of Henle is the major site for magnesium <b>homeostasis,</b> and 60% is reabsorbed.|$|E
25|$|Bone tissue {{undergoes}} constant remodeling and is kept {{in balance}} (<b>homeostasis)</b> by osteoblasts creating bone and osteoclasts destroying bone. Bisphosphonates inhibit the digestion of bone by encouraging osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis, or cell death, thereby slowing bone loss.|$|E
