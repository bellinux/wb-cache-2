5|$|Thompson and Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho.

500|$|Field {{characteristics}} {{that help to}} distinguish Mycena purpureofusca from similar species include the dark purple gill edges, the deep purple cap center, and its cartilagineous consistency. M.californiensis (formerly M.elegantula) is similar, but has gill edges colored rosy to vinaceous-brown, and its cap is browner than that of M.purpureofusca. It has an orange to orange-brown cap, a stipe the exudes red juice when injured, and grows in lead litter under oaks. Mitchel and Smith noted that there was considerable <b>intergradation</b> between the two species. The bioluminescent fungus M.lux-coeli is another allied species, but it has smaller spores (8.5–12 by 6.5–9µm) and its cystidia are more lobed.

5000|$|The genus Parochetus was {{established}} by David Don (based on unpublished manuscripts by Francis Hamilton) in Hamilton's [...] ("Introduction to the Flora of Nepal") of 1825 for the two species P. communis and P. major, which were separated {{on the basis of}} their leaf margins. In 1835, John Forbes Royle described a third species, P. oxalidifolia, again based on leaf margin differences. It was later realised that <b>intergradations</b> between all three leaf forms were seen, and so the three taxa were merged into a single species. In 1871, Parochetus was collected from Africa for the first time, as part of David Livingstone's Zambezi Expedition, from Mount Chiradzulu in southern Malawi. A new species, Parochetus africanus, was erected for specimens from Africa in 1991 by Roger Marcus Polhill, but this was reduced to a subspecies of P. communis in 1998 because of a perceived lack of differentiating characters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} in identifying separate subspecies, or even species, is pronounced. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper reported some specimens of capuchin from the Barranquilla animal market had supposedly {{come from the}} middle valley of the San Jorge River. It {{is difficult to determine}} whether these are white-headed capuchins (Cebus capucinus) or white-fronted capuchins. Intermediate characteristics include a dark crown that is high and removed from the forehead. The white parts on the face are more distinctively bald and the outside parts of the arms and legs are more clear; this suggests they are white-headed capuchin. Some specimens of C. a. versicolor seen in the market at Magangué‚ and probably captured in the lower Cauca River, show similar tendencies to the above, except that there is no increase in the dark pigmentation. Based on these observations and on various [...] "intermediate" [...] specimens from northern Colombia, it seems possible that an investigation of the contact zone between the white-headed capuchin and white-fronted capuchin ultimately could show that these forms are conspecific. Another critical zone for this analysis is an area in northeast Ecuador where C. a. aecuatoriales and white-headed capuchin are found, although neither sympatric distributions or <b>intergradation</b> have as yet been determined.|$|E

Nearly all queens mated although few workers did so in rooms with a few males, but mating had no effect on subsequent behavior or ovarian development. In groups of diverse age there was a tendency for the oldest bees to be queens; queens also were larger on the average than workers. In groups of equal age, the largest bee was most often queen. As would be expected for a scarcely social species, mechanisms of social integration (resulting in division of labor and differentiation of castes) mostly appear to involve behavioral features of the solitary ancestors and accidental results of joint occupancy of nests.

5000|$|B. b. yenisseensis (Buturlin, 1911)- Known as {{the eastern}} Siberian eagle-owl. This race {{is found in}} central Siberia from about the Ob eastward to Lake Baikal, north to about latitudes 580 to 590 N on the Yenisei River, south to the Altai, Tarbagatai and the Saur Mountain ranges and in Tannu Tuva and Khangai Mountains in northwestern Mongolia, grading into B. b. sibiricus near Tomsk {{in the west and}} into B. b. ussuriensis in the east of {{northern}} Mongolia.

40|$|Ever {{since it}} became {{apparent}} that terrestrial animals ranging over large continental areas generally showed a certain degree of gradual geographic variation, attention has been focused on the colour variation of the Jay, Garrulus glandarius, in Europe. Surely the Jays belong to those species of palearctic land birds in which the formation of geographical differences must be considered to be exceptionally favoured: HARTERT (1903 — 1922; including HARTERT & STEINBACHER 1932) recognized as many as 10 European races of the Jay by name, whereas Kleiner (1935 — 38) in his monographic treatment of the species numbered as many as 9 races in the same region. In several instances of the geographic variation of the Jay the differences are exceedingly striking, e. g. between the reddish brown Jays from Ireland and the dark grey ones from northern and central Europe. Still, the <b>intergradations</b> are so gradual and the individual variation is so unexpectedly large, that the application of subspecific names as a method of expressing geographical variation has proved to meet with serious difficulties. The resulting confusion of names for years has stressed geographical differences being of only minor importance and has obscured others meriting a closer attention. However, it was not at all for nomenclatorial purposes that this study was started, nor in order to propose a new arrangement of the geographic races of the Jay in Europa. That, in spite of this, these topics have been dealt with in one of the following chapters of this paper must be explained {{from the fact that the}} author failed to see a possibility to avoid them. The main purpose of this study was to investigate instances of “clinal variation”, meaning the presence and the origin of geographical character gradients. “Character gradients in the frequencies or in the expression of variable characters” (DOBZHANSKY 1947, p. 67) occurring in continuous geographical areas have seriously attracted the attention of students of population genetics and of micro-evolution. Hence it seemed worth while to select a suitable subject for a comparison of local individual variation with geographical variation and to study the origin of the clines. This is what the author has tried to do in the course of the present study on Garrulus glandarius...|$|R

40|$|Zawar, {{the only}} lead-zinc {{producing}} mine in India, I {{located in the}} lowest part of the upper Aravalli, ascrbed to the Archaen system. The rock types exposed {{in the area are}} dolomites, quartzites, phyllites and schists, which have suffered lo-grade regional metamorphim and which display high dip (60 º - 80 º). Chemical, optical and X-ray investigations were carried out on biotites. Optical determinations suggest that the biotites belong to meroxene and lepidomelane varieties, while the X-ray analysis indicate that they are in 1 M [or 3 T?] polymorphic state. <b>Intergradations</b> among the different rock types are very common. Petrographic studies reveal to sets of deformations (pre-crystalline and post-crystalline). Mineralisation is found only in dolomite; although there is no consistent structural control of mineralisation, there is an obvious control by lithology. No wall-rock alteration exclusively due to mineralisation has been observed; the presence of any associated minerals can be accounted for as derived from the host rocks during regional metamorphism. Although the main ore deposit follows the E-W trend, for most of the area, the regional trend is N-S. This structural anomaly is explained by cross-folding resulting from pressures acting at right angles to the main Aravalli forces. Cross-folding appears to have been accompanied by a local rise in temperature leading to recrystallization and remobilization of minerals. Recrystallization in ore texture is well-evidenced by the triple junctions at 120 in a single phase aphalerite matrix; galena also shows similar feature. In mochia-Balaria area these recrystallization of sulphides in cracked crystals of microcline are seen. Banding of galena and sphalerite, is interpreted as due to deformation of mixed soft and hard sulphites. It is, therefore, concluded that mineralisation pre-dated the metamorphism. Hence, no meaningful paragenetic sequence can be discerned among the sulphides. From the X-ray fabric analysis of ores and rocks, some support comes for a pre-metamorphic emplacement of the mineralization. Ore minerals and host rocks both reveal preffered orientation. Probably the ore was in place even before the first metamorphic episode. Where it is localized in shear planes and tensional openings, metamorphism is considered to have caused it to migrate to sites of lower pressure. Geochemical analysis of trace elements near the ore body suggests a progressive enrichment in chalcophile elements and a corresponding impoverishment in lithoplhile elements as the sulphate mineralization increases. High Sr- and Rb- contents accompany Pb-high and Zn-poor zones. The dispersion patterns of trace elements indicate a wall-rock aureole of approximately 20 ft. in doloriite. As alternatives to primary wall-rock alteration two possibilities are considered: (1) primary dispersion in sediments (2) secondary dispersion through pore fluids during metamorphisas. The 'secondary' porosity-permeability values show an increase with depth, may prehaps be correlated with increasing grain size and dolomitization; these are the result of post-mineralization iiietamorphism and movement. The deposit, is interpreted as a tectonically metamorphosed, reraobilized ore, where a syngenetic submarine hydrothermal origin for the galena, blende and pyrite seems to fit the facts of Mineralogy and geochemistry best, although the possibility of a pre-metamorphic epigenetic origin can not be completely ignored...|$|R
