25|$|Natural gas is {{dehydrated}} by {{ethylene glycol}}. In this application, ethylene glycol flows {{down from the}} top of a tower and meets a rising mixture of water vapor and hydrocarbon gases. Dry gas exits {{from the top of the}} tower. The glycol and water are separated, and the glycol recycled. Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (triethylene glycol) is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a glycol dehydration tower.|$|E

2500|$|The {{measurements}} {{above are}} not fixed {{for a given}} storage facility. For example, deliverability depends on several factors including the amount of gas in the reservoir and the pressure etc. Generally, a storage facility’s deliverability rate varies directly with {{the total amount of}} gas in the reservoir. It is at its highest when the reservoir is full and declines as gas is withdrawn. The injection capacity of a storage facility is also variable and depends on factors similar to those that affect deliverability. The <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> varies inversely with the total amount of gas in storage. It is at its highest when the reservoir is nearly empty and declines as more gas is injected. The storage facility operator may also change operational parameters. [...] This would allow, for example, the storage capacity maximum to be increased, the withdrawal of base gas during very high demand or reclassifying base gas to working gas if technological advances or engineering procedures allow.|$|E

It involves the injection of stabilizing materials into liquefiable saturated sand. In this study, a pilot-scale facility (243 cm by 366 cm in plan× 122 cm deep) was used to inject a dilute colloidal silica stabilizer into liquefiable sand specimens. The grout advancement was monitored in real time using electrical conductivity cells embedded in the specimens. <b>Injection</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 65 to 9000 ml/min/well were used to investigate the optimal rate of grout delivery. In tests with low <b>injection</b> <b>rates,</b> the delivery performance was low due to sinking, while at higher <b>injection</b> <b>rates,</b> sinking was less noticeable. After the treatment, the degree of grout penetration was evaluated by excavating the model. The in situ unconfined compressive strength was measured using a pocket penetrometer, and soil blocks were excavated for additional unconfined compressive testing. Moreover, the 3 -D flood simulator, UTCHEM, was utilized to simulate the experimental results and to predict the <b>injection</b> <b>rates</b> for adequate stabilizer delivery. The results of the strength testing demonstrated that as little as 1 % by weight of the colloidal silica provides a significant improvement in strength after a month of curing.

40|$|Fractured {{reservoirs}} {{have always}} been considered poor candidates for enhanced oil recovery. This {{can be attributed to}} the complexities involved in understanding and predicting performance in these reservoirs. In a fractured system, the high permeability fracture forms the preferred pathway for the injected fluids, and a large amount of oil that is stored in the matrix is bypassed. Hence, a good understanding of multiphase fluid flow in fractures is required to reduce oil bypass and increase recovery from these reservoirs. This research investigates the effect of heterogeneity and <b>injection</b> <b>rates</b> on oil bypass and also the various techniques used for the improvement of sweep efficiency in heterogeneous systems. Several coreflood experiments were performed using homogeneous and heterogeneous cores and a 4 th generation X-Ray CT scanner was used to visualize heterogeneity and fluid flow in the core. Porosity and saturation measurements were made during the course of the experiment. The experimental results indicate that <b>injection</b> <b>rates</b> play a very important role in affecting the recovery process, more so in the presence of fractures. At high <b>injection</b> <b>rates,</b> faster breakthrough of CO 2 and higher oil bypass were observed than at low <b>injection</b> <b>rates.</b> But very low <b>injection</b> <b>rates</b> are not attractive from an economic point of view. Hence water viscosified with a polymer was injected directly into the fracture to divert CO 2 flow into the matrix and delay breakthrough, similar to the WAG process. Although the breakthrough time reduced considerably, water ??leak off?? into the matrix was very high. To counter this problem, a cross-linked gel was used in the fracture for conformance control. The gel was found to overcome ??leak off?? problems and effectively divert CO 2 flow into the matrix. This experimental research will serve to increase the understanding of fluid flow and conformance control methods in fractured reservoirs...|$|R
