5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and <b>fall</b> <b>over.</b> At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the capsize mode {{eigenvalues}} switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, is called the capsize speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to <b>fall</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Friends Thongs and Octopus evade {{security}} guards in a hospital, having stolen money and cancer medication from the safe. Meanwhile, {{a newborn baby}} to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the {{security guards}} give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> the side—the baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's minivan.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately £1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about the tower and the risk that it might <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients. As an alternative to demolition, it was taken into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms {{of muscles}} {{in either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The person does not <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|As Cayman-Global attacks Eurocorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's {{office to}} prevent him from {{activating}} the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both Eurocorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> a ledge to his death. As the game ends, Eurocorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.|$|E

5|$|For the Mexican National Trios Championship challengers Los Boricuas, {{represented}} by Gran Markus Jr, Violencia and Poder Boricua in this case, {{was accompanied by}} Pierroth Jr. and La Nazi. The outside interference helped Los Boricuas win the first <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari. In {{the third and final}} fall, both Mr. Niebla and Safari piled on Gran Markus Jr. to pin him and retain the championship. After the loss Pierroth Jr. berated Gran Markus Jr. over the loss. The fourth match of the night featured brothers Dr. Wagner Jr. and Black Tiger on opposite sides as they each captained a trio. In the third and deciding fall Dr. Wagner Jr. pinned Negro Casas to bring the victory for himself, Universo 2000, Juventud Guerrera and Fuerza Guerrera.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{scheduled}} bout was a Three Way Elimination {{match between}} DDP, Kevin Nash, and Monty Brown. The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> the top rope and down to the floor. With Nash eliminated, it was down to Brown and DDP. After the two fought back and forth for a few minutes, Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he ran against the opposite ropes and performed a running shoulder block {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to <b>fall</b> <b>over)</b> will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Edinburgh in 1827, Darwin learnt about marine {{invertebrates}} while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant, and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831, he had studied geology under Adam Sedgwick. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship's complement carried out its hydrographic survey. FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology before they left. On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on geology. Lyell's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters, and the second volume, which was sent to Darwin during the voyage, gave more detail. Darwin received it in November 1832.|$|E

5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events and backgrounds for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, in the script for one scene, Athena was going to trip and <b>fall</b> <b>over,</b> while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down stairs, and added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had been. After finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E
5|$|While Kiara and Kovu's {{friendship}} {{continues to}} grow, Simba, encouraged by Nala, attempts to show Kovu kindness by spending {{a day with}} him. Realizing that Kovu is beginning to side with Simba because of his love for Kiara, Zira ambushes and attacks Simba. Convinced by Zira that Kovu {{is responsible for the}} ambush, Simba exiles him and forbids Kiara to see him, but she makes her father realize that he is acting irrationally, before leaving to find Kovu. When a battle ensues between the Pride Landers and the Outsiders, Kiara and Kovu arrive and stop them, with Kiara telling them that they are one. When a furious Zira attacks Simba, she is intercepted by Kiara, causing the two to <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> the edge of a cliff. Having landed safely on a ledge, Kiara offers to help Zira, who is struggling to hang on. However, Zira, consumed by her resentment towards Simba, falls to her death. Simba finally approves of Kiara's love for Kovu and reconciles with his daughter, and accepts the two lions as future king and queen of the Pride Lands.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> the edge of the pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
