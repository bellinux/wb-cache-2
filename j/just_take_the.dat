5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E

25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> money and call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends {{it back to the}} Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E

500|$|According to lead {{designer}} Chris Avellone, Planescape: Torment {{was inspired}} by books, comics, and games, including Archie Comics, The Chronicles of Amber, The Elementals and Shadowrun. The game's 1997 outline also makes references to The Lord of the Rings to describe some characters. While working on Planescape: Torment, Avellone was simultaneously working on Fallout 2. In an interview from 2007, he says that Fallout 2 helped him rethink the possibilities of dialogue in Planescape: Torment (and in later games he was involved with, including Neverwinter Nights 2). Producer Guido Henkel commented on taking liberties with the AD rules by simplifying them: [...] "I think we still take the AD rules very seriously and we follow those rules. We <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> liberty of removing some of the 'overhead'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before a Tiger Stadium record 65,000 fans, LSU {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats, 32–7. It {{was the first}} time the stadium sold out since the addition of over 20,000 seats behind the south end zone in 1954. Police officers were called in to control the crowds at ticket booths. Most of the fans were for LSU, as the 4–0 start to the season and blowout win over Miami had generated high interest in the team; it was predicted Kentucky brought only 300 fans. SEC commissioner Bernie Moore, former head coach of LSU, also attended the game. When it was over he was asked which players he would pick from the Tigers if he had to coach again.

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussions neared {{completion}} {{regarding a}} financial settlement by January 14, {{and would be}} in place following O'Brien's final week of shows—January 18–22—a concession O'Brien pushed to give his program a proper farewell. Movement on the settlement slowed when run by General Electric (GE) executives, then-owners of NBCUniversal. NBC held several requests, among those that he not bring Howard Stern on the show his final week (a request the O'Brien camp found slightly comical) and that they see the show's final week of scripts (O'Brien never sent them). Talks {{for much of the}} rest of the week got nowhere, and a Saturday New York Post story ran claiming that O'Brien's staff felt [...] "betrayed" [...] by his actions. The article claimed that the staff did not understand why O'Brien could not <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> 12:05 slot, in order to keep their jobs, as instead he was controlled by his ego. O'Brien was infuriated by the story—which he assumed a direct plant from NBC—as nearly all of his staff agreed he should walk. He was personally appalled that the network challenged his character, as stressing severance for his employees was enormously important to him (he had paid them out of his own pocket during the writer's strike three years earlier).|$|E
