50|$|The electrical, <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> of such {{a modern}} {{incinerator}} unit includes a main switch, an emergency switch {{as well as all}} necessary safety catches, contactors, relays and clamps, key switches for the start up and so on. All measuring, controlling and adjusting functions are realized in a modern mobile incineration plant. There are some safety limits which are processed by the hardware {{of such a}} plant. For start-up and operation of the mobile units, most have their own electrical generator on board for power supply. The whole equipment has to comply with European (e.g. DIN 41494, DIN 41488) and/or international (e.g. IEC Publication 297) standards.|$|E
50|$|At {{the behest}} of the Russian Federation, Cuba {{negotiated}} with European firms such as Siemens, Cegelec and Skoda to provide <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> <b>equipment</b> to upgrade the safety standards of the plant. In the 1970s Russia had successfully constructed Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant in Finland through a joint venture with Siemens to comply with Finnish nuclear regulations. In 1992 Siemens visited the Juragua plant and agreed to install the systems but Russia was unable to pay in hard currency as demanded. Cuba was also incapable of delivering the $21 million payment that Siemens was asking for. On September 5, 1992, Cuban President Fidel Castro announced a suspension of construction at Juragua due to Cuba's inability to meet the financial terms set by Russia to complete the reactors. Castro stated that more than 1.1 billion dollars had been invested.|$|E

40|$|The {{subsurface}} ice probe (SIPR) is a proposed apparatus that would bore into ice to depths {{as great as}} hundreds of meters by melting the ice and pumping the samples of meltwater to the surface. Originally intended for use in exploration of {{subsurface ice}} on Mars and other remote planets, the SIPR {{could also be used}} on Earth as an alternative to coring, drilling, and melting apparatuses heretofore used to sample Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. The SIPR would include an assembly of <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> electronic <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> at the surface, connected via a tether to a compact assembly of boring, sampling, and sensor equipment in the borehole (see figure). Placing as much equipment as possible at the surface would help to attain primary objectives of minimizing power consumption, sampling with high depth resolution, and unobstructed imaging of the borehole wall. To the degree to which these requirements would be satisfied, the SIPR would offer advantages over the aforementioned ice-probing systems...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} stage of {{training}} in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC) in Goose Creek, SC. The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> (I&CE) theory and maintenance. The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of Nuclear Power School. The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&CE theory and maintenance. Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, ETNs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified and retrained into another rating in order to remain in the Navy. ETN is not eligible for direct conversion to ET. This means that for an ETN to become and ET they must attend the ET 'A' school.|$|E
40|$|The LANSCE (Los Alamos Neutron Science Center) {{control system}} upgrade program {{continues}} with the impending {{replacement of the}} RICE (Remote <b>Instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Equipment)</b> subsystem. The RICE subsystem upgrade is a challenge because of its technology (late 1960 s), number of channels (> 10, 000), and unique characteristics (all-modules data takes, timed/flavored data takes). The plan is to replace at least the non-timed data and the command portions of the subsystem with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). We discuss motivations, technological challenges, proof-of-principle, and planning. The boundary condition, as usual, is that we must implement these major changes on a running accelerator...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for {{the suppression of the}} sway of rotary crane payloads. In contrast to closed-loop control methods which encounter significant practical application problems, the proposed method is based simply on the preprocessing of all the commanded crane inputs by a properly designed finite impulse response (FIR) filter. A four-degrees-of-freedom (413017) model for the rotary crane system is considered, incorporating both the hoisting and the slewing motions and thus able to handle cases where hoisting can be simultaneously applied to the rotary motion. Although the resulting dynamic system is strongly non-linear and time varying, the method is shown effectively to suppress, in a quite robust, time and energy efficient way, both the transient as well as the residual sway of the payload. Moreover, additional advantages of the proposed method are that no dynamic modelling of the crane is required, and that the applicability of the method is quite easy and general, without the need for any additional <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} minimum {{inventory}} (MI) of human system interfaces (HSIs) (i. e. alarms, <b>controls,</b> <b>and</b> displays) for plant's safe operation and represents the analytic procedure on the MI of HSIs {{developed for the}} digital <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> (I&C) <b>equipments</b> in the main control room (MCR). The MI of HSIs in the MCR indicates the HSIs that the operator always needs available to: (1) monitor the status; (2) perform and confirm a reactor trip; (3) perform <b>and</b> confirm a <b>controlled</b> shutdown of the reactor; (4) actuate safety related systems; (5) analyze failure conditions of the normal HSIs; (6) implement the plant's emergency operating procedures (EOPs); (7) bring the plant to a safe condition; (8) carry out those operator actions shown to be risk important by the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). The proposed analytic procedure on the MI of HSIs in this study {{can be used to}} (1) identify the MI of HSIs and their design requirements; and (2) addresses design requirements and implementation for the MI of HSIs. The contribution {{of this study is to}} describe the MI of HSIs needed to implement the plant's EOPs, to bring the plant to a safe condition, and to carry out those operator actions shown to be risk important by the PRA. ...|$|R

40|$|The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) {{project was}} started in 1994 under {{sponsorship}} of the International Energy Agency (IEA). This project, which is in its conceptual design phase, is aimed at fulfilling {{the need for a}} high-flux. high-fluence neutron irradiation facility for fusion materials research and development. Initial assessments of the materials testing needs have shown that the testing space provided in the high-flux region of the IFMIF Test Cell is adequate for development of a data base for the engineering design of a demonstration fusion power-producing-reactor (DEMO). Using the proposed set of miniaturized test specimens, compact test module configurations have been developed for several reference loadings. The test modules have been integrated into a test assembly that includes the coolant flow system for the test modules, <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment,</b> and a shield to minimize activation to ancillary areas of the IFMIF facility. These test assemblies are configured to facilitate installation, removal, and transport to hot cells using remote handling equipment...|$|E
40|$|The Murmansk Initiative-RF (MI) was {{conceived}} {{to provide the}} Russian Federation (RF) with the capacity to manage low-level liquid radioactive waste (LLRW) and {{comply with the requirements}} of the London Convention that prohibit ocean dumping. The trilateral project among Norway, the RF, and the United States of America (U. S.) began in 1994 and was the first to utilize exclusively Russian subcontractors to upgrade and expand an existing LLRW treatment plant on the premises of RTP Atomflot in Murmansk, Russia. The project moved quickly through the design phase. Progress during the construction phase was somewhat slower because of difficulties with acquisition of hardware, inexperience with automated <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment,</b> and unexpected design changes in the cementation unit. The project advanced into the test-operation phase, which is currently underway, in June 2001. Initial runs with liquid waste have revealed that procedures for unloading spent ion-exchange sorbents could be improved and that sludges formed during removal of alkaline-earth metals should be compacted in order for the facility to operate at its full potential. Resolution of these issues is expected within the next few months...|$|E
40|$|Smoke can {{adversely}} affect digital electronics; {{in the short}} term, {{it can lead to}} circuit bridging and in the long term to corrosion of metal parts. This report is a summary of the work to date and component-level tests by Sandia National Laboratories for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to determine the impact of smoke on digital <b>instrumentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment.</b> The component tests focused on short-term effects such as circuit bridging in typical components and the factors that can influence how much the smoke will affect them. These factors include the component technology and packaging, physical board protection, and environmental conditions such as the amount of smoke, temperature of burn, and humidity level. The likelihood of circuit bridging was tested by measuring leakage currents and converting those currents to resistance in ohms. Hermetically sealed ceramic packages were more resistant to smoke than plastic packages. Coating the boards with an acrylic spray provided some protection against circuit bridging. The smoke generation factors that affect the resistance the most are humidity, fuel level, and burn temperature. The use of CO{sub 2 } as a fire suppressant, the presence of galvanic metal, and the presence of PVC did not significantly affect the outcome of these results...|$|E
