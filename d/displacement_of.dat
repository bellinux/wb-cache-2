5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.|$|E
30|$|Since each term of Eqs.

30|$|When the MD {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out for every 50 Δt, <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> the topmost FE nodes were calculated through <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms around the FE nodes. The <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> these FE nodes were then used as initial conditions for FE calculations. Quasi-static elastic constitutive relationship and Newton–Raphson iteration were employed due to that <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> the FE region were very small compared {{with those in the}} MD region. When FE calculation was finished, the <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms on the bottom layer could be obtained according to their positions in the corresponding elements, and the positions of the atoms were updated by using their displacements. So, one could obtain a new MD region and perform MD simulations again. More detailed working processes about multiscale method were given in Ref. [22].|$|R

5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion of the cluster may occur via the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster moving at once. All of these processes involve a change in the cluster’s center of mass.|$|E
5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} {{occurs when}} adjacent sub-units of a cluster {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the process begins with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is essentially sequential displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{solution for the}} prediction of internal forces and <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> a jointed segmental precast circular tunnel lining. The effects of joint stiffness {{on the performance of}} the tunnel lining are discussed. The `force method' is used to determine the internal forces and <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> jointed tunnel lining. Five shield-driven tunnel cases are adopted to study the effects of joint stiffness, soil resistance, joint distribution and joint number on the internal forces and <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> circular tunnels. Laboratory model tests are conducted to verify the proposed analytical solution. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E

Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. The operation led to a massive <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> Haifa's Arab population. According to The Economist at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{measured}} integrated intensities of 26 {{reflections of}} the B 2 -phase of titanium nickelide single crystal and determined structure factors for these reflections. Based on the structure factors, mean squares <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni and Ti atoms {{with respect to the}} crystal-lattice sites have been determined. After that we determined the mean squares <b>of</b> atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti in temperature range of existence of the B 2 -pase, at temperatures Т 1 = 328 K and T 2 = 376 K. We separated the mean squares <b>of</b> atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti into static and dynamic ones. The mean squares <b>of</b> dynamic <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni and Ti atoms are identical, but the mean square <b>of</b> static <b>displacements</b> is greater by a factor of 4. 7 for Ni atoms than for Ti atoms. The Debye temperature calculated from the mean squares <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni atoms is 360 K; that calculated for Ti atoms in a similar way is 390 K. The large value <b>of</b> complete atomic <b>displacements</b> in TiNi is due to static rather than dynamic <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms, mainly due to static <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> nickel atoms...|$|R

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a geomagnetic reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's crust.|$|E
