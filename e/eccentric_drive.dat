The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts. Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.

5000|$|The {{most common}} Mechanical Presses use an <b>eccentric</b> <b>drive</b> {{to move the}} press's ram slide, length of stroke or slide travel depends on the {{crankshaft}} or eccentric, whereas hydraulic cylinders are used in hydraulic presses. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage for blanking operations.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{gridiron}} valves {{are used}} as secondary valves, they were commonly mounted on the inlet side of the valve chamber for the primary slide valve. They were driven by a separate valve gear, usually a separate eccentric set {{in advance of the}} main eccentric. When operating, the additional advance moves the gridiron valve to apply cut-off ahead of the main valve. To vary the expansion they provide, the stroke of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>drive</b> can be varied by an adjustable linkage. When this is adjusted to zero throw, the expansion valve remains fully open and the engine works without expansion. [...] Although the use of a secondary gridiron valve was an early technique, it also remained in service with increasingly sophisticated valves and actuation, throughout the history of stationary engines. McIntosh and Seymour engines used one driven by a cam and toggle arrangement that moved intermittently and stood still when open, giving precise timing, and independent adjustment of each valve movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{dragline}} {{was invented}} in 1904 by John W. Page (as a partner of the firm Page & Schnable Contracting) for use in digging the Chicago Canal. By 1912, Page realized that building draglines was more lucrative than contracting, so he created the Page Engineering Company to build draglines. Page built its first crude walking dragline in 1923. These used legs operated by rack and pinion on a separate frame that lifted the crane. The body was then pulled forward by chain on a roller track and then lowered again. Page developed the first diesel engines exclusively for dragline application in 1924. Page also invented the arched dragline bucket, a design still commonly used today by draglines from many other manufacturers, and in the 1960s pioneered an archless bucket design. With its walking mechanism badly behind that of competitor Monighan (see below), Page updated their mechanism to an <b>eccentric</b> <b>drive</b> in 1935. This much improved mechanism gave a proper elliptical motion and was used until 1988. Page modernized its draglines further with the 700 series in 1954. Page's largest dragline was the Model 757 delivered to the Obed Mine near Hinton, Alberta in 1983. It featured a 75-yard bucket on a 298-foot boom and an operating weight of 4,500 tons. In 1988, Harnischfeger Corporation (P&H Mining Equipment) purchased Page Engineering Company.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an example of}} a link-drive mechanism for a deep drawing mechanical press. Because of its characteristics such a drive is much more appropriate than conventional crankshaft or <b>eccentric</b> <b>drive.</b> The existing design of the drive has proved unsatisfactory and does not meet all the demands and constraints, which are ideal for deep drawing process. Optimization of the drive is therefore necessary. The intention is to achieve the required velocity characteristics in a defined area of movement. Firstly, the drive is analyzed and a mathematical model is made and prepared for optimization procedure. The process is time-dependent, so it cannot be used directly in the optimization algorithm. Mathematical model is transformed intoa form suitable for the standard non-linear optimization procedure and then optimization is carried out. The method used is sequential quadratic programming. The final objective of the optimization process is to find such dimensions of link-drive members that the given requirements are satisfied in the best possible manner...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008027524 B 3 UPAB: 20090928 NOVELTY - The {{laser cutting}} unit is moved conventionally, {{relative}} to the workpiece (1. 4). In a novel arrangement, the cutting nozzle (1. 3) fastened to the cutting head (1) can also be moved in two axial directions, parallel {{to the surface of}} the workpiece. This additional movement is caused by a separate drive system. The new arrangement increases the working area of the laser cutter. The focusing optic (1. 2) is a telecentric planar field optic and/or a telecentric F-theta optic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The cutting nozzle rotates about an axis directed at right angles to the workpiece surface. The rotational axis of the nozzle, or of its opening, is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cutting head. An <b>eccentric</b> <b>drive</b> moves the cutting nozzle. A double-eccentric drive is used, with two drive motors. These are independently-controlled. The eccentric drives are connected. They are arranged one inside the other, or one above the other. Through combined nozzle movement and beam (10) deflection, the operational area achieved on the workpiece reaches at least 7 mm 2. The cutting nozzle is alternatively moved by two independently-controlled linear drives. The drives used are: moving coil, pneumatic or hydraulic. The linear drives act on the cutting nozzle from the radial exterior of the unit, and are articulated to it. The laser beam and cutting gas are directed through the nozzle onto the workpiece. The nozzle opening is circular, elliptical or slot-shaped. The nozzle is held by a cross-slide assembly with linear drives to each slide. The beam deflection includes an oscillatory motion. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding laser cutting method. USE - Agile laser cutting equipment with a mirror deflecting the focused beam. ADVANTAGE - By superimposing mechanical and optical deflections, variation of cutting direction can be achieved with smaller radii. This accelerates the cutting operation, increasing production and saving cutting gas. At the same time, stressing of the equipment by accelerations and torques is reduced. Wear is reduced and equipment life is extended. Movements of individual drives become smoother. Agility is increased without increase in the size of the gas opening, so cutting gas is conserved. The additional drives permit simpler optics to be used if required. This minimizes cost. Advantages of differing types of nozzle drives are discussed further in the disclosure. Gas flow is readily matched with the cutting requirement and either conical-cylindrical or Laval nozzles can be used...|$|E
40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on single-cylinder test engines to determine the performance characteristics of four types of combustion chambers designed for aircraft oil engines. Two of the combustion chambers studied were bulb-type precombustion chambers, the connecting orifice of one having been designed to produce high turbulence by tangential air flow in both the precombustion chamber and the cylinder. The other two were integral combustion chambers, one being dome-shaped and the other pent-roof shaped. The injection systems used included cam and <b>eccentric</b> <b>driven</b> fuel pumps, and diaphragm and spring-loaded fuel-injection valves. A diaphragm type maximum cylinder pressure indicator was used in part of these investigations with which the cylinder pressures were controlled to definite valves. The performance of the engines when equipped {{with each of the}} combustion chambers is discussed. The best performance for the tests reported was obtained with a bulb-type combustion chamber designed to give a high degree of turbulence within the bulb and cylinder. (author) ...|$|R

No. 956 was first given a different variation of the standard arrangement, then brought into line with No. 959, but by the end of 1922 both had been altered again, this time to the same mixed gear arrangement as 957/958. It would have been difficult to retrofit Walschaerts gear to the inside cylinder (because there would be no mounting-point for the combination lever) but it seems strange that a modified Walschaerts gear was not used. It would have been possible to add a second <b>eccentric</b> to <b>drive</b> the combination lever.|$|R

And based on the PDJ- 4 belt drive experiment facility giving examples of analysis, we draw the conclusion that with the increase of tension, rotary motion error increases at the same time. Thus it will have a greater rotary motion error when the tension is too large. This paper proposed the scheme and measures to improve that error eventually...|$|R

50|$|In {{steam engines}} and {{internal}} combustion engines, valves {{are required to}} allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the response of}} an accretion disk {{to the presence of}} a perturbing protoplanet embedded in the disk through time dependent hydrodynamical simulations. The disk is treated as a two-dimensional viscous fluid and the planet is kept on a fixed orbit. We run a set of simulations varying the planet mass, and the viscosity and temperature of the disk. All runs are followed until they reach a quasi-equilibrium state. We find that for planetary masses above a certain minimum mass, already 3 M_Jup for a viscosity of nu = 10 ^{- 5 }, the disk makes a transition from a nearly circular state into an eccentric state. Increasing the planetary mass leads to a saturation of disk eccentricity with a maximum value of around 0. 25. The transition to the <b>eccentric</b> state is <b>driven</b> by the excitation of an m= 2 spiral wave at the outer 1 : 3 Lindblad resonance. The effect occurs only if the planetary masses are large enough to clear a sufficiently wide and deep gap to reduce the damping effect of the outer 1 : 2 Lindblad resonance. An increase in viscosity and temperature in the disk, which both tend to close the gap, have an adverse influence on the disk eccentricity. In the eccentric state the mass accretion rate onto the planet is greatly enhanced, an effect that may ease the formation of massive planets beyond about 5 M_Jup that are otherwise difficult to reach.
