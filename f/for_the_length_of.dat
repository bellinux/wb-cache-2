5|$|After {{crossing}} Golden Avenue, I-194 curves to {{the northwest}} to meet the M-96 (Columbia Avenue) interchange. The freeway runs underneath the Columbia Avenue overpass before running parallel {{to the west bank}} of the Kalamazoo River. The freeway crosses the river at the southern end of Lower Mill Pond. Curving back around to the northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of the freeway end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue. All of I-194 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways, and it is concurrent with M-66 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the freeway.|$|E

5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below).

The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity.

40|$|Aim: Several pre, peri and {{postoperative}} factors may have implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> resected small bowel segments in Crohn's disease patients. It might also affect patient outcome. We reviewed the current literature on factors and their implications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> resected small bowel segments and possible correlations with postoperative outcome. Method: Searches were independently engineered {{by the authors}} and a research-librarian in MEDLINE and OVID databases using PubMed and EMBASE engines in compliance with PRISMA recommendations. All original articles, reviews and guidelines published {{in the period of}} 1985 – 2016 with last search date 13 th of February 2016 on bowel resection in Crohn's disease patients were assessed for inclusion. Results: We identified 52 studies for synthesis. Preoperative: Perforation as indication for surgery and increased visceral obesity may be factors resulting in longer <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> resected small bowel segments. Administration of total parenteral nutrition might reduce resection lengths. Perioperative: No difference in resection lengths in elective versus acute surgery, laparoscopic versus open approaches or in case of intra-operative blood transfusions. Stapled anastomoses might conserve more bowel than sutured ones. Postoperative: <b>The</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resected small bowel segments most likely have no impact on recurrence rates.

25|$|We {{assume the}} world {{was created in the}} Hebrew month of Nissan, not Tishrei. So hour 1 (sunset) on Wednesday on this chart {{represents}} the beginning of Tekufat Nissan (Spring) {{in the first year of}} creation, the Hebrew year 1. For the purpose of Birkat Hachama, the calculation of Samuel of Nehardea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> a tropical year is used not the more accurate calculation of Adda bar Ahavah. Therefore, a year is assumed to be 52 weeks and 1 day and 6 hours (365.25 days). This means that a year after creation Tekufat Nissan will occur 1 day and 6 hours later on this chart, or on Thursday at the 6th hour, Jupiter. Each year this will shift another day and 6 hours. It will take 28 years for Tekufat Nissan to return to being on Wednesday at twilight. It is worth noting that the true spring equinox occurs on March 21 yet Birkat Hachama is said 18 days later. This inaccuracy accrued over thousands of years as a result of using the inexact calculation of Samuel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Limb bone {{lengths and}} bone mineral density (BMD) {{have been used}} to assess the bone growth and the risk of bone {{fractures}} in pigs, respectively. It has been suggested that limb bone lengths and BMD are under genetic control. However, the knowledge about the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limb bone <b>lengths</b> and mineralisatinon is limited in pigs. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting limb bone <b>lengths</b> and BMD <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal femur in a White Duroc × Erhualian resource population. Results Limb bone lengths and femoral bone mineral density (fBMD) were measured in a total of 1021 and 116 F 2 animals, respectively. There were strong positive correlations among <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> limb bones and medium positive correlations between <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> limb bones and fBMD. A whole-genome scan involving 183 microsatellite markers across the pig genome revealed 35 QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> limb bone <b>lengths</b> and 2 <b>for</b> femoral BMD. <b>The</b> most significant QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> five limb bones were mapped on two chromosomes affecting all 5 limb bones traits. One was detected around 57 cM on pig chromosome (SSC) 7 with the largest F -value of more than 26 and 95 % confidence intervals of less than 5 cM, providing a crucial start point to identify <b>the</b> causal genes <b>for</b> these traits. <b>The</b> Erhualian alleles were associated with longer limb bones. The other was located on SSCX with a peak at 50 – 53 cM, whereas alleles from the White Duroc breed increased <b>the</b> bone <b>length.</b> Many QTL identified are homologous to the human genomic regions containing QTL for bone-related traits and a list of interesting candidate genes. Conclusion This study detected <b>the</b> QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> scapula, ulna, humerus and tibia and fBMD in <b>the</b> pig <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. Moreover, several new QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pig femoral <b>length</b> were found. As correlated traits, QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> five limb bones were mainly located in the same genomic regions. The most promising QTL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> five limb bones on SSC 7 merits further investigation. </p...|$|R
