50|$|The Panic buying at <b>forecourts</b> {{across the}} UK in March 2012 began after Unite members {{threatened}} {{to vote to}} strike. According to their critics (including the AA), both statements from UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Cabinet Minister Francis Maude, and poor media coverage, encouraged {{tens of thousands of}} motorists to panic buy, leading to a number of <b>forecourts</b> running out of fuel.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} lodges on Euston Road and statues {{now on the}} <b>forecourt,</b> few relics of the old station survive. The National Railway Museum's {{collection}} at York includes Edward Hodges Baily's statue of George Stephenson, both from the Great Hall; the entrance gates; and an 1846 turntable discovered during demolition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} side of the <b>forecourt</b> are three flagpoles.

5|$|In September 1999, {{high winds}} during a heavy storm {{resulted}} in the dislodgement of some domes in the canopy over the building's <b>forecourt.</b> This led to the closure of St Georges Terrace entrance as a safety precaution. The building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, subsequently initiated legal action against the tower's builder Multiplex.|$|E
5|$|In late April 1917, Whittle {{spent three}} days in a field {{hospital}} receiving treatment for psoriasis, before embarking for England on attachment to a training battalion. Joining the unit on 6 May, he once again underwent an eight-day furlough in a military hospital later in the month. During this time, Whittle attended an investiture ceremony in the <b>forecourt</b> of Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated by King GeorgeV with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|The library {{block is}} {{predominantly}} clad in glass, fitted with horizontal fins, on its frontage {{with the main}} road.

5|$|The {{station has}} a single large concourse, {{separate}} from the train shed. Originally, there were no seats installed there to deter vagrants and crime, but these were added following complaints from passengers. A few remnants of the older station remain: two Portland stone entrance lodges and a war memorial. A statue of Robert Stephenson by Carlo Marochetti, previously in the old ticket hall, stands in the <b>forecourt.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of {{the building}} remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008. The pair of stone piers in the <b>forecourt</b> of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E

5|$|Charing Cross, at the {{junction}} of Strand and Whitehall, {{was the site of}} the first public monument in what is now the City of Westminster, the cross commissioned by Edward I late in the 13th century in memory of his queen, Eleanor of Castile. Destroyed by order of the Long Parliament in 1647, the Eleanor cross was replaced after the Restoration by the equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur, the oldest public sculpture now standing in the borough. In 1865 a facsimile of the cross was erected in the <b>forecourt</b> of Charing Cross railway station. Charing Cross was declared the official centre of London in 1831 and a plaque marking this status was installed near Le Sueur's statue in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Hearth-tax {{assessments}} of 1674 show the original hall {{to have been}} one of the largest houses in Cheshire, its 42 hearths being surpassed only by Cholmondeley House and Rocksavage, neither of which have survived. As depicted in a painting of around 1710, the original building was square with sides of around , and featured gabled projecting bays and groups of octagonal chimney stacks. Built around a central open courtyard, the interior had a great hall and long gallery; the main entrance led to a screens passage and the main staircase was in a small east hall. Externally, there was a walled <b>forecourt</b> and formal walled gardens; a range of separate service buildings was located to the west.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the 2nd Marquis of Annandale left Craigiehall to his nephew, Charles Hope-Weir (1710–1791), {{second son}} of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hope-Weir {{travelled}} to Europe on the grand tour in 1754-55, taking {{with him the}} young architect Robert Adam, and was inspired to improve the Craigiehall policies on his return. A walled <b>forecourt</b> and the formal gardens {{in front of the}} house were removed. He also planted numerous trees across the estate, laid out avenues, and had several garden buildings constructed. A lake was excavated, and a new bridge over the River Almond was constructed to link the neighbouring estate of Lennie, which Hope-Weir had bought in 1750.|$|E

A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air <b>forecourt</b> between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} proceeded, the CCE {{continued to}} submit bills to Parliament. The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1904, which received assent on 22 July 1904, granted permission to buy additional {{land for the}} station at Tottenham Court Road, for a new station at Mornington Crescent and for changes at Charing Cross. The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1905 received assent on 4 August 1905. It dealt mainly with the acquisition of the subsoil under part of the <b>forecourt</b> of the South Eastern Railway's Charing Cross station so that the CCE's station could be excavated during the 3 months closure following the recent roof collapse.|$|E
