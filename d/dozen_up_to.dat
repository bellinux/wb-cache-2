There, males, which individually may frequent the same agglomeration for subsequent days, are seen to dehydrate nectar.

Except for what they can carry off from their home colony, other sources from which congregated males may obtain their nectar are still unknown...|$|R

5000|$|She was {{the girlfriend}} of [...] "Captain" [...] Virgulino Ferreira da Silva, {{better known as}} Lampião (Portuguese pronunciation: lɐ̃ˈpjɐ̃w, meaning [...] "lantern" [...] or [...] "oil lamp"), the outlaw bandit leader. She {{was raised in the}} Jeremoabo area of the State of Bahia. [...] Virgulinos father was killed in a {{confrontation}} with the police in 1919. Virgulino sought vengeance and proved to be extremely violent in doing so. He became an outlaw and was incessantly pursued by the police (whom he called macacos or monkeys). The cangaceiro bandits weapons were mostly stolen or obtained by bribery from the police and paramilitary units and consisted of Mauser military rifles and a variety of smaller firearms including Winchester rifles, revolvers and the prized Luger semi-automatic pistol. The band, whose numbers varied between about a <b>dozen</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a hundred, attacked small towns and farms in seven Brazilian states, fought pitched battles with paramilitary police, killed people and cattle, extorted money, kidnapped hostages for ransom, tortured, fire-branded, maimed, raped, and ransacked. Maria Bonita joined Lampião and his bandits in 1930, aged in her early twenties. Like other women in the band, she dressed like the cangaceiros and participated in many of their actions. At the time she joined the bandits she was semi-estranged from her husband, José Nenem, a cobbler. The band travelled on horseback wearing leather outfits including hats, jackets, sandals, ammunition belts, and trousers to protect them from the thorns of the caatinga (dry shrubs, cacti and brushwood typical of the dry hinterland of Brazils Northeast). The women who joined bandit groups were often termed cangaceiras. The cangaceiras were as hardy as the male bandits, they were also well-armed and were trained in the use of weapons. They were often involved in battles with the military police; Maria Bonita and a second female bandit were killed in a shoot out, and another woman in the band, Dadá, was wounded in a later battle with the police and had to have her leg amputated.|$|E

With an effective radius of about 17. 5 pc and a velocity dispersion of 45 km/s this object {{may be viewed as}} one of the recently discovered ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Its intermediate age, however, precludes an origin as a stripped nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. The galaxy NGC 7252 is a merger remnant from two gas-rich disc galaxies. Interactions between two gas-rich galaxies lead to bursts of intense star formation. The age of the interaction and the age of W 3 are in good agreement, suggesting that was W 3 probably formed in the starburst. We propose a formation scenario for W 3. Observations of interacting galaxies reveal regions of strong star formation forming <b>dozens</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> hundreds of star cluster in confined regions of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> several hundred parsec in diameter.

40|$|Introduction: An {{outstanding}} {{question in}} neuroblastoma treatment is whether clinically useful biomarkers {{of response to}} therapy can be identified. Biomarkers that allow monitoring of targeted drug pathway activation are highly desirable for the clinical follow-up of patients treated with such drugs. Minimally-invasive methods for patient follow-up, like measuring expression levels of miRNAs in serum, may be an elegant approach to obtain a higher specificity, sensitivity and lower handling time than other currently used biomarkers. Method: MYCN/ALKR 1279 Q transgenic mice were treated with crizotinib. Mice carrying orthotopic xenografts of SH-SY 5 Y cells were treated with RG 7388 or temsirolimus. Serum samples of these mice were collected at different time points before, during and after treatment as well as matching end-point tumor material. Small RNA sequencing was optimized for low input and depleted for abundant non-relevant RNA sequences. Small RNA sequencing and whole miRNome RT-qPCR was performed to identify circulating miRNAs that are responsive to treatment or tumor cell engraftment. Results: We were able to observe expression changes for <b>dozens</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> one hundred circulating miRNAs, some of which had a > 10 fold change in expression value. miRNAs showed differential expression both {{as a result of}} treatment and tumor cell engraftment. These include miRNAs with known roles in neuroblastoma tumor biology like the oncogenic miR- 17 - 92 cluster. Moreover, for some miRNAs expression changes were found to be possibly drug-specific. Conclusion: These data encourage further investigation of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for treatment response, also in a clinical setting...|$|R

About one-third of the spawning aggregations sites for this species have disappeared due to over-fishing. Annual spawning occurs in specific locations on the outer reef shelf during the days around the full moon of December and January. Aggregations can range anywhere from a <b>dozen</b> <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> several thousand adult individuals and are usually in the same site each year, making an easy target for fishermen.
