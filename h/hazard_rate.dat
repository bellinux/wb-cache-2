50|$|In actuarial science, the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the rate}} of death for lives aged x. For a life aged x, the force of {{mortality}} t years later is the force of mortality for a (x + t)-year old. The <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> is also called the failure rate. <b>Hazard</b> <b>rate</b> and failure rate are names used in reliability theory.|$|E
50|$|In gerontology, late-life {{mortality}} deceleration is {{the phenomenon}} of <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> increasing at a decreasing rate in late life - rather than increasing exponentially as in the Gompertz law - {{and in some cases}} plateauing (asymptoting) at a constant rate. Graphically, on a log-linear semi-log plot (linear in the x-axis of age, logarithmic in the y-axis of <b>hazard</b> <b>rate),</b> an exponential function becomes linear, and the Gompertz law amounts to the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> increasing linearly with age. Late-life mortality deceleration corresponds to <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> increasing more slowly than linearly (on a log-linear graph), instead curving and possibly plateauing.|$|E
40|$|Comparison of two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> is {{important}} in applications related to times to occurrence of a specific event. Conventional comparison procedures, such as the logrank, Gehan-Wilcoxon, and Peto-Peto tests, are powerful only when the two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> do not cross each other. Because crossing <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> are common in practice, a number of procedures have been proposed in the literature for comparing such rates. However, most of these procedures only consider the alternative hypothesis with crossing hazard rates; many other realistic cases, including those when the two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> run parallel to each other, are excluded from consideration. In this paper, we propose a two-stage procedure that considers all possible alternatives, including ones with crossing or running parallel <b>hazard</b> <b>rates.</b> To define its significance level and p-value properly, a new procedure for handling the crossing <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> problem is suggested, which has the property that its test statistic is asymptotically independent of the test statistic of the logrank test. We show that the two-stage procedure, with the logrank test and the suggested procedure for handling the crossing <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> problem used in its two stages, performs well in applications in comparing two <b>hazard</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{determinants}} of ministerial <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> in Britain from 1945 to 1997. We focus on three sets of attributes (i) personal characteristics of the minister; (ii) political characteristics of the minister; and (iii) characteristics pertaining to the government in which the minister serves. We find that educational background increases ministers' capacity to survive, that female ministers have lower <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> and older ministers have higher <b>hazard</b> <b>rates.</b> Experienced ministers have higher <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> than newly appointed ministers. Ministerial rank increases a minister's capacity to survive, with full cabinet members having the lowest <b>hazard</b> <b>rates</b> in our sample. We use different strategies to control for {{the characteristics of the}} government the minister serves in. Our results are robust to any of these controls.

(b) Duration {{dependent}} hazard function [...] A {{key feature}} of the Calvo model is that the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> is constant: the probability of changing the price {{does not depend on}} how old the price is. In 1999, Wolman suggested that the model should be generalized to allow for the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> to vary with the duration. The key idea is that an older price may be more or less likely to change than a newer price, which is captured by the hazard function h(i) which allows the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> to be a function of age i. This generalized Calvo model with duration dependent <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> has been developed by several authors.|$|E

50|$|A key {{assumption}} of the exponential survival function is that the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> is constant. In an example given above, the proportion of men dying each year was constant at 10%, meaning that the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> was constant. The {{assumption of}} constant hazard may not be appropriate. For example, among most living organisms, {{the risk of death}} is greater in old age than in middle age - that is, the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> increases with time. For some diseases, such as breast cancer, the risk of recurrence is lower after 5 years - that is, the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with time.

Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs {{to one or more}} covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the <b>hazard</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, taking a drug may halve one's <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its <b>hazard</b> <b>rate</b> for failure.
