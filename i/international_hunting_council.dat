5000|$|The idea of {{establishing}} {{an international organisation}} dealing with sustainable hunting and wildlife management was first brought up in 1910 at the occasion of an international hunting exhibition in Vienna. The concept was however translated into concrete action in 1928 only, by French lawyer Maxime Ducrocq and Count Louis Károlyi, who organised an international conference in Nové Zámky, Slovakia, in view {{of establishing}} an international hunting organisation. Many of the discussions {{took place in the}} manor of Count Károlyi in Palárikovo, which now serves as the CIC Museum. The conference resulted in the [...] "Declaration of Nové Zámky" [...] calling for the foundation of an <b>international</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>council</b> named [...] "Conseil International de la Chasse" [...] and the formation of a commission which was to work out the Statutes of the CIC. This was the basis for the first general assembly and the official registration of the CIC in November 1930 in Paris.From the beginning, the CIC has promoted ideals for sustainable and ethical hunting, stressing that hunting and the conservation of wildlife go hand in hand, and gaining global recognition as an independent advisor in the field of wildlife conservation.|$|E

Since {{there is a lack}} of consensus among the clients about the efficacy of this method of biodiversity conservation in Africa, a study carried out by the Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund indicates that if Kenya makes trophy hunting legal again, nearly 90% of the clients would be interested to pursue this activity in that country. In this context, the importance of effective regulation of hunting operators and clients has also been highlighted.|$|R

His contribution to the prize-winning British Section of the exhibition was rewarded by a medal presented by Hermann Göring, who had performed the opening ceremony.

His own collection was sufficiently extensive to provide sixty-two of the weapons which he was on hand to demonstrate. It was the largest exhibition of antique firearms ever held in London, and included a drop-down breech-action rifle from 1660 as well as guns made by Joseph Manton, all in working order.|$|R
50|$|Already after World War I, great changes {{began to}} occur in the world of {{taxidermy}} and <b>international</b> <b>hunting.</b> Whereas before 1914 most of the sportsmen seen in the game fields of the world were British, after 1918 they were gradually replaced by American hunters, and after World War II, more American hunters were seen in Africa and Asia than any other nationality. At the same time American taxidermists such as Louis Paul Jonas of Denver, the James Clark Studios, and later Klineburger Brothers Taxidermy started providing taxidermy services to their clientele in the United States. Nonetheless, Rowland Ward Ltd. retained a prominent position in the world of taxidermy, and during the Gerald Best years as much as 80 percent of all taxidermy work was exported out of England.|$|R
