The reduction in yield strength and uniform elongation is compared with literature data from laser heating.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the process parameters for the induction heat treatment have an enormous influence on the resulting component properties like hardness distribution, residual stress distribution and fatigue strength. The selection of optimum hardening parameters via experiments is time-consuming and costly. Powerful hardware and software perform simulation runs for the <b>induction</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treating</b> process to help chose optimal parameters for a particular component. These tools can shorten development cycles and reduce time-consuming and expensive experimental parameter studies. Their potential may {{also be used to}} increase production rates, improve the fatigue properties and define appropriate quantities for quality control. A method to simulate the induction hardening process based on the finite element method is explained and the necessary input quantities are introduced. Various examples illustrate the application of the method. Numerical simulation results are co mpared to experimental data from residual stress measurements (X-ray) and extensive fatigue testing. Appropriate parameters to introduce favorable residual stress distributions depend on component geometry (notches) and type of loading (bending, torsion) among other factors. The numerical simulation of heat treatment processes is an important step towards a meaningful prediction of component behavior and will gain importance for future design processes...|$|E

The microstructure in the semi-solid state consists of fine spheroidal solid grains surrounded by liquid. The results of thixoforming with one step, two-step and three-step <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> regimes are presented. Typical defects in poorly thixoformed material (e. g. liquid segregation, impedance of flow by unrecrystallised grains and porosity) are shown alongside successfully thixoformed material (thixoforming temperature of between 615 and 618 ◦C with a three-step <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> regime).

40|$|One {{application}} for repair welding is {{to restore the}} integrity of a component where a crack has been found. Cracks can appear during in-service or already in the manufacturing process. The latter is usually the case for large castings where cracks may have formed. The repair welding in this entry {{is the process of}} filling a premachined slot. This slot has been milled in order to remove the crack that has been found. The welding process can be any kind of arc, beam, or gas welding process. However, manual arc welding is the most common method for repair welding. Thereafter, the component may need to be <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> in order to reduce residual stresses and/or restore material microstructure. Local heat treatment means that only a part of the structure is <b>heat</b> <b>treated.</b> This is in contrast to global heat treatment where the entire structure is <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> by placing it in a furnace.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presented}} to compare the transmission gear products from SME (UKM gear) and national scale manufacturer (OEM gear) especially on the surface hardening characterization.

The gear product of SME was <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> by pack carburizing and quenching whereas the OEM gear was predicted to be <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> using <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> with high frequency. The surface hardening characterization was conducted by investigating the hardening thickness, the hardness number and the microstructure observation on the gear surfaces. The result of the hardening thickness investigation reveals a distinction on the depth of hardening penetration. The heat treatment using long interval pack carburizing of UKM gear produces a deeper penetration and the higher hardness number on the gear surface whereas the OEM gear has a thin hardness penetration and lower hardness number. The microstructure of the both gears depicts {{the different types of}} phase.
