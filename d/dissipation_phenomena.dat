In the case when the set of equilibria is finite and hyperbolic we show that every trajectory is attracted by some equilibrium with exponential rate. Our arguments involve a recently developed method based on the "compensated" compactness and quasi-stability estimates.

In addition, low loss diaphragm pistons, etched and woven-wire screen heat exchangers, and plastic flexures, as the main components of the system, are outlined. The experimental results are presented and compared with design analysis. Experiments successfully confirm the design models for heat exchanger flow friction losses and gas spring hysteresis dissipation. Furthermore, it is revealed that gas spring hysteresis loss is an important <b>dissipation</b> <b>phenomenon</b> for low-power Stirling engines and should be carefully addressed in design. Analysis shows that the gas hysteresis dissipation is reduced drastically by increasing the number of phases in a multiphase Stirling engine system. It is further shown that for an even number of phases, half of the engine chambers could be eliminated by utilizing a reversing mechanism within the multiphase system. The mathematical formulation and modal analysis of multiphase Stirling engine system are then extended to a system that incorporates a reverser. By introducing a reverser to the fabricated prototype, the system successfully operates in engine mode.
