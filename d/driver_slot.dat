5000|$|Many modern {{electrical}} appliances, if {{they contain}} screws, use screws with heads {{other than the}} typical slotted or Phillips styles. Torx™ is one such pattern that has become widespread. It's a spline tip with a corresponding recess in the screw head. The main cause of this trend is manufacturing efficiency: Torx screwdriver tips do not slip out of the fastener as easily as would a Phillips or <b>slotted</b> <b>driver.</b> (<b>Slotted</b> screws are rarely used in mass-produced devices, since the driver is not inherently centered on the fastener.) ...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 2013 race, {{drainage}} grooves {{were cut}} into the asphalt on the start-finish straight, underneath the first 11 grid <b>slots.</b> <b>Drivers</b> were initially concerned that this would affect grip at the start.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, Bruichladdich Radical {{competed in}} the entire LMS season. Having retired at the opening event, the 1000 km of Monza, the team took a ninth place overall finish and third in class at the 1000 km of Valencia; in the latter race, Greaves and Moseley were joined by Robin Liddell. Following this event, the team participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time, however, Tim Greaves crashed out after 90 minutes, forcing the team to withdraw. The {{following}} LMS race, which was the 1000km of Nürburgring, was little more successful; Greaves and Moseley finished 35th, and ninth in class, after a starter motor problem had cost the team around 30 minutes. A retirement at the 1000 km of Spa followed, due to engine failure after 81 laps, before the season finale, the 1000 km of Silverstone saw the team take 14th overall and seventh in class; Jacob Greaves filling the third <b>driver's</b> <b>slot</b> for the team. The team finished joint-eighth in the LMP2 team's standings; level with Team LNT and Kruse Motorsport on eight points.|$|R

5000|$|... 1978 : Brabham's BT46B 'fan car' deemed {{illegal and}} banned after its first (and only) {{appearance}} of the season where it won at the Swedish Grand Prix, bulkhead behind driver and front roll bar defined, licence qualification criteria set for all <b>drivers,</b> all grid <b>slots</b> allocated 14 metres per car.|$|R
50|$|During the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily, {{small numbers of}} the M1A1 bazooka (using an improved rocket, the M6A1) were used in combat by US forces. The M1A1 accounted for four medium German tanks and a heavy Tiger I, with the latter being knocked out by an improbable hit through the <b>driver's</b> vision <b>slot.</b> A disadvantage to the bazooka was the large backblast, which gave away {{the position of the}} shooter, although all weapons have some firing signature. Moreover, the bazooka fire team often had to expose their bodies in order to obtain a clear field of fire against a target.|$|R

It was previously part of a defensive line on the Bulgarian border. In February 2008 it was ordered recovered by the Bulgarian Defense Minister to be either preserved in a museum in Bulgaria, or sold to a private collector.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} First Nation's gaming in Canada is short but contentious. Only 12 First Nation casinos exist {{scattered}} over five provinces. The Assembly of First Nations view jurisdiction over gaming on First Nation land {{as part of}} their constitutional rights protected by section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However the Supreme Court of Canada has rejected First Nation's claims to a right to conduct gaming activities. Nevertheless, the First Nation casino's largest revenue <b>driver</b> is from <b>slot</b> machine play and the regulation of these is by agreement with an Indigenous Gaming Regulator, a delegated sub-group of each province Gaming Authority.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{unfairness}} of job distribution and the ineffectiveness of break-time assignment among bus drivers are factors identified as problem {{issues in the}} bus driver management in a university campus environment. The issues {{affect the quality of}} the bus service which then pointed to the efficiency or inefficiency of the bus driver scheduling system. Thus, this study investigates the problem and constraints connected to bus driver scheduling activities as a case in a campus environment. Therefore, we developed an efficient bus driver scheduling model based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The GA model is able to schedule efficiently bus <b>drivers</b> to working <b>slots</b> and break in a particular day. It is thus, a time-saving effort and able to satisfy equal break distribution among drivers with overtime work being considered at the same time...|$|R
