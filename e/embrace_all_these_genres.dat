40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to obtain a wideband feeding system compatible with compact wideband antenna geometries with dual polarization properties. These feeding systems are designed according to the antenna performance and their structural nature. Therefore we were encountered with two main problems: first of all investigating new balun configurations which can operate in wideband frequency. In other words, we had to achieve balun configurations presenting good impedance and fields matching in wide frequency bandwidth. Moreover, {{the aim of this}} balun design was to arrive to an integrated structure embracing these two properties- wideband characteristic and dual polarization properties. The second problem was to propose and develop wideband antenna architectures with compact form and conformal design. Also it was desired to have dual polarization abilities. In the designing procedure the main obstacle was that configurations <b>embracing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> properties were rarely proposed in academic researches. In other words in the literature, it was presented rarely an integrated wideband balun connected to compact dual polarized antennas. In this thesis two types of wideband feeding systems are proposed and developed...|$|R

40|$|States {{have the}} right to {{regulate}} access to biological resources subject to national legislations. Allowing, restricting or prohibiting access, however, requires a balance to avoid contravention of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention requires that, in regulating access, the measures adopted do not become a hindrance to access. In many instances, however, this has been the case. Overreaction to previous cases of bio-piracy and over-enthusiasm to tap into the benefits from discovered genetic resources have caused many provider countries to either over-regulate or extremely complicate access procedures, thus deterring access. In some instances, over-regulation and complex procedures are to be blamed on the users’ reluctance to collaborate with providers in minimising or eliminating abuse. Also, the need to protect certain rights over genetic resources or of an intellectual (property) character, for example, might at times complicate regulation. While it is appreciated that such issues must also be taken into account in addressing and creating a balance in access and benefit sharing, a discussion <b>embracing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> aspects cannot be captured within the ambit of this article.

50|$|Although {{the number}} of amateurs {{remained}} high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs {{to take part in}} any given year. The last amateur rider to win the race is Marcus Armytage, who (as of 2016) set the still-standing course record of 8:47.8, when winning on Mr Frisk in 1990. By the 21st century however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as David Campbell who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts.

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} dealing with {{knowledge}} updates differ greatly depending on the underlying knowledge representation formalism. When Classical Logic is used, update operators are typically based on manipulating the knowledge base on the model-theoretic level. On {{the opposite side of}} the spectrum stand the semantics for updating Answer-Set Programs where most approaches need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a unifying perspective that could <b>embrace</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> approaches is of great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and further development. This paper bridges these seemingly irreconcilable approaches to updates. It introduces a novel monotonic characterisation of rules, dubbed RE-models, and shows it to be a more suitable semantic foundation for rule updates than SE-models. A generic framework for defining semantic rule update operators is then proposed. It is based on the idea of viewing a program as the set of sets of RE-models of its rules; updates are performed by introducing additional interpretations to the sets of RE-models of rules in the original program. It is shown that particular instances of the framework are closely related to both belief update principles and traditional approaches to rule updates and enjoy a range of plausible syntactic as well as semantic properties...|$|R
