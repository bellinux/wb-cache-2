These information were analyzed according to official data, like MICROMEDEX® and WHO criteria as well. It was observed that the admission due to drug use occurred in most part of the cases in elderly [47. 5 % (66 / 139) ] and women [62 % (87 / 139) ]. The most frequent drugs used were: omeprazole (16), analgesics (31), antihypertensive (31), simvastatin (7) and formoterol fumarate (6), and the symptoms were normally associated to the digestive (20. 5 %), circulatory (20. 2 %), respiratory (18. 2 %) and central nervous systems (13. 9 %). It was estimated that 15. 5 % (139 / 897) of the hospital admission occurred possibly due to the drug use. The data found by present study suggests some strategies in order to prevent ADR in the context of primary health care services, such as monitoring drug therapy, manly for patients with chronic diseases, elderly and polimedicated people; and pharmaceutical care including dispensation and purchasing of the drugs, a lot of them dispensed over the counter (OTC) ...|$|E
40|$|As Reações Adversas a Medicamentos (RAM) podem ser responsáveis por 2, 4 % a 11, 5 % das admissões {{hospital}}ares. O estudo objetivou conhecer o perfil demográfico dos pacientes internados por possíveis RAM, identificar os medicamentos e as queixas mais freqüentemente relacionadas e estimar a incidência de admissão hospitalar pelo uso de medicamentos. Durante um mês, os pacientes internados em um hospital geral foram entrevistados quanto ao uso de medicamentos antes da internação e as queixas que o levaram ao hospital; as informações foram analisadas, usando-se a base de dados MICROMEDEX® e outras bases oficiais. Observou-se que as admissões por uso de medicamentos ocorreram predominantemente em idosos [47, 5 % (66 / 139) ] e mulheres [62 % (87 / 139) ]. Os medicamentos mais freqüentes foram: omeprazol (16), analgésicos (31), antihipertensivos (31), sinvastatina (7) e formoterol (6); e normalmente os sintomas associados foram do sistema digestório (20, 5 %), circulatório (20, 2 %), respiratório (18, 2 %) e SNC (13, 9 %). Estima-se que em 15, 5 % (139 / 897) das internações, possivelmente, a razão foi o uso de medicamentos. Os dados sugerem medidas de prevenção, como o acompanhamento farmacoterapêutico dos pacientes no âmbito da assistência primária à saúde, principalmente aos idosos, aos portadores de doenças crônicas e aos polimedicados, além da orientação farmacêutica na compra e dispensação de medicamentos, principalmente os isentos de prescrição.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with the problem of designing of a conceptual framework {{for the construction of a}} flexible data warehouse that is adequate for accommodating multi-source data and selecting useful answers to queries, posted to a conflicting community of Patient-Record sources. We put forward a proposal to provide representations with that kind of functionality through flexible reasoning mechanisms for handling perception based descriptions and retrieving <b>intentional</b> <b>answers.</b> We start by positioning conceptual schema, data-warehouses with regard to this problem...|$|R
40|$|We adopt a formalism, {{similar to}} terminological logic {{languages}} developed in AI knowledge representation systems, {{to express the}} semantics of complex objects data models. Two main extensions are proposed with respect to previous proposed models: the conjunction operator, which permits the expression multiple inheritance between types (classes) as a semantic property and the introduction in the schema of derived (classes), similar to views. These extensions, together with the adoption of suitable semantics able for dealing with cyclic descriptions, allow for the automatic placement of classes in a specialization hierarchy. Mapping schemata to nondeterministic finite automata we face and solve interesting problems like detection of emptiness of a classextension and computation of a specialization ordering for the greatest, least and descriptive semantics. As queries can be expressed as derived classes these results also apply to <b>intentional</b> query <b>answering</b> and query validation...|$|R
40|$|We shall {{consider}} a formulation of generalised quantifiers using type theory with records (TTR). TTR follows closely {{the development of}} record types in Martin-Löf or constructive type theory but differs in that the type theory is defined on a classical set theoretic basis. This means that the classical set-theoretic approach to generalised quantifiers can be imported into the type theoretic framework. The result is, I believe, equivalent to the proposal for dynamic generalised quantifiers in Chierchia (1995). The use of dependent types provides us with an elegant approach to the formulation of dynamic quantifiers. We use a notion of hypothetical context which we have used elsewhere to give accounts of <b>intentional</b> identity, <b>answers</b> to questions and information state updates in dialogue management. We suggest that this points towards a general theory of hypothetical context in natural language. We suspect also that our analysis using records will support analyses of commo...|$|R

In this paper, we suggest an approach to executing i* models by translating these into set of interacting agents implemented in the CASO language. In addition, we suggest a hybrid modelling, or co-evolution, approach in which i* models and CASO agent programs are concurrently maintained and updated, while retaining some modicum of loose consistency between the two. This allows us {{to benefit from the}} complementary representational capabilities of the two frameworks...|$|R

Research completed at the Department of Physician Assistant, College of Health ProfessionsThe effects of maternal alcohol use on unborn children have been observed for millennia. These effects include abnormal facial variations, growth retardation, neurological or behavioral problems, decreased cognitive functioning, poor socialization skills, and attention and distractibility problems. Patients may have any degree of symptoms, from mild to severe, or any combination thereof, thus presenting health care providers with the dilemma of correct diagnosis. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the curricula of the Physician Assistant education programs regarding clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol syndrome. Design – Cross sectional, evaluative survey. Participants – all US PA programs. Measurement - A responder from each PA program [either Director or faculty member] will be asked a series of 5 questions concerning knowledge of the disorder, diagnosis and treatment, and adequacy of the training provided. Data Analysis - Data will be analyzed using standard statistical estimates. Results - Analysis should reveal data that can be compared between schools, or saved for future research. Limitations of this study may include inadequate number of responses, unknowledgeable responder, <b>intentional</b> false <b>answering,</b> and/or design error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Extracting {{information}} from semi structured documents {{is a very}} hard task, {{and is going to}} become more and more critical as the amount of digital information available on the internet grows. Indeed, documents are often so large that the dataset returned as answer to a query may be too big to convey interpretable knowledge. In this work we describe an approach based on Tree-based Association Rules (TARs) mined rules, which provide approximate, intentional information on both the structure and the contents of XML documents, and can be stored in XML format as well. This mined knowledge is later used to provide: (i) a concise idea – the gist – of both the structure and the content of the XML document, (ii) quick, approximate answers to queries and (iii) output without redundancy, null tags and empty tag. In this work we focus on the second and third feature. A prototype system and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

5000|$|Interviewers {{should be}} aware that {{applicants}} can fake their responses during the job interview. Such applicant faking can influence interview outcomes when present. One concept related to faking is impression management (IM; when you intend or do not intend to influence how favorably you are seen during interactions). Impression management can be either honest or deceptive. Honest IM tactics are used to frankly describe favorable experiences, achievements and job-related abilities. Deceptive IM tactics are used to embellish or create an ideal image for the job in question. Honest IM tactics such as self-promotion (positively highlighting past achievements and experiences) may be considered necessary by interviewers in the interview context. Consequently, candidates who do not use these tactics may be viewed as disinterested in the job. This can lead to less favorable ratings. Faking can then be defined as [...] "deceptive impression management or the <b>intentional</b> distortion of <b>answers</b> in the interview in order to get better interview ratings and/or otherwise create favorable perceptions". Thus, faking in the employment interview is intentional, deceptive, and aimed at improving perceptions of performance.|$|R
40|$|A project {{presented}} to the Department of Physician Assistant of Wichita State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Physician Assistant. The effects of maternal alcohol use on unborn children have been observed for millennia. These effects include abnormal facial variations, growth retardation, neurological or behavioral problems, decreased cognitive functioning, poor socialization skills, and attention and distractibility problems. Patients may have any degree of symptoms, from mild to severe, or any combination thereof, thus presenting health care providers with the dilemma of correct diagnosis. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the curricula of the Physician Assistant education programs regarding clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment of fetal alcohol syndrome. Design – Cross sectional, evaluative survey. Participants – all US PA programs. Measurement- A responder from each PA program [either Director or faculty member] was asked a series of 5 questions concerning knowledge of the disorder, diagnosis and treatment, and adequacy of the training provided. Data Analysis - Data was collected and analyzed using standard statistical estimates. Results - 69 programs responded to the survey, for a response rate of 51. 1 %. Most PA programs (94 %) believe there is a need for FAS education in PA schools. Although the majority of the programs that responded did so in the affirmative to our questions, the average total time spent talking about FAS in the classroom was only 0. 873 hours. This is likely not enough time to adequately explain all of the subtopics and special issues concerning FAS that were addressed in the survey instrument, and may also indicate that PA students are not getting the quality of education needed to diagnose FAS. Limitations of this study may include inadequate number of responses, unknowledgeable responder, <b>intentional</b> false <b>answering,</b> and/or design error...|$|R
40|$|How can {{we explain}} the {{intentional}} nature of an expert’s actions, performed without immediate and conscious control, relying instead on automatic cognitive processes? How can we {{account for the}} differences and similarities with a novice’s performance of the same actions? Can a naturalist explanation of intentional expert action be in line with a philosophical concept of <b>intentional</b> action? <b>Answering</b> these and related questions in a positive sense, this dissertation develops a three-step argument. Part I considers different methods of explanations in cognitive neuroscience (Bennett & Hacker’s philosophical, conceptual analysis; Marr’s three levels of explanation; Neural Correlates of Consciousness research; mechanistic explanation), defending ‘mechanistic explanation’ as a method that provides the necessary tools for integrating interdisciplinary insights into human action. Furthermore, a dynamic, explanatory mechanism allows {{the assessment of the}} impact of learning and development on expert action in a valuable way that other methods don’t. Part II continues by scrutinizing several cognitive neuroscientific theories of learning and development (neuroconstructivism; dual-processing theories; simulation theory; extended mind/cognition hypothesis), arguing for the complex interactions between different types of processing and different action representations involved in expert action performances. Moreover, according to our discussion of a particular ‘simulation theory’ these interactions can be influenced in several ways with the use of language, allowing an agent to configure a specific action representation for performance at a later stage. The results of Parts I and II are then applied in Part III to a parallel discussion of philosophical analyses of intentional action (discussing i. a. Frankfurt, Bratman, Pacherie and Ricoeur) and cognitive neuroscientific insights in it. Both approaches are found to converge in emphasizing the importance for an expert to develop stable patterns of actions that comply maximally not only with his intentions, but also with his motor expertise and with situational conditions. Consequently, his actions - automatic, or not - rely on this ‘sculpted space of actions’...|$|R
5000|$|Question dodging is the <b>intentional</b> {{avoidance}} of <b>answering</b> a question. This may {{occur when the}} person questioned either does not know the answer and wants to avoid embarrassment, or when the person is being interrogated or questioned in debate, and wants to avoid giving a direct response. [...] Overt question dodging can sometimes be employed humorously, in order to sidestep giving a public answer in a political discussion: when a reporter asked Mayor Richard J. Daley why Hubert Humphrey had lost the state of Illinois in the 1968 presidential election, Daley replied [...] "He lost it because he didn't get enough votes." [...] Often the aim of dodging a question {{is to make it}} seem as though the question was fulfilled, leaving the person who asked the question feeling satisfied with the answer, unaware that the question was not properly answered. A false accusation of question dodging can sometimes be made as a disingenuous tactic in debate, in the informal fallacy of the loaded question. A common way out of this argument is not to answer the question (e.g. with a simple 'yes' or 'no'), but to challenge the assumption behind the question. This can lead the person questioned to be accused of [...] "dodging the question".|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that images have an ontological support by which they obtain an {{independent}} existence from the mind. In accordance with the new theories of aesthetics, we will see that the object of art is taken as an object of thought. Image has an important role in the existence of the work of art; therefore the image becomes an object of thought. To show how the image is independent from the mind or to show how it is not a mind-dependent object, the analysis has to start from the pre-ontological level of the work of art in order to understand the existence of images in correlation with the work of art. At the beginning there is only the object. The object is the work of art before its concretization. It is not nature; it is the natural support of art. From this point of view, the role of the image can be explored in all ontological stages of the work of art. Firstly, it can be argued that the intuition of the artist is the image of the idea underlying the work of art. The intentional image is a subjective image. Secondly, it seems that people can see or have in mind different images (representations) referring to a work of art. This is possible in time and space and implies cultural differences, historical events and so on. A question arises: what supports the <b>intentional</b> image? One <b>answer</b> put forward is that the mind is the support of the image, but it seems that the original intentional image has something that can make other intentional images possible, an infinite number of representations, in other words an infinite number of images. The aim of this paper is to show that we can talk about an original intentional image (the first idea), intentional images (the representations of the work of art in time and space), and the transcendental image which can be defined as the ontological condition for the existence of the intentional image. At the end I will argue that the transcendental image is the support or the entity which offers the ontological conditions necessary for all intentional images.
