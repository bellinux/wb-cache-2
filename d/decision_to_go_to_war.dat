5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced {{by the arrival of}} victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university versus the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. A multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the time taken <b>to</b> make a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> surgery and gender, ethnicity, years in profession, experience of trauma team training, experience of structured trauma courses and trauma in the trauma team, as well as use of closed-loop communication and leadership styles during trauma team training. DESIGN: In situ trauma team training. The patient simulator was preprogrammed to represent a severely injured patient (injury severity score: 25) suffering from hypovolemia due to external trauma. SETTING: An emergency room in an urban Scandinavian level one trauma centre. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 96 participants were divided into 16 trauma teams. Each team consisted of six team members: one surgeon/emergency physician (designated team leader), one anaesthesiologist, one registered nurse anaesthetist, one registered nurse from the emergency department, one enrolled nurse from the emergency department and one enrolled nurse from the operating theatre. PRIMARY OUTCOME: HRs with CIs (95 % CI) for the time taken <b>to</b> make a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> surgery was computed from a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Three variables remained significant in the final model. Closed-loop communication initiated by the team leader increased {{the chance of a}} <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> surgery (HR: 3. 88; CI 1. 02 to 14. 69). Only 8 of the 16 teams made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> surgery within the timeframe of the trauma team training. Conversely, call-outs and closed-loop communication initiated by the team members significantly decreased the chance of a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> surgery, (HR: 0. 82; CI 0. 71 to 0. 96, and HR: 0. 23; CI 0. 08 to 0. 71, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Closed-loop communication initiated by the leader appears to be beneficial for teamwork. In contrast, a high number of call-outs and closed-loop communication initiated by team members might lead to a communication overload. Originally included in thesis in submitted form. </p...|$|R

25|$|An audacious {{plan was}} {{formulated}} whose {{goal was to}} lay siege on the Sassanid capital city of Ctesiphon and definitively secure the eastern border.

25|$|At the time, Zhou Yu was in Poyang Commandery (鄱陽郡; around present-day Poyang County, Jiangxi), so Lu Su advised Sun Quan {{to quickly}} recall Zhou back {{to discuss their}} plans on how to counter Cao Cao's {{impending}} invasion. When Zhou Yu returned, he also urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. This resulted in Sun Quan arriving at his final <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Cao Cao.

25|$|Over 7,000 Canadian {{soldiers}} and support personnel {{were involved in}} the second Boer war from October 1899 to May 1902. With approximately 7,368 soldiers in a combat situation, the conflict became the largest military engagement involving Canadian soldiers from the time of Confederation until the Great War. Eventually, 270 soldiers died {{in the course of the}} Boer War. The Canadian public was initially divided on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> as some citizens did not want Canada to become Britain's 'tool' for engaging in armed conflicts. Many Anglophone citizens were pro-Empire, and wanted the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the British in their conflict. On the other hand, many Francophone citizens felt threatened by the continuation of British Imperialism to their national sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Pei Songzhi, who {{annotated}} Zhou Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi, {{commented that}} Lu Su {{was actually the}} first person who urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. Zhou Yu was at Poyang (鄱陽) before Sun Quan held the discussion with his subjects, and Lu Su suggested to Sun to recall Zhou back for the meeting. Zhou Yu and Lu Su gave similar advice to Sun Quan, which resulted in Sun arriving at his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Cao Cao. Pei felt that it was unfair to Lu Su because Zhou Yu's biography gave full credit to Zhou for being the only person to urge Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao, and failed to mention that Lu Su had already advocated resisting Cao Cao before Zhou Yu did.|$|E

25|$|In late 208, the {{northern}} warlord Cao Cao {{launched a campaign}} aimed at wiping out opposing forces in southern China. He successfully pressured Liu Cong, who had succeeded Liu Biao as the Governor of Jing Province, into surrendering. A few months later, Cao Cao assembled a force of 800,000 at Jiangling (江陵; in present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), where countless warships and weapons were stored, and sent an envoy to intimidate Sun Quan to give up resistance. Sun Quan eventually hardened his <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Cao Cao after Lu Su and Zhou Yu convinced him. He then formed an alliance with another warlord, Liu Bei, to resist Cao Cao.

25|$|The sultan was {{the head}} of state and among his powers and {{responsibilities}} were issuing and enforcing specific legal orders and general rules, making the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> levying taxes for armed campaigns, ensuring the proportionate distribution of food supplies throughout the sultanate and, in some cases, overseeing the investigation and punishment of alleged criminals. A Mamluk sultan or his appointees led the annual Hajj pilgrimage caravans from Cairo and Damascus in the capacity of amir al-hajj (commander of the Hajj caravan). Starting with Qalawun, the Mamluks also monopolized the tradition of providing the annual decorated covering of the Kaaba, in addition to patronizing Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Another prerogative, at least of the early Bahri sultans, was to import as many mamluks as possible into the sultanate, preferring those who originated from the territories of the Mongols. However, the Mamluks' enemies, such as the Mongol powers and their Muslim vassals, the Armenians and the Crusaders, successfully disrupted the flow of mamluks into the sultanate. Unable to meet the military's need for new mamluks, the sultans often resorted to turning Ilkhanid deserters or prisoners of war into soldiers, sometimes while the war the prisoners were captured in was still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Mirabeau {{focused his}} efforts on two main issues: {{changing}} the ministry {{and dealing with}} impending civil war. His attempts to form political alliances with Lafayette and Necker failed and resulted in open hostility. Necker disappeared from the French court after September 1790 and no longer posed a threat. Lafayette, however, was very powerful due to his {{control of the military}} and the National Guard. At first, Mirabeau attempted to undermine Lafayette’s power, but decided {{to solve the problem of}} the ministry, and maintain stability, by removing all ministers and placing the ministry entirely under Lafayette. In effect, Mirabeau suggested that the king distance himself from politics and let the revolution run its course, because it would inevitably destroy itself through its contradictory nature. Furthermore, Mirabeau proposed that, if his plan should fail, Paris should no longer be the capital of France, showing a conservative line of thinking: the only way to end the revolution would be to destroy its place of birth. In a meeting with the king and queen, Mirabeau maintained that not only was civil war inevitable, it was necessary for the survival of the monarchy. Mirabeau believed that the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> even civil war, must come only from the king. In a letter of confidence to Mirabeau, Louis wrote that, as a Christian king, he could not declare war on his own subjects. However, that would not stop him from reacting in kind if his subjects declared war first. In order to avoid provoking a civil war, the king refrained from confronting the Constituent Assembly, and hoped instead for a constitution that he could agree to. Once the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 destroyed this hope, Louis adopted a strategy of strengthening royal authority and the church’s position, and accepted the use of force to accomplish this. Mirabeau's involvement with the court is as interesting for the insights it provides into the mind of Louis XVI as it is for the effects it produced in the Revolution.|$|E

500|$|Tyndall did his {{national}} service in West Germany from 1952 to 1954. A {{member of the}} Royal Horse Artillery, he achieved the rank of lance-bombardier. On completion, he returned to Britain and {{turned his attention to}} political issues. Initially interested in socialism, he attended a world youth festival held in the Soviet Union in 1957. He nevertheless began to regard left-wing politics as being infused with [...] "anti-British attitudes", moving swiftly to the political right. He had a devotion to the preservation of the British Empire and a hostility to what he regarded as the growing permissiveness of British society, stating that [...] "the smell everywhere was one of decadence". During that decade he read Mein Kampf, the autobiography and political manifesto of the late Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, growing sympathetic to Hitler's own political beliefs and Nazism. Tyndall approved in particular of [...] "the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar to what I had observed of the same kinds of forces in Britain." [...] He concluded that Britain's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against Nazi Germany was ultimately the result of a conspiracy headed primarily by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded non-white immigration into Britain after the war.|$|E

[...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E
