40|$|The exact {{vibration}} modes {{and natural}} frequencies of planar structures and mechanisms, comprised Euler-Bernoulli beams, are obtained by solving a transcendental. nonlinear, eigenvalue problem stated by the dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM). To solve {{this kind of}} problem, the most employed technique is the Wittrick-Williams algorithm, developed in the early seventies. By formulating {{a new type of}} eigenvalue problem, which preserves the internal degrees-of-freedom for all members in the model, the present study offers an alternative to the use of this algorithm. The new proposed eigenvalue problem presents no poles, so the roots of the problem can be found by any suitable iterative numerical method. By avoiding a standard formulation for the DSM, the local mode shapes are directly calculated and any extension to the beam theory can be easily incorporated. It is shown that the method here adopted leads to exact solutions, as confirmed by various examples. Extensions of the formulation are also given, where rotary inertia, <b>end</b> <b>release,</b> skewed edges and rigid offsets are all included. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is aimed at}} characterization of the mode of release from two different substitution types of HPMC {{and the effect of}} chemical structure of drugs using the QSPR (Quantitative - Structure Property Relationship) technique. To this <b>end,</b> <b>release</b> profiles of HPMC matrices of several drugs containing the same formulation and compressed at a constant pressure were studied. QSPR method was used to establish statistically significant relationships between release parameters and the structural descriptors. Structural descriptors consisted of molecular mechanical, quantum mechanical and graph-theoretical parameters, as well as the partition coefficient and the aqueous solubility of the drugs. The results showed that the most important factors determining the release profile from both HPMC K 4 M and HPMC E 4 M matrices were the aqueous solubility of drugs (which could be substituted efficiently by dipole moment) {{and the size of the}} drug molecules. Comparison of drug release from matrices prepared using the two grades of HPMC showed very distinct differences for some drugs, as evaluated by the similarity factor. The results indicated that the source of the difference could be sought in the drug properties (as exemplified by the aqueous solubility and surface area) as well as the rate of erosion (that depends mainly on the polymer type) ...|$|E
