5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won {{the right}} to a pension {{following}} a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Living With a War Criminal), which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's {{political}} fortunes, {{and those}} of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by-election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War, but under the first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{under the}} Francoist legislation, a woman needed her husband's {{permission}} {{to take a}} job or open a bank account. Adultery by women was a crime, but adultery by the <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> crime only if he lived with his mistress.|$|E
25|$|After marriage, {{informal}} divorce {{seems to}} have been common and easy. An unhappy wife had only to return to her brother, who was obligated to support her. Adultery was known, as it is in every human society, but was a perilous venture, especially if the cuckolded <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> renowned warrior.|$|E

25|$|Sir Henry Charles Husband (30 October 1908 – 7 October 1983), often {{known as}} H. C. <b>Husband,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> leading British civil and {{consulting}} engineer from Sheffield, England, who designed bridges {{and other major}} civil engineering works. He is particularly known {{for his work on}} the Jodrell Bank radio telescopes; the first of these was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world on its completion in 1957. Other projects he was involved in designing include the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station's aerials, one of the earliest telecobalt radiotherapy units, Sri Lanka's tallest building, and the rebuilding of Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge after a fire. He won the Royal Society's Royal Medal and the Wilhelm Exner Medal.|$|E
25|$|In a less {{scholarly}} treatment, authors Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger {{speculate that}} she had motive to work against the crown but she also had reason not to. British law said that lands could be confiscated if left abandoned, which forced Anna to remain behind when her husband left for Connecticut. For this reason, they suggest, it is possible Anna would not have wanted to risk losing their home. Her children were also with her, so her arrest would have left those children parentless. Additionally, her family was already under close scrutiny since her <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> known dissident. They offer no facts about Strong and her activities in support of these opinions or anything to contradict other sources noted here.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 6, she complained to the police that, after a {{domestic}} dispute, her husband had taken their son from the marital residence, and when the police reached the Randolph house, she told them that her <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cocaine user whose drug use habit had caused the family financial troubles. She mentioned the marital problems, saying that she and their son had only recently returned after a several weeks' stay with her parents. Shortly after the policemen arrived, Scott Randolph returned, explaining to them that he had removed their son to a neighbor's house, worried that his wife might again take the boy out of the U.S.; Scott Randolph denied using cocaine, and countered {{that it was his}} wife, Janet, who used illegal drugs and abused alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Knollys' {{domestic}} affairs at times caused him anxiety. In {{spite of his}} friendly relations with the Earl of Leicester, he did not approve the royal favourite's intrigues with his daughter, Lettice, widow of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and he finally insisted on their marriage at Wanstead on 21 September 1578. The wayward temper of his grandson, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (son of his daughter Lettice by her first <b>husband),</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> source of trouble to him in his later years, and the queen seemed inclined to make him responsible for the youth's vagaries. Knollys was created KG in 1593 and died on 19 July 1596. He was buried at Rotherfield Greys, and an elaborate monument, with effigies of seven sons, six daughters, and his son William's wife, still stands in the church there.|$|E
25|$|She and Giovanni Tadolini {{married on}} 13 April 1827. She was 18 and he 42. The {{following}} year {{she made her}} stage debut in Florence. A brilliant house debut at the Teatro Regio di Parma followed on 29 December 1829 when she sang Giulietta in the theatre's first performance of Nicola Vaccai's Giulietta e Romeo. She appeared there the following year in the theatre's first performances of two Rossini operas – as Amenaide in Tancredi and as Bianca in Bianca e Faliero. Tadolini's <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> close friend and admirer of the composer who was also living in Bologna at the time. In 1830, she sang in a soirée at Rossini's house there, the highlight of which was Rossini himself singing an aria from The Barber of Seville. She also sang Zoraide in Rossini's Ricciardo e Zoraide in its first performance at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris (23 October 1830). Although the Rossinian repertoire (including Rosina in The Barber of Seville) figured primarily in the earliest years of her career, she would later sing the title role in his Armida for a major revival at La Scala in 1836.|$|E
