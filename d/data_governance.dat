When deployed as a managed service, Digital Guardian does not collect the actual data itself. Rather, it aggregates the metadata about the files and documents and watches for patterns of activity. Metadata is encrypted, hashed and digitally signed before being transferred to Digital Guardian's hosting facilities via FIPS 140-2 certified messaging protocol. Digital Guardian then provides updated analytics, alerts and reports. Administrators can continuously monitor data, application and system access and usage, whether end users are online, offline or in virtual environments.

40|$|Water {{governance}} in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) {{is based on}} a historical and complex set of policies, legal decisions, and operational guidelines called the Law of the River. Behind the complex institutional structure lies an intricate web of data on water, most of which are hydrogeological in nature. However, we posit that in order to realise sustainable water governance, management efforts must also address <b>data</b> on water <b>governance.</b> Therefore, our central research question is: {{what is the role of}} water <b>governance</b> <b>data</b> in water <b>governance,</b> as it pertains to agriculture? First, we lay out the digital landscape and theoretical framework that justify the development of the Colorado River Basin Water Governance Relational Database. Then, we conduct an analysis of water-sharing policies within Law of the River to identify and categorise boundaries. By operationalising a boundary typology in a geographic information system, we found that data on agricultural water governance have little to no current role in water governance due to scale discrepancies, insufficient availability and collection of data, and lack of standardisation. In addition, agricultural water {{governance in}} the CRB was found to exhibit polycentric patterns. However, unlike the flexible and adaptive nature of some polycentric systems, polycentric data sets may pose challenges to water governance due to limited information regarding organisational changes, policy developments, and special interests. This study advances the science-policy dialogue in four ways: 1) by emphasising the salience of the <b>data</b> on water <b>governance,</b> 2) by incorporating water <b>governance</b> <b>data</b> in water <b>governance</b> and policy decisions, 3) by demonstrating the value of integrating data types, and 4) by engaging users through geo-visualisation...|$|R

As {{the size of}} the data warehouse increases the value it brings to an organization also increases. However these benefits come at a cost of maintaining the applications and running the data warehouse efficiently on a twenty four by seven basis. Governance is all about bringing discipline and control in place so that application developers and IT integration engineers follow certain guidelines so that the behavior of a data warehouse application becomes predictable and manageable. In this paper we have defined and explained some of the governance best practices being followed in large enterprise data warehouse of an organization. With a <b>data</b> warehouse <b>governance</b> process in place it can help in maintaining a stable data warehouse. <b>Data</b> warehouse <b>governance</b> can support the development life cycle, maintenance, data quality assurance, and the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act requirements and enforce numerous business requirements...|$|R
