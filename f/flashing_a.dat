5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E

Again <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> comic entrance, Sakuraba started the match trading strikes in the {{stand-up}} with the Brazilian specialist. Silva blocked a takedown attempt and delivered knees to the head, but Sakuraba escaped and kept trading strikes, which at the end got him dramatically knocked out. After the fight, {{there was talk of}} Kazushi planning to retire, but nothing came from it.|$|E
500|$|Totti {{was known}} for his exuberant and humorous goal {{celebrations}}. One of his famous celebrations took place on 11 April 1999 in the second Derby della Capitale of the 1998–99 season, in which he scored during the final minutes of the game and celebrated by <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt under his jersey, which read [...] "Vi ho purgato ancora" [...] ("I've purged you guys again"), in reference to events at the previous derby against Lazio on 29 November 1998 when Totti helped Roma come back from 3–1 down with an assist to Eusebio Di Francesco for 3–2 and finally a goal of his own for 3–3. Another derby goal against Lazio saw him take over a sideline camera and aim it at the Roma fans.|$|E
500|$|Around 21:20, Westfalen and {{her sister}} ships began to be engaged by the battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron; several large shells straddled (fell to either side of) the ship and rained {{splinters}} on her deck. Shortly thereafter, two torpedo tracks were spotted {{that turned out to}} be imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Westfalen and Rheinland observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them. During the brief encounter, Westfalen fired seven of her 28cm shells in the span of about two and a half minutes. [...] Westfalen again assumed a position guiding the fleet, this time because Scheer wanted lead ships with greater protection against torpedoes than the pre-dreadnoughts had.|$|E

500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him something. When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom—crowded with young people—erupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada has given me the best Christmas present I ever had", while <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> peace sign.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{much of his}} career, McCain {{was known}} for his short and thin stature, salty character, and {{trademark}} cigar. [...] One superior wrote that: [...] "There is only one Jack McCain! Vice Admiral McCain, by his enthusiasm, honesty and delightful personality makes many friends, not only officially but socially.... The 'little man with the big cigar' is known to everyone." [...] McCain liked to confer with enlisted men and get their opinions. [...] He swore so much he earned the sobriquet [...] "Good Goddamn McCain"; his regular greeting to begin the day was [...] "Good goddamn morning." [...] He was often asked how he told his wife Roberta and her identical twin sister Rowena apart, to which he famously responded by puffing his cigar, <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> grin, and saying, [...] "That's their problem." [...] He jumped rope 200 times a day as part of keeping fit. [...] He developed a problem with alcoholism during his career, and cut back on his drinking so that it did not interfere with his ability to command or show up on fitness reports, although he occasionally suffered lapses.|$|E
500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further sign that {{they were no longer}} the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E

2500|$|Pollster Frank Luntz {{tested the}} phrase {{with a focus}} group in 2001, and {{concluded}} that the only people who really disliked the epithet were highly partisan Democrats. [...] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed modern use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans. Journalist Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it. Marcus stated that disagreements over use of the term are [...] "trivial", and Hertzberg calls use of the term [...] "a minor irritation" [...] and also [...] "the partisan equivalent of <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> gang sign".|$|E
2500|$|In Maryland, police {{officers}} sometimes ticket drivers for flashing car headlights under a law which prohibits driving {{in a vehicle}} with flashing lights and laws prohibiting [...] "obstructing a police investigation". The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland challenges the current interpretation of the law, contending the law refers to an adjective and not a verb; that automatic flashing lights on non-emergency vehicles are illegal, but the act by a driver of manually <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> vehicle's headlamps is not. Though ticketing was common in the 1990s, Maryland and Washington DC police say that flashing one's headlights was not against the law in either place.|$|E

Knowles references Brigitte Bardot when the video cuts to and from shots of Knowles in a men's dress shirt with her hair styled up with a scarf. She also briefly references her film, Dreamgirls, more specifically the latter's inspiration, being Diana Ross, during a few brief scenes in which Knowles wears a short, sparkly dress and bob hairstyle. The clip then sequences from Fame to Flashdance with Knowles and her dancers in another open warehouse-like space sporting the iconic off-the-shoulder look from the 1983 drama starring Jennifer Beals. The video ends with Knowles in a chair, dancing and then <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> smile.|$|E

The event was being broadcast live on Fox Sports Net (FSN), which has a policy against advertising [...]com websites, and Ulliott was banned from appearing in any forthcoming FSN productions. Ulliott later responded that he only paid the entry money so he could advertise his site; it was originally agreed that {{he would be able to}} promote the site, so he decided to advertise his site through the publicity stunt regardless. Despite supporting online poker sites, Ulliott indicated that many online players do not know what they are doing when playing, which makes them harder to play against.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January 1976, {{just after}} 5.30pm, a red Ford Transit minibus was {{carrying}} sixteen textile workers home from their workplace in Glenanne.

As the bus cleared {{the rise of a}} hill, it was stopped by a man in combat uniform standing on the road and <b>flashing</b> <b>a</b> torch. The workers assumed they were being stopped and searched by the British Army. As the bus stopped, eleven gunmen in combat uniform and with blackened faces emerged from the hedges. A man [...] "with a pronounced English accent" [...] began talking. He ordered the workers {{to get out of the}} bus and to line up facing it with their hands on the roof. He then asked [...] "Who is the Catholic?". The only Catholic was Richard Hughes.

However, when Hughes stepped forward the gunman told him to [...] "Get down the road and don't look back".|$|E
