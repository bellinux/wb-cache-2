5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood {{on the verge of}} victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E

Wings returned to Abbey Road in March 1979 to complete the album, before filming a series of promotional videos in Lympne and elsewhere, for what became the Back to the Egg TV special.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} aground <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> {{protected by}} temporary measures organised by Brunel and James Bremner. In August 1847, she was floated free {{at a cost}} of £34,000 and taken back to Liverpool, but this expense exhausted the company's remaining reserves. After languishing at the North Dock for some time, she was sold to Gibbs, Bright & Co., former agents of the Great Western Steamship Company, for a mere £25,000.|$|E

In October of that year, a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place.|$|E

5|$|Word of the {{incidents}} spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States.

He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E

The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference.

In July 1943, they were sent to Port Moresby, New Guinea, where they once again filled the role of garrison troops <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> operating between Buna, Gona and Nassau Bay. In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East, the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming the vanguard of the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before his death, {{which led to}} pneumonia.

He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner {{was out of the}} country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return.

5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held fast <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E
5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated {{is one of their}} greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut, pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1948 Coastal Command {{was also}} {{involved}} in the Berlin Airlift. The Soviet Union attempted to cut off all aid to the city which was jointly occupied by the four major powers, the Soviets in the east, and the Americans, French and British in the west. The joint American-British operation continued <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Coastal Command aircraft were involved as flying boats were the only aircraft with internal anti-corrosion treatment allowing bulk salt to be transported. The Command's operations grew in intensity. By 13 July daily sorties had risen to 16. By October it was 214 sorties (other RAF Commands were also flying in supplies). The flying boats made their flight in using the Elbe river, but these operations {{came to a close}} on 14 December 1948, when the hazard from uncharted sandbanks and wreckage which, in some cases had been deliberately placed there by the Soviets to prevent the Western Allies from supplying the city, made operations impractical. Over 1,000 sorties had been made, and 4,500 tons of supplies were flown in and 1,113 people, mainly children, evacuated.|$|E
