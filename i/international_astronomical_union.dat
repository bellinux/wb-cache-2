5|$|However, Brown {{suspects}} the Spanish team of fraud, {{by using}} Caltech observations {{to make their}} discovery, while the Ortiz team accuses the American team of political interference with the <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> (IAU).

5|$|Some asteroids {{share the}} same names as moons of Saturn: 55 Pandora, 106 Dione, 577 Rhea, 1809 Prometheus, 1810 Epimetheus, and 4450 Pan.

5|$|The first {{standard}} nomenclature for Martian albedo features {{was introduced by}} the <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> (IAU) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named La Planète Mars. The Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies.|$|E

5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> (IAU). The <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
5|$|A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term plutoid {{was adopted by the}} <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature. The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Features on Enceladus {{are named}} by the <b>International</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Union</b> (IAU) after {{characters}} and places from Burton's translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. Impact craters are named after characters, whereas other feature types, such as fossae (long, narrow depressions), dorsa (ridges), planitia (plains), and sulci (long parallel grooves), are named after places. The IAU has officially named 85 features on Enceladus, most recently Samaria Rupes, formerly called Samaria Fossa.|$|E
