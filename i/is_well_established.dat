5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, but it <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> that both genetic and {{environmental}} factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology {{studies have shown that}} the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> {{early on}} {{as not only}} a witness to events, but also as someone who makes {{observations}} and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|In a 1997 {{restaurant}} listing {{published by}} the English-language daily The Jakarta Post, which largely caters to expatriates and middle class Indonesians, at least 80 locations within the city can be considered Chinese out of the 10-page list. Additionally, major hotels generally operate one or two Chinese restaurants, and many more {{can be found in}} large shopping centers. Upscale Chinese restaurants in Jakarta, where the urban character of the ethnic Chinese <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established,</b> can be found serving delicacies such as shark fin soup and bird's nest soup. Food considered to have healing properties, including ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, are in high demand.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E

Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{absolute}} consensus about the adherence of the kings before Darius, such as Cyrus and Cambyses, it <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> that Darius was an adherent of Zoroastrianism {{or at least a}} firm believer in Ahura Mazda. As can be seen at the Behistun Inscription, Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire. Darius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. In many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.|$|E
5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> {{in several other}} {{countries}} as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E

The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy.

5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>established.</b> Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
