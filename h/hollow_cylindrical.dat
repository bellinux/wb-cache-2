25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> bit {{which will}} cut a hole with an annular {{cross-section}} {{and leave the}} inner cylinder of material (the [...] "core") intact, often removing it, is also called a core drill bit or annular cutter. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core drill bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata.|$|E
2500|$|The first trochotrons were {{surrounded}} by a <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> magnet, with poles at the ends. The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten [...] "spade" [...] electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a thick sheet (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was not reversible. A later form of trochotron called a Beam-X Switch replaced the large, heavy external cylindrical magnet with ten small internal metal-alloy rod magnets which also served as electrodes.|$|E

2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E
6000|$|The Instrument {{consisted}} of five Rulers, or long pieces placed [...] together, after the manner exprest {{in the second}} Figure of the first [...] Scheme, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and [...] two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick, [...] {{on the back side}} of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht [...] from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so [...] very firmly fixt; {{in the middle of this}} was made a hole or center, into [...] which one end of a <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> brass Box CC, fashion'd as I [...] shall by and by describe, was plac'd, and could very easily and truly [...] be mov'd to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and [...] moving in, a hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the [...] long Ruler EF, about three foot and three or four inches long, and at [...] three foot from the above mention'd Centers PP was a hole E, cut [...] through, and cross'd with two small threads, and at the end of it was [...] fixt a small sight G, and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm [...] H, with a Screw to fix it in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM [...] was mov'd on the Center B (which was exactly three foot distance from [...] the middle Center P) and a line drawn through the middle of it LM, was [...] divided by a Line of cords into some sixty degrees, and each degree was [...] subdivided into minutes, so that putting the cross of the threads in E [...] upon any part of this divided line, I presently knew what Angle the two [...] Rules AB and EF made with each other, and by turning the Screw in H, I [...] could fix them in any position.

And so by that means, the [...] Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also known. The Brass box [...] CC in the middle was shap'd very much like the Figure X, that is, it [...] was a cylindrical Box stopp'd close at either end, off of which a part [...] both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that the Box, when the [...] Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water when fill'd [...] half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure to be [...] inclin'd to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of [...] Water, and no more, without running over.

The technique requires only one measurement point to obtain information on remote sections that are hundreds of metres apart. Radar equipment sends an electromagnetic wave through an open end of the structure and it receives the backscattered field, which is produced by variations of the internal hollow structure radius (deformations, welding joints, etc.). We derive the link between the recorded signal, which carries information on amplitude and propagation time, the circular anomalies parameters, defined by the percent radial reduction, and the deformation length, avoiding the complications of the most classification algorithms. The anomaly identification is obtained through an inversion procedure that performs well with both the synthetic and real data. In the latter case, the estimated parameters of a given anomaly are in good agreement with the actual ones...|$|R
