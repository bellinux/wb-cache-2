5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
25|$|Considering its poetic roots (Russian literature, bard music), it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{surprise}} that lyrics play a far {{larger role in}} Russian rock than Western rock. Vocal melody is sometimes eschewed {{in favor of a}} more impassioned delivery (Viktor Tsoi, the lead singer of Kino, pioneered a characteristically strained, monotonous style of singing that has been imitated by many).|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} for soil erosion varies throughout the watershed. Erosion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{threat in the}} northwestern part of the watershed, where the land is flat and developed, or in the northeast, dominated by low-erosion soils. In the southeast, soils have a medium risk of erosion, and soils around Powell Butte and the Boring Lava Domes have [...] "an extremely high erodibility factor and are sensitive to ground disturbance".|$|E

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E
500|$|In the February 1991 {{edition of}} Electronic Learning, Robert McCarthy wrote: [...] "Teachers, {{educational}} administrators and software developers are {{enthusiastic about the}} new, lower cost Apple Macintosh computers". Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at MECC, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: [...] " [...] is terrific – both because it's a Mac {{and because of that}} low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh." [...] Scholastic, an educational software developer, was also confident of Apple's ability to compete with MS-DOS machines, stating: [...] "They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort-level." [...] Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: [...] "we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> issue." [...] Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic {{because of the lack of}} a color monitor, an option which the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular Apple IIe Card also increased the LC's appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million).|$|E
500|$|However, Daniel House, {{who owned}} C/Z Records, disputed these {{perceptions}} in 1994. House stated {{that there was}} [...] "...no more (heroin) here [...] than anyplace else"; he stated that the [...] "heroin <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of the [...] culture", and that [...] "marijuana and alcohol...are far more prevalent". Jeff Gilbert, one of the editors of Guitar World magazine, stated in 1994 that the media association of the Seattle grunge scene with heroin was [...] "really overblown"; instead, he says that Seattle musicians were [...] "...all a bunch of potheads." [...] Gil Troy's history of America in the 1990s states that in the Seattle grunge scene, the [...] "...drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine [...] to blue-collar marijuana." [...] Rolling Stone magazine reported that members of Seattle's grunge scene were [...] "coffee-crazed" [...] by day on espresso and [...] "...by night, they quaff oceans of beer – jolted by Java and looped with liquor, no wonder the [...] music sounds like it does." [...] "Some [...] scene veterans maintain that MDA", a drug related to Ecstasy, [...] "was a vital contributor to grunge", because it gave users a [...] "body high" [...] (in contrast to marijuana's [...] "head high") that made them appreciate [...] "bass-heavy grooves". Pat Long's [...] History of the NME states that scene members involved with the Sub Pop label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls Ecstasy's [...] "warm glow" [...] had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.|$|E

After promotion of this album ended, Tikaram was let go of Mother records and retired from the music scene for several years.|$|R
2500|$|The {{lead-acid}} battery is still used today in automobiles and other applications where weight <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> factor. The basic principle {{has not changed}} since 1859. In the early 1930s, a gel electrolyte (instead of a liquid) produced by adding silica to a charged cell {{was used in the}} LT battery of portable vacuum-tube radios. In the 1970s, [...] "sealed" [...] versions became common (commonly known as a [...] "gel cell" [...] or [...] "SLA"), allowing the battery to be used in different positions without failure or leakage.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{interesting}} wildlife of St. John is located {{beneath the surface of}} the ocean. Gibney Beach <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> attraction for snorkelers because much of the marine life off Gibney Beach was significantly damaged during a heavy rain during the excavation for the Myrah Keating Smith Clinic. [...] Soil was washed down into the bay and resulted in turbidity that damaged much of the coral life in the bay. [...] The coral reefs are slowly coming back to life bringing more animal marine life with them.|$|E
2500|$|Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) cosponsored {{and spoke}} {{on behalf of}} an {{amendment}} that would have inserted strong network neutrality mandates into the bill. In between speeches by Snowe and Dorgan, Stevens gave a vehement 11-minute speech using colorful language to explain {{his opposition to the}} amendment. Stevens referred to the Internet as [...] "not a big truck," [...] but a [...] "series of tubes" [...] that could be clogged with information. Stevens also confused the terms Internet and e-mail. Soon after, Stevens's interpretation of how the Internet works became a topic of amusement and ridicule in the blogosphere. The phrases [...] "the Internet <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> truck" [...] and [...] "series of tubes" [...] became internet memes and were prominently featured on U.S. television shows including Comedy Central's The Daily Show.|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5million ($million in [...] dollars) contract, {{which was}} {{believed}} to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for National Basketball Association player Magic Johnson. DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received {{from the rest of the}} hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with." [...] As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, [...] "It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years." ...|$|E

60|$|And it was peace. We {{learned the}} glad news {{when we had}} risen {{alongside}} the Juno, and the ringing cheers which greeted us had at last died away. Our orders were to report ourselves at once at Blankenberg. Then she passed on down Channel to collect the others. We returned to port upon the surface, steaming through the whole British fleet as we passed up the North Sea. The crews clustered thick {{along the sides of}} the vessels to watch us. I can see now their sullen, angry faces. Many shook their fists and cursed us as we went by. It was not that we had damaged them--I will do them the justice to say that the English, as the old Boer War has proved, bear no resentment against a brave enemy--but that they thought us cowardly to attack merchant ships and avoid the warships. It is like the Arabs who think that a flank attack is a mean, unmanly device. War <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> game, my English friends. It is a desperate business to gain the upper hand, and one must use one's brain in order to find the weak spot of one's enemy. It is not fair to blame me if I have found yours. It was my duty. Perhaps those officers and sailors who scowled at the little Iota that May morning have by this time done me justice when the first bitterness of undeserved defeat was passed.|$|E

5000|$|It's a Bird...It's <b>a</b> Plane...It's Superman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit, but [...] "You've Got Possibilities", {{generally}} considered the show's most memorable tune, became {{something of a}} cabaret standard.|$|R
