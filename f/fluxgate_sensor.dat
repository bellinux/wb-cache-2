40|$|Abstract. Characterization of {{magnetic}} material embedded in soil subsurface using portable controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) methods requires {{a source of}} continuous signal having frequency more than 1 kHz. This signal is generated by the function generator whose output is amplified by a power amplifier. Alternating current (AC) output of the power amplifier can be varied from 0. 10 A – 0. 45 A at frequency of 5 kHz. To generate AC magnetic field, {{the output of the}} power amplifier is then connected to the solenoid coil with ferrite core which has 130 turns of wire and diameter of 3 cm. The AC magnetic field was detected by a <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensor</b> with high sensitivity (568 mV/µT or 1. 76 nT/mV). In order to work at higher frequencies, the excitation and phase-frequency detector is adjusted in the electronic circuit of the <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensor.</b> The signal processing circuits of the <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensor</b> utilize the 2 nd-order of Butterworth filter with cut-off frequency of 10. 6 kHz. By this method, the <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensor</b> can detect frequency of AC magnetic field up to 10 kHz. The output voltage of this sensor has a maximum measurement range of 0. 23 – 2. 95 V at 5 kHz. The results indicate the effectiveness of the <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensor</b> in detecting AC magnetic field emitted by magnetic material embedded in soil subsurface...|$|E

In addition, the relationship between the sensing properties and the magnetization process of its core was investigated with a Kerr microscope.

Highly magnetostrictive amorphous ribbons exhibited maze domains that were difficult to move by applying a low magnetic field of a few hundred amperes per meter.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of two different}} kinds of <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors</b> that employ magnetic cores made of amorphous Fe 77. 5 Si 7. 5 B 15 wires is presented in this work. In the first kind, the high axial anisotropy of the aforementioned wires is utilized for signal extraction. In the latter kind, the Matteucci effect observed in Fe 77. 5 Si 7. 5 B 15 wires is employed, {{without the use of}} a secondary coil. It is well known that the sensitivity of second-order-harmonic <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors</b> is inversely proportional to the magnetic core cross-section. For this reason, amorphous wires, especially glass-covered ones, are being rarely used as magnetic cores in conventional <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors.</b> For compensating this disadvantage a novel signal extraction technique is employed, instead of the second-order-harmonic one, that makes sensor response independent from core cross-section, hysteresis loop shape and excitation frequency. For the noise {{performance of}} the <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors</b> to be optimized, the repeatability of axial B-z-H. and circumferential B -H-z hysteresis loops provided by 125 m, conventional and 40 in, glass-covered wires are quantitatively and qualitatively verified. Great attention is paid to the repeatability of B -H-z loops provided by wire-samples, excited with magnetic field waveforms of different frequency and amplitude and subjected to different torsion levels, or subjected to prior torsion-annealing. The Matteucci effect is well respected, because its employment offers the possibility for constructing miniature sensors. The influence of temperature increase in hysteresis loop repeatability is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|As a {{continuation}} of Part I this paper is devoted to <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors</b> that employ Fe 77. 5 Si 7. 5 B 15 amorphous wires as magnetic cores, with attention being paid to fluxgate miniaturization. Two types of <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors</b> have been constructed. The first type {{is based on the}} high axial anisotropy exhibited by amorphous wires and employs two coils, an excitation and a receiving one. The second type employs the large Matteucci effect, owed to helical anisotropy induced into such wires either by mounting under torsion or by torsion annealing. The latter fluxgate type employs one single excitation coil. The exploitation of the Matteucci effect indicates that it may lead to the construction of miniature <b>fluxgate</b> <b>sensors.</b> The voltage-output of a series of such sensors has been sampled and processed. The repeatability of the flux-reversal process in the presence of helical or axial anisotropy is quantitative and qualitative investigated to allow for understanding the nature of noise. The existence of noise-sources that have been modeled in Part I is investigated and their power spectral density is estimated, from the experimental results. The influence of several manufacturing parameters in the noise at the output of <b>fluxgates</b> <b>sensors</b> is experimentally verified. Such parameters are the dimensions of the core, the presence and thickness of the glass-cover in glass-covered wires, the level of applied stress and torsion, working temperature level, and the characteristics of the excitation waveform. An irregular behavior at the hysteresis loop of fluxgates that employ the Matteucci effect is observed, which could be understood as a kind of perming effect. Measurements of the repeatability and hysteresis errors, of the sensors transfer function (output-voltage vs input-field), are presented, along with measurements of the cross-field sensitivity. The latter errors do not count as noise, but may limit the performance of fluxgates significantly, especially when miniaturization is attempted. Finally some design rules and manufacturing hints are proposed for fluxgate-magnetometer noise reduction...|$|R
