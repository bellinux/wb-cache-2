25|$|Following his {{re-election}} as president in 1961, Hoffa worked {{to expand the}} union. In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in North America under a single National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement,</b> in {{what may have been}} his finest achievement in a lifetime of union activity. He then tried to bring the airline workers and other transport employees into the union, with limited success. During this period, he was facing immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching appeals of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} on the freight industry and the national <b>freight</b> <b>agreement</b> continued, however. By {{the end of the}} 1990s the National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which had covered 500,000 drivers in the late 1970s, dropped to fewer than 200,000, with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas.|$|E

50|$|The National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> is an {{occasionally}} updated master contract concerning {{employment of}} teamsters {{that has been}} signed by numerous labor unions and employers in the United States. Its original version was negotiated in the early 1960s by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.|$|E
5000|$|Williams' successor, Jackie Presser, was {{prepared}} to grant most of these concessions {{in the form of}} a special freight [...] "relief rider" [...] that would cut wages by up to 35 percent and establish two-tier wages. Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which had grown out of efforts to reject the 1976 <b>freight</b> <b>agreement,</b> launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider, which was defeated by a vote of 94,086 to 13,082.|$|E
50|$|A forward <b>freight</b> <b>agreement</b> (FFA) is a {{financial}} forward contract that allows ship owners, charterers and speculators to hedge against {{the volatility of}} freight rates. It gives the contract owner {{the right to buy}} and sell the price of freight for future dates. FFAs are built on an index composed of a shipping route for tanker or a basket of routes for dry bulk, contracts are traded ‘over the counter’ on a principal-to-principal basis and can be cleared through a clearing house.|$|E

Imarex {{is owned by}} Imarex ASA (formerly known as Imarex NOS) and has subsidiaries in Oslo, Singapore, Genova and Houston (USA).|$|R
5000|$|A new {{contract}} for 65,000 drivers {{working under the}} Teamsters National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> was reached in February 2003. The contract restored the union's right to strike {{when there was a}} deadlock over grievances, a right given up under a previous contract of 1994. [...] "The nation is in the depths of recession and on the brink of war, and we maintained our strong health care benefits, protected our pensions and won the highest wage increases in more than a decade," [...] said Teamsters president James Hoffa.|$|E
5000|$|Freight derivatives, which {{includes}} Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> (FFA), container freight swap agreements, container freight derivatives, physical-deliverable freight derivatives, and options based on these, are financial instruments for trading in future levels of freight rates, for dry bulk carriers, tankers and containerships. These instruments are settled against various freight rate indices {{published by the}} Baltic Exchange (for Dry and most Wet contracts), Shanghai Shipping Exchange (International and domestic Dry Bulk, and International Containers), and Platt's (Asian Wet contracts), or physical delivered through Shanghai Shipping Freight Exchange.|$|E
50|$|At Shippers and Preston, Paff {{connected}} with {{rank and file}} workers across the Midwest who had been active in previous Teamster efforts such as Teamsters United Rank and File (TURF), and he got involved with starting a new Teamster reform organization. It was initially called Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC), since it was organized around mobilizing for the 1976 National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> negotiations. At their founding convention at Kent State University outside of Cleveland in September 1976, TDC formally changed their name to Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate if the Baltic Capesize Index is a good proxy for actual Capesize earnings and why they deviate. The results may implicate if forward <b>freight</b> <b>agreements</b> are suitable for revenue management in practice. This because forward <b>freight</b> <b>agreements</b> are bought and held through maturity, and by definition, forward prices will converge to spot prices as they reach maturity. What matters is therefore the difference between spot index and actual earnings. The dissertation {{is based on a}} simulation approach where both single linear regression and the dollar-offset method are used to evaluate how good proxy the Baltic Capesize Index is. Our findings indicate that actual earnings are most affected by the basis risks geography and timing, and the “lag” before changed market conditions are reflected in actual earnings. Linear regression and the dollar-offset method are ambiguous whether the Baltic Capesize Index is a good proxy for actual Capesize earnings. To conclude whether the Baltic Capesize Index is a good proxy it is therefore necessary to conduct more research on which methods that are appropriate within shipping...|$|R

40|$|Cross market {{linkages}} and spillover effects between Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreements</b> (FFAs) and futures contracts on {{the commodities}} transported by Panamax vessels can aid {{decision making in}} the very volatile freight markets. Results indicate that there are significant spillover effects between freight and commodity derivatives markets. These relationships run stronger from the commodity futures markets to forward freight markets. Following these results, market participants may monitor changes in the futures markets of the commodities transported by Panamax vessels to enhance their decisions in FFA and spot markets. ...|$|R

50|$|Hoffa {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement, the National Master <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement,</b> in 1964. Hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement, which authorized selective strikes against particular employers, to police the agreement or, if Hoffa thought that it served the union's interest, to drive marginal employers out of the industry. The union won substantial gains for its members, fostering a nostalgic image of the Hoffa era as the golden age for Teamster drivers. Hoffa also succeeded where Tobin had failed, concentrating power at the international level, dominating the conferences which Beck and Dobbs had helped build.|$|E
5000|$|Horvitz {{played an}} active role in {{negotiating}} a new master <b>freight</b> <b>agreement</b> between the trucking industry and the Teamsters, ending a 10-day strike and lockout that had 300,000 drivers and other union employees out of work. As part of the agreement reached in April 1979, workers received an additional $1.50 per hour, with wages and benefits rising 30% in the three years of the contract. Horvitz served as mediator from the start of negotiations and praised both sides for resisting internal and external pressures to prolong the work stoppage. Later that year, Horvitz also played a direct role in [...] "very difficult and complicated" [...] negotiations towards reaching an agreement to end a 12-week-long strike by grain handlers the 600 workers represented by Local 118 of the American Federation of Grain Millers that brought an estimated $1 billion in losses to the farmer industry in the Upper Midwest.|$|E

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} {{of shipping}} freight rates (freight rate risk) {{is an important}} source of market risk for all participants in the freight markets including hedge funds, commodity and energy producers. We measure the freight rate risk by the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach. A range of parametric and non-parametric VaR methods is applied to various popular freight markets for dry and wet cargoes. Backtesting is conducted in two stages by means of statistical tests and a subjective loss function that uses the Expected Shortfall, respectively. We find that the simplest non-parametric methods should be used to measure freight rate risk. In addition, freight rate risk is greater in the wet cargoes markets. The margins in the growing freight derivatives markets should be set accordingly.

There are five clearing houses for freight: NOS Clearing/NASDAQ OMX, LCH.Clearnet, CME Clearport, ICE Futures Europe and SGX, and one electronic exchange: Shanghai Shipping Freight Exchange. Freight derivatives are primarily used by shipowners and operators, oil companies, trading companies, and grain houses as tools for managing freight rate risk. Recently, with commodities standing at the forefront of international economics, the large financial trading houses, including banks and hedge funds, have entered the market.|$|E
50|$|One year {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of this new lease with Norfolk Southern, in 1998, the State of North Carolina agreed to buy out the remaining 25% private shares of NCRR stock, making it a privately run company, with the voting stock fully owned by the state. In 2000, the General Assembly established by statute that North Carolina Railroad Company revenues are to be used for improvements to the NCRR line. A year later, the implementation of a Corridor Improvement Program that serves as the blueprint for upgrading the railroad was put into place and the first projects, $10 million worth of improvements along the corridor between Goldsboro and Morehead City, were completed. That same year the North Carolina Railroad Company approved a contract with Norfolk Southern and the North Carolina Department of Transportation to complete $30 million of improvements that would eliminate 20 minutes of daily passenger travel time between Raleigh and Charlotte in a double tracking project near Greensboro. NCRR's corporate capital improvement program is funded from NCRR capital funds generated through its <b>freight</b> <b>agreement</b> with Norfolk Southern. NCRR does not receive any state appropriations, and its properties are subject to North Carolina city and county property taxes, most but not all of which are paid by Norfolk Southern under the agreements.|$|E

40|$|Physical time-charters (TC) and Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreements</b> (FFAs) {{represent}} two hedging {{approaches that}} differ {{in terms of}} risks and physical access to transportation. We investigate the determinants of the time-varying TC-FFA freight rate differential in a linear regression framework. We find that TC rates and FFA prices are co-integrated but that TC rates are generally priced higher than FFAs, with the differential explained by the level and slope of the term structure as well as vessel specifications and contractual terms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we set up}} the {{theoretical}} framework for the valuation of the Asian-style options traded in the freight derivatives market. Assuming lognormal spot freight dynamics, we show that Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreements</b> (FFA) are also lognormal prior to the settlement period, but that this lognormality subsequently breaks down. We suggest approximate dynamics in the settlement period for the FFA that leads to closed-form option pricing formulas for Asian call and put options written on the spot freight rate indices in the Black (1976) framework. In a Monte Carlo experiment we show that our formula gives very accurate prices, in particular for forward-starting freight options...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the volatility of forward contract price during different phases and holding periods in dry bulk shipping market, which could be helpful for the hedging and portfolio on the shipping market. This paper applies the Stochastic Volatility model to analyze the volatility, and the parameters of the model are estimated via the software package of Bayesian inference using Gibbbs sampling. The empirical results based on the daily price of Panamax forward <b>freight</b> <b>agreement</b> from 3 Jan 2006 to 13 Aus 2010 suggest that there are different stabilities, volatility persistence and trading active degrees in different conditions...|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{investigates the}} unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} of Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> (FFA) {{prices in the}} freight over-the-counter (OTC) forward market trades. Cointegration techniques are employed to examine the hypothesis. The results indicate that: FFA prices one and two months before maturity are unbiased predictors of the realised spot freight rates for all investigated shipping routes; three months FFA prices for panamax Pacific routes are unbiased predictors of spot prices, while FFA prices for panamax Atlantic routes {{are found to be}} biased predictors of spot prices. This diverse evidence suggests that the validity of the unbiasedness hypothesis depends on the specific characteristics of the market under investigation, the selected trading route and the time to maturity of the contract.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the introduction of Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreement</b> (FFA) trading on spot market price volatility in two panamax Atlantic (1 and 1 A) and two panamax Pacific (2 and 2 A) trading routes of the dry-bulk shipping industry. The results suggest that the onset of FFA trading: (a) decreased spot price volatility in all investigated routes, (b) has had an impact on the asymmetry of volatility in Pacific routes, and (c) substantially improved the quality and speed of information flow in three out of the four investigated routes. After introducing control variables, that may affect price volatility, the results indicate that only in voyage routes may the reduction in volatility be a direct consequence of FFA trading. It seems that the introduction of FFA trading has not had a detrimental effect on the spot market, with an improvement in the way information is transmitted into spot prices following the onset of FFA trading.

40|$|Quantitative market timing {{strategies}} have been traditionally tested in liquid commodity and financial futures, often {{with mixed results}} {{with respect to their}} performance. We extend this methodology to a non-storable commodity, freight, where hitherto this analysis has not been carried out. The freight futures market is mature and increasingly liquid, making it a good case for diversification and trading opportunities. We carry out a comprehensive study of quantitative trading strategies in the FFA (Forward <b>Freight</b> <b>Agreements)</b> market {{on a wide variety of}} contracts and maturities with a number of trading rules. We find that in spite of robustness checks, trading rules do outperform the buy-and-hold benchmark in general. We also explore the possibility that illiquidity and a small sample size may impact the results of the tests and therefore offer an intuitive approach to mitigate their effects. A procedure that augments the Hansen (2005) SPA (Superior Predictive Ability) methodology and allows us to use it for smaller sample sizes with increased confidence is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} spillovers in the Capesize forward <b>freight</b> <b>agreements</b> (FFAs) markets {{before and after the}} global financial crisis. The paper chooses four Capesize voyage routes FFAs (C 3, C 4, C 5, and C 7), two time-charter routes FFAs (BCIT/C average, BPI T/C average), and spot rates as research subjects, covering the periods 3 January 2006 to 24 December 2015. This paper applies Volatility Spillover Multivariate Stochastic Volatility (VS-MSV) model to analyze volatility spillover effects and estimates the parameters via software of Bayesian inference using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS), the deviance information criterion (DIC) used for goodness-of-fit model. The results suggest that there are volatility spillover effects in certain Capesize FFAs routes, and the effects from spot rates to FFAs take place before crisis, yet they are bilateral after crisis. With the development of shipping markets, the correlations between FFAs and spot rate are enhanced, and it seems that the effects depend on market information and traders’ behavior. So practitioners could make decisions according to the spillovers...|$|R
