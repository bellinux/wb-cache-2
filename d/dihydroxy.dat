2500|$|Today, {{hydrogen}} peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939.

Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the derivatized anthracene, whereby the oxygen present in the air reacts with the labile hydrogen atoms (of the hydroxy groups), giving hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone.
