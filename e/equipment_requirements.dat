5|$|With the Norwegian {{operation}} requirements {{drawn up}} for a coastal reconnaissance floatplane, a series of modifications were requested to the original design. The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks. Additional armament changes led {{to a combination of}} six machine guns replacing the four machine gun (two fixed forward, two flexible rear-mounted 7.9mm)/one cannon (forward facing, fixed 20mm) arrangement that was in the initial design. Provision for a rear under-fuselage gun was also made. Further <b>equipment</b> <b>requirements</b> including fitting a rear fuselage-mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment.|$|E

25|$|Upon its {{formation}} the 1st Armoured Division was organised along British {{lines and}} was authorised six armoured regiments and an armoured car regiment. While these regiments began forming in mid-1941 {{they were not}} issued with any tanks as it was planned to equip the division and finalise its training when it deployed to the Middle East between December 1941 and March 1942. Following the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific {{the decision was made to}} retain the division in Australia. At this stage, there were still not enough tanks available to complete the division's <b>equipment</b> <b>requirements,</b> and so as an interim solution the division's armoured regiments were equipped with Bren Carriers until sufficient tanks arrived. These were replaced by newly arrived M3 Grant medium tanks in April and May 1942, and the division completed its training in northern New South Wales, before moving to Western Australia in 1943 where it was tasked with defending against a possible Japanese invasion.|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, UN {{officials}} {{claimed that}} the $7.1 billion budget (USD) for peacekeeping troops was insufficient even before planned reinforcements of MONUC could be fulfilled; even the troop and <b>equipment</b> <b>requirements</b> may not be met, as Western countries declined support, citing the conflict not as [...] "strategically vital" [...] as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. International Crisis Group vice-president Fabienne Hara stated that, [...] "Contributions of U.N. members states will probably not grow at the very least, if not diminish... may not be funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources." [...] An anonymous UN official {{claimed that the}} Security Council could [...] "drop the ball, {{move on to another}} issue and we're the ones at fault. We've seen before that is a recipe for failure." [...] Reuters reported that a senior Western Security Council diplomat claimed that, while criticism was not invalid, other countries with reserves of troops should aid failing peacekeeping missions. The official stated that [...] "We're not the only ones who can do this. Where are the Russians, the Ukrainians? Where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the Security Council? Where is Brazil? It doesn't always have to be us." [...] The lack of peacekeeping resources was cited as counterproductive by political analyst Max Bergmann of the National Security Network. [...] "UN forces ... do fail, but this is often the result of either too few troops or too little money. Our reliance on the United Nations to address trouble spots and to prevent them from worsening has only increased. Shorting the U.N. on peacekeeping funding is therefore akin to shooting ourselves in the foot." [...] European Union nations declined to intervene.|$|E

They help people to deal with a large amount of work, especially operate in the extremely dangerous environment instead of people. For a robot, effective obstacle avoidance is still a challenge in {{the development}} of robot. The existing systems sometimes combine with multi-devices to conquer this challenge so that the expensive cost has been as a negative factor that cumbers the application of robot. For this purpose, find a way with the low <b>equipment</b> <b>requirement</b> but still having the high accuracy is essential. Optic flow as another algorithm coming from bee vision has been used to help robots avoid obstacles for many years. And it owns many advantages. This study presents a system based on the optic flow is developed to avoid obstacle in the view-field of the robot. The main point in this thesis is to show how the system works under an assumed environment for robot navigation, and compare the results to Thomas’ to see whether the low <b>equipment</b> <b>requirement</b> can also achieve the purpose of avoiding obstacles...|$|R
