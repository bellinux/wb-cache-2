500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, come now!" [...] he exclaimed, laughingly, and {{apparently}} {{not the least}} out of countenance, [...] "you made him think {{he was the only}} pebble on the beach. I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were talking about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wasn't that a--a fine {{thing for}} you to do?" [...] she demanded, furiously. And with the {{outburst}} she felt her face blazing. [...] "If I'd any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> meant--you couldn't--have driven me!... I trusted you. And you sent me down there on some--shameful errand of yours. You're no gentleman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{thinking}} of throwing you over, but I don't even know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. There {{seem to be}} no end of things I can't do. Hadn't you better tell me of something that I could do? Have <b>you</b> any <b>idea</b> yourself <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want from me?" ...|$|R

The next step is to capture the data from the contracts.|$|R

6000|$|... "All right. We {{understand}} each other. Reckon there won't be any call for such extremes. I haven't an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean--what can be done. But I say, go slow, so we won't all find graves. First cheer her up somehow. Make {{her want to}} live. But go slow, John. AND DON'T BE WITH HER LATE!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{began the}} elder {{lady in a}} high key, [...] "after all this worry and trouble you have given us, James, haven't you {{anything}} to say? Do you know--have you the least <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing? what egregious folly you are committing? what everybody is saying? Eh? Heavens and earth!--do you know who I am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this sounds}} like great {{nonsense}} to me," [...] said Eric restlessly. [...] "I suppose you have an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are talking about, but I haven't. And, in any case, it practically {{means that there is}} no hope for her--or me. Even if your theory is correct it is not likely such an occasion as you speak of will ever arise.

6000|$|She {{laughed at}} me outright. [...] "And is this the first moment that that {{difficulty}} has occurred to you?" [...] she asked, gaily.

6000|$|... "I hope not, Julia, indeed!" [...] He {{paused a}} moment, still {{with his face}} toward her and his elbows on his knees; then he pursued: [...] "You're a very {{accomplished}} woman and a very zealous one; but you haven't an idea, you know--not to call an <b>idea.</b> <b>What</b> <b>you</b> mainly want is {{to be at the}} head of a political salon; to start one, to keep it up, to make it a success." ...|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "everything" [...] clearly struck him--to {{the point}} even of {{determining}} {{the tone of his}} reply. [...] "Far from it. How can you ask that when I refuse what you tell me you came to offer? Make of my <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can; I think I've sufficiently expressed it, and it's at any rate to take or to leave. It's the only one, I may nevertheless add; it's the basket with all my eggs. It's my conception, in short, of your duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hated to}} go and leave you there," [...] she said. [...] "I waited about behind those thick {{blackthorn}} trees, hoping that you might come my way. I saw you creep up to the gun. I saw you raise it to your shoulder. Even then I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were going to do. Afterwards I saw the smoke and the flash. I heard the report, and Mr. Rochester's cry as he fell. I saw you slip a fresh cartridge into the gun, and go stealing away. Bertrand, I have not slept since. Tell me, was it a nightmare?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{must say}} more about it," [...] he replied. [...] "I repeat I have no <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are talking about. I have no secret {{whatever}} on my mind. By your manner {{it must be}} something serious, and I think I {{have a right to}} know what it is." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{conversation}} in the parlour (from eight to eleven) is often remarkably brilliant, and I often wish that you, {{or some of the}} Bangor folks, could be there to enjoy it.

I sometimes think that at Bangor they don't express enough (but it seems as if over there, there was less to express). It seems as if; at Bangor, there were things that folks never tried to say; but here, I have learned from studying French that you have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can say, before you try. At Bangor they seem to give it up beforehand; they don't make any effort. (I don't say this in the least for William Platt, in particular.) ...|$|E
