500|$|There were {{lines and}} {{fragments}} that were discarded {{in the course}} of the production of Murder in the Cathedral. 'Can't get them over on the stage,' said the producer, and <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> bowed to his judgment. However, these fragments stayed in my mind, and gradually I saw a poem shaping itself round them: in the end it came out as 'Burnt Norton.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, an American {{educator}} and Unitarian minister, wrote a poem titled [...] "Nunc dimittis". [...] Written {{a few months}} before his death (and two years before T.S. Eliot's birth,) the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, [...] "When may <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?" [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] has been seen by the Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, as a tacit tribute by Eliot to his grandfather, [...] "for the last years of a grandfather whose faith his grandson has at last taken up for himself".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{historical}} connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged {{not at the}} Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the Shaftesbury) Theatre (1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and Sadler's Wells (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948). [...] His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929–30, 1932–33, and 1941.

During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, [...] "If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> suggest to the New Deal that it cancel England's war debt {{in exchange for the}} D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer." ...|$|E

About this period Shearing wrote:"It {{is impossible to}} imagine a more compatible musical partner... <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances. As Mel put it, we were two bodies of one musical mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tennyson was {{not quite}} finished. [...] "Now, Jack, a final letter. To the Hon. L H Tennyson, captain, Hampshire County CC, Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire. `Dear Skipper, <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> regret my behaviour, and so on,' you confounded old villain; and don't let us have a {{repetition}} of your disgraceful conduct. And, good evening to you, Jack, and, damn you, take this." [...] He thrust a five pound note– a considerable sum in those days– into Newman's hands.|$|E
2500|$|CRI President Hank Hanegraff {{was baptized}} into the Eastern Orthodox church on Palm Sunday, April 9, 2017. [...] In a {{subsequent}} broadcast Hanegraff responded to {{charges that he}} had [...] "walked away from the Christian faith" [...] due to his departure from Protestant Christianity. [...] "If I have caused any to stumble <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> ask for forgiveness. My purpose in reading {{this is not so}} much to respond to anyone, but to reassure....I have never been more deeply in love with the Lord Jesus Christ and his body the church." [...] CRI has defended the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of theosis in a video on the CRI website. Hanegraff's conversion has raised questions among evangelicals, who point to major differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelical Protestantism.|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, Coltrane had a {{religious}} experience {{that may have}} helped him overcome the heroin addiction and alcoholism he had struggled with since 1948. In the liner notes of A Love Supreme, Coltrane states that, in 1957, [...] "I experienced, {{by the grace of}} God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music." [...] The liner notes appear to mention God in a Universalist sense, and do not advocate one religion over another. Further evidence of this universal view regarding spirituality {{can be found in the}} liner notes of Meditations (1965), in which Coltrane declares, [...] "I believe in all religions." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{there were}} rumours that Sun He {{could no longer}} secure his {{position}} as Crown Prince, Lu Xun wrote a memorial to Sun Quan: [...] "The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir apparent so he should have a foundation as solid as hard rock. The Prince of Lu is a vassal and a subject of the state, so he should receive less favours than the Crown Prince. If both of them know their places, Your Majesty and all your subjects will have peace. <b>I</b> <b>humbly</b> kowtow and beg Your Majesty, {{to the point of}} bleeding (from my forehead), to (re)consider this issue carefully." [...] He wrote several memorials to Sun Quan and even requested to leave Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and go to the capital to speak up on this problem. Sun Quan denied him permission. Lu Xun's maternal nephews Gu Tan, Gu Cheng (顧承) and Yao Xin (姚信), who supported Sun He during the succession struggle, were sent into exile. Wu Can, the Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅), who had been exchanging letters with Lu Xun, was imprisoned and later executed.|$|E
