50|$|The river <b>inter-linking</b> {{idea was}} revived in 1999, {{after a new}} {{political}} alliance formed the central government, but {{this time with a}} major strategic shift. The proposal was modified to intra-basin development as opposed to inter-basin water transfer.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of {{the rivers}} <b>inter-linking</b> {{projects}} claim {{the answers to}} India's water problem is to conserve the abundant monsoon water bounty, store it in reservoirs, and deliver this water - using rivers <b>inter-linking</b> project - to areas and over times when water becomes scarce. Beyond water security, the project is also seen to offer potential benefits to transport infrastructure through navigation, {{as well as to}} broadening income sources in rural areas through fish farming. Opponents are concerned about knowledge gap on environmental, ecological, social displacement impacts as well as unseen and unknown risks associated with tinkering with nature. Others are concerned that some projects create international impact and the rights of nations such as Bangladesh must be respected and negotiated.|$|E

50|$|India {{approved}} and commissioned NDWA in June 2005 {{to identify and}} complete feasibility studies of intra-State projects that would inter-link rivers within that state. The Governments of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Kerala, Punjab, Delhi, Sikkim, Haryana, Union Territories of Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar islands, Daman & Diu and Lakshadweep responded {{that they have no}} intrastate river connecting proposals. Govt. of Puducherry proposed Pennaiyar - Sankarabarani link (even though it is not an intrastate project). The States Government of Bihar proposed 6 <b>inter-linking</b> projects, Maharashtra 20 projects, Gujarat 1 project, Orissa 3 projects, Rajasthan 2 projects, Jharkhand 3 projects and Tamil Nadu proposed 1 <b>inter-linking</b> proposal between rivers inside their respective territories. Since 2005, NDWA completed feasibility studies on the projects, found 1 project infeasible, 20 projects as feasible, 1 project was withdrawn by Government of Maharashtra, and others are still under study.|$|E
50|$|Population {{increase}} in India {{is the other}} driver of need for river <b>inter-linking.</b> India's population growth rate has been falling, but still continues to increase by about 10 to 15 million people every year. The resulting demand for food must be satisfied with higher yields and better crop security, both of which require adequate irrigation of about 140 million hectares of land. Currently, {{just a fraction of}} that land is irrigated, and most irrigation relies on monsoon. River <b>inter-linking</b> is claimed to be a possible means of assured and better irrigation for more farmers, and thus better food security for a growing population. In a tropical country like India with high evapotranspiration, food security can be achieved with water security which in turn is achieved with energy security to pump water to uplands from water surplus lower elevation river points up to sea level.|$|E

30|$|As the {{anesthetic}} dose is increased, {{the patients}} enter {{a state of}} paradoxical excitation characterized by euphoria or dysphoria, defensive or purposeless movements, and incoherent speech, along {{with an increase in}} beta activity (13 – 25  Hz) in the EEG. This state is termed paradoxical since the anesthetic, intended to induce unconsciousness, results in excitation (Brown et al. 2010). Initially, as the gradually increasing number of anesthetic molecules are bound to the lipid membranes, more <b>inter-LINKs</b> are formed between the existing islets of <b>inter-LINKed</b> postsynapses (Fig.  6 a, b). Normally, oscillating potentials are expected to keep the output neurons in layer 5 of the motor cortex at a sub-threshold level of activation (Vadakkan 2013) that will enable them to fire upon the arrival of additional potentials. As anesthetics induce more inter-postsynaptic LINKs, this will lead to firing of several sub-threshold activated motor neurons in the motor cortex. This can explain the paradoxical excitation stage of anesthesia. As the depth of anesthesia is increased, EEG shows increasing slowness in the frequency of the waveforms. As more islets of <b>inter-LINKed</b> postsynapses get <b>inter-LINKed,</b> the magnitude of the horizontal component increases driving the frequency of oscillations to the lower side (Fig.  6 c). This can explain the observed high gamma power during anesthesia (Murphy et al. 2011). The increase in the extracellular space after administration of ketamine/xylazine compared to the wake state (Xie et al. 2013) likely correlates with possible increased inter-postsynaptic membrane hemifusion.|$|R
40|$|Geometry-based {{stochastic}} {{channel models}} (GSCMs) are extended to support multi-link simulations {{by applying the}} concept of common clusters. This novel approach aims to control the correlation between different links, <b>inter-link</b> correlation, by adjusting the amount of power simultaneously propagating via the same clusters in the different links. The behavior of common clusters is analyzed based on dual-link channel measurements, and a multi-link GSCM is developed based on common clusters. In addition, the effects that the common clusters have on <b>inter-link</b> correlation and on sum rate capacity are investigated based on simulations. Finally, comparison between simulations and measurements is done in order to indicate {{the validity of the}} proposed multi-link GSCM...|$|R

50|$|Misra et al. {{in their}} 2007 report, claim <b>inter-linking</b> of rivers {{initially}} {{appears to be}} a costly proposition in ecological, geological, hydrological and economical terms, in the long run the net benefits coming from it will far outweigh these costs or losses. However, they suggest that {{there is a lack of}} an international legal framework for the projects India is proposing.

40|$|Floating {{production}} {{storage and}} offloading platforms (FPSOs) {{used in the}} offshore oil and gas industries are moored by several mooring lines consisting of wire rope and chain. Chain wear is an issue for mooring line safety. Herein full-scale experiments are reported for assessing the wear that may be experienced by chains under operation conditions. Since such tests are very expensive, scale experiments are being assessed as possible substitutes and to allow many more parameters to be tested. The experiments show that chain wear increases with increased axial tension and with greater <b>inter-link</b> angular movement. Wear is much greater when the <b>inter-link</b> rotations occur under dry conditions compared to continually wet conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{complementarity}} {{techniques have}} been developed for modeling non-smooth contact and collision dynamics problems for multi-link robotic systems. In this ap-proach, a linear complementarity problem (LCP) is set up using 6 n non-minimal coordinates for a system with n links together with all the unilateral constraints and <b>inter-link</b> bilateral constraints on the system. In this paper, we use operational space dynamics to develop a complementarity formulation for contact and collision dynamics that uses minimal coordinates. The use of such non-redundant coordinates results in much smaller size LCP problems and the automatic enforcement of the <b>inter-link</b> bilateral constraints. Furthermore, we exploit operational space low-order algorithms to overcome some of the computational bottlenecks in using minimal coordinates. I...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a simple}} {{agent-based}} {{model of the}} recurring fashion cycles in the society that consists of two interacting communities: "snobs" and "followers" (or "opinion hunters", hence {{the name of the}} model). Followers conform to all other individuals, whereas snobs conform only to their own group and anticonform to the other. The model allows to examine the role of the social structure, i. e. the influence of the number of <b>inter-links</b> between the two communities, as well as the role of the stability of links. The latter is accomplished by considering two versions of the same model-quenched (parameterized by fraction L of fixed <b>inter-links)</b> and annealed (parameterized by probability p that a given <b>inter-link</b> exists). Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical treatment (the latter only for the annealed model), we show that there is a critical fraction of <b>inter-links,</b> above which recurring cycles occur. For p ≤ 0. 5 we derive a relation between parameters L and p that allows to compare both models and show that the critical value of inter-connections, p*, is the same for both versions of the model (annealed and quenched) but the period of a fashion cycle is shorter for the quenched model. Near the critical point, the cycles are irregular and a change of fashion is difficult to predict. For the annealed model we also provide a deeper theoretical analysis. We conjecture on topological grounds that the so-called saddle node heteroclinic bifurcation appears at p*. For p ≥ 0. 5 we show analytically the existence of the second critical value of p, for which the system undergoes Hopf's bifurcation...|$|R
