40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{refers to}} the ability of the human visual system to (partially) adapt to the intensity and colour of the illumination, producing an approximately colour constant appearance of objects across changes in illumination. It has been studied intensively during the past decades for its scientific potential to improve our understanding of human colour vision and for its practical implications in lighting design, printing and display technology. Models that predict the adaptive shift due to changes in lighting/viewing conditions are referred to as Chromatic Adaptation Transforms (CATs). They are typically based on one or more sets of corresponding colours (CC), which are colours that appear similar under different lighting conditions. However, most previous CC experiments were limited to near neutral illuminants, while new solid-state lighting technologies open up a range of potentially chromatic illuminants for which no systematic CCs or CAT is available. Therefore, new CC data will be collected to 1) increase our understanding of CA and 2) to derive a new CAT applicable to a wider range of illuminants. CC data will be collected using a novel viewing booth in which a data projector will be used to independently adjust the chromaticity and luminance of a real 3 D stimulus and of the background adaptation field. The projector based setup allows a strict focus on the adaptive shift by seperating it from the <b>colorimetric</b> <b>illuminant</b> <b>shift,</b> while the enhanced realism of physical 3 D scenes, compared to 2 D stimuli presented on a display, should result in a chromatic adaptation process more representative of real-life viewing conditions (e. g. {{it has been reported that}} the degree of adaptation is lower for softcopy stimuli). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the investigation of colour memory of users (designers, printers, students, etc.) in cross-media situations, particularly, between physical (printed) and digital (on-screen) colours. The preliminary experiment reported here supports findings by other researchers that there are systematic shifts between the memory colours of observers and the target colours that are being memorized. The results also confirm our hypothesis that when users are asked to select a colour on screen to represent a memorized target (or, we argue, to represent a colour that they have imagined) there are additional systematic <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shifts.</b> Users tend to select colours that are much more saturated then the target. There are implications of this work for soft-proofing and the use of imaging software by designers...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The need {{to detect}} trace amounts of target {{molecules}} is great, {{particularly when it}} comes to biosensing. With the early detection of a disease, the odds of the successful treatment of an individual increases significantly. To enhance the capability of biomolecular detection, we have created an optical biosensor capable of the enhancement of multi-modal optical signals. Our substrate employs diatoms, a type of algae, with unique optical properties to achieve multi-modal enhancement. Diatom shells, called frustules, are made of biosilica with quasi-periodic pores. These frustules exhibit a very large surface area which allows for a large area of interaction for analytes. Additionally, the porous structure of the frustule acts as a photonic crystal capable of enhancing optical signals. Here we demonstrate the multi-modal enhancement capabilities of our biosensor through the detection of biological analytes using <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shifts,</b> surface enhanced Raman scattering and fluorescence biosensing...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Diblock {{copolymer}} vesicles are tagged with pH-responsive Nile Blue-based {{labels and}} used as {{a new type of}} pH-responsive colorimetric/fluorescent biosensor for far-red and near-infrared imaging of live cells. The diblock copolymer vesic les descr ibed herein are based on poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphorylcholine-block- 2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) [PMPC-PDPA]: the biomimetic PMPC block is known to facilitate rapid cell uptake {{for a wide range of}} cell lines, while the PDPA block constitutes the pH-responsive component that enables facile vesicle self-assembly in aqueous solution. These biocompatible vesicles can be utilized to detect interstitial hypoxic/acidic regions in a tumor model via a pH-dependent <b>colorimetric</b> <b>shift.</b> In addition, they are also useful for selective intracellular staining of lysosomes and early endosomes via subtle changes in fluorescence emission. Such nanoparticles combine efficient cellular uptake with a pH-responsive Nile Blue dye label to produce a highly versatile dual capability probe. This is in marked contrast to small molecule dyes, which are usually poorly uptaken by cells, frequently exhibit cytotoxicity, and are characterized by intracellular distributions invariably dictated by their hydrophilic...|$|R
40|$|The {{trichromatic}} {{principle of}} representing color has {{for a long}} time been dominating in color imaging. The reason is the trichromatic nature of human color vision, but as the characteristics of typical color imaging devices are different from those of human eyes, {{there is a need to}} go beyond the trichromatic approach. The interest for multi-channel imaging, i. e. increasing the number of color channels, has made it an active research topic with a substantial potential of application.

30|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is a major}} {{life-threatening}} {{disease for}} human, and the identification of TB at an earlier stage is shown to prevent spreading and to treat the disease. In this study, we choose an early secretory antigenic target (ESAT- 6), {{one of the major}} proteins in TB. We introduced a single-step antibody-based <b>colorimetric</b> red spectral <b>shift</b> assay using gold nanoparticle, and the detection limit was found to be 1.25  pM. The specificity of this assay was elucidated by using the control protein (CFP- 10), and it does not show the color change upon adding GNP. On the other hand, ESAT- 6 alone is not bound to GNP. With this evidence, the presence of pre-complexed ESAT- 6 and anti-ESAT- 6 antibody was demonstrated with the reliability of the <b>colorimetric</b> red spectral <b>shift</b> assay. This strategy is simple and quick to detect similar kinds of analyte as a single step. Further, this assay can be expanded with a small molecule complexed with an appropriate antibody to be suitable for point-of-care detection. This methodology will definitely work with smaller-size proteins and peptides. With larger-size proteins, depending on the amino acid charges, there might be a variation.|$|R
30|$|To {{develop the}} {{colorimetric}} detection of ESAT- 6 by antibody-based <b>colorimetric</b> red <b>shift</b> spectral changes, 1  μl of 1  μM ESAT- 6 (final volume will be 500  nM) was initially mixed with 1  μl of optimal anti-ESAT- 6 antibody concentration. After 30  min of incubation, 20  μl of GNP {{was added to}} each tube and then waited for 30  min. Then, the optimal NaCl concentration was added, and the spectral changes were measured under the wavelength from 400 to 800  nm. Similarly, the other concentrations of ESAT- 6 (0 to 500  nM) were titrated with the same optimized anti-ESAT- 6 antibody concentration. To check the limit of detection, ESAT- 6 was tested from the lowest picomolar (from 1.25  pM) until the nanomolar (500  nM) order. The concentrations of other molecules (anti-ESAT- 6 antibody, GNP and NaCl) were kept constant.|$|R

This {{standard}} defines the spectral power distribution of the two fundamental <b>colorimetric</b> <b>illuminants,</b> Illuminant A and D 65 at 1 nm intervals to six significant digits. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of CIE Standard Illuminat A is based on Planck's law, the relative spectral power distribution has been calculated using Plank's formula at every nanometer between 300 nm and 830 nm. Although the SPD could be calculated also at intermediate wavelength directly from Planck's formula, the standard states that for such wavelengths linear interpolation should be used. The difference between the linearly interpolated value and the exact SPD calculated from Planck's formula is at 300 nm of the order of 10 - 4, at longer wavelength it becomes even less significant. Thus one can state tha...|$|R

The reason is the trichromatic nature of human color vision, but as the characteristics of typical color imaging devices are different from those of human eyes, {{there is a need to}} go beyond the trichromatic approach. The interest for multi-channel imaging, i. e. increasing the number of color channels, has made it an active research topic with a substantial potential of application. To achieve consistent color imaging, one needs to map the imaging-device data to the device-independent colorimetric representations CIEXYZ or CIELAB, the key concept of color management. As the color coordinates depend not only on the reflective spectrum of the object but also on the spectral properties of the <b>illuminant,</b> the <b>colorimetric</b> representation suffers from metamerism, i. e. objects of the same color under a specific illumination may appear different when they are illuminated by other light sources. Furthermore, when the sensitivities of the imaging device differ from the CIE color matching functions, two spectra that appear different for human observers may result in identical device response. On contrary, in multispectral imaging, color is represented by the object’s physical characteristics namely the spectrum which is illuminant independent. With multispectral imaging, different spectra are readily distinguishable, no matter they are metameric or not. The spectrum can then be transformed to any color space and be rendered under any illumination. The focus of the thesis is high quality image-acquisition in colorimetric and multispectral formats. The image acquisition system used is an experimental system with great flexibility in illumination and image acquisition setup. Besides the conventional trichromatic RGB filters, the system also provides the possibility of acquiring multi-channel images, using 7 narrowband filters. A thorough calibration and characterization of all the components involved in the image acquisition system is carried out. The spectral sensitivity of the CCD camera, which can not be derived by direct measurements, is estimated using least squares regression, optimizing the camera response to measured spectral reflectance of carefully selected color samples. To derive mappings to colorimetric and multispectral representations, two conceptually different approaches are used. In the model-based approach, the physical model describing the image acquisition process is inverted, to reconstruct spectral reflectance from the recorded device response. In the empirical approach, the characteristics of the individual components are ignored, and the functions are derived by relating the device response for a set of test colors to the corresponding colorimetric and spectral measurements, using linear and polynomial least squares regression. The results indicate that for trichromatic imaging, accurate colorimetric mappings can be derived by the empirical approach, using polynomial regression to CIEXYZ and CIELAB. Because of the media-dependency, the characterization functions should be derived for each combination of media and colorants. However, accurate spectral data reconstruction requires for multi-channel imaging, using the model-based approach. Moreover, the model-based approach is general, since it is based on the spectral characteristics of the image acquisition system, rather than the characteristics of a set of color samples.
