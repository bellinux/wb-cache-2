5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as quickly as possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined.

5|$|However, {{independent}} reviews <b>have</b> <b>called</b> {{into question}} the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies.

5|$|Las Casas's legacy {{has been}} highly controversial. In the years {{following}} his death his ideas became taboo in the Spanish realm, and he {{was seen as a}} nearly heretical extremist; the accounts written by his enemies Lopez de Gómara and Oviedo were widely read and published. As the British empire rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used Las Casas's accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool making it part of the foundation of what Spanish nationalists <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the Black Legend, the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past, while looking mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.|$|E
5|$|Mythology has it {{that the}} forests of Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. Some authors <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Birbhum by the name Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Tantrics, {{including}} the Vajrayana, the Shaktas, and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship. Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa.|$|E
5|$|Neutopia {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda in nearly every aspect.

But overall, reviewers <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Neutopia one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game NeutopiaII, in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.|$|E
