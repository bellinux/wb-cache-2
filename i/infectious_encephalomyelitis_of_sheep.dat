50|$|Louping-ill (also {{known as}} Ovine Encephalomyelitis, <b>Infectious</b> <b>Encephalomyelitis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sheep,</b> Trembling-ill) is an acute viral disease {{primarily}} of sheep that {{is characterized by}} a biphasic fever, depression, ataxia, muscular incoordination, tremors, posterior paralysis, coma, and death. Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{establish}} the specific symptomatic ethological pathognomonic complex <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> in poultry. The behavioural changes were monitored in 2 -week-old broiler chickens  (total number 10, 500 housed in three premises). The typical pathoethological manifestations <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> were investigated in broiler chickens through six behavioural activities – locomotion, appetite, water drinking, pareses, paralyses, posture. As a result of the survey, the specific ethological pathognomonic complex for <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> in chickens was identified. These clinical manifestations of a pathoethological complex and specific behavioural activities could be used to support the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{chickens}} {{were fed}} viral vaccines that {{were applied to}} the surface of food pellets. Responses were judged by the production of specific antibodies, and compared with the responses obtained when the same vaccines were given by conventional routes. Chickens responded similarly to commercial avian <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> vaccine given on food or by eyedrop when antibodies were measured by ELISA, and the vaccine virus spread by contact. Increasing the dose of oral vaccine tenfold gave a more rapid serological response but the levels of antibody were not increased. There was no serological response to commercial infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine given on food. An experimental avian adenovirus vaccine produced a serological response when given on food, but higher levels of antibody were produced in response to vaccination by eyedrop. The vaccine virus spread by contact. It was concluded that current avian <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> vaccines, and prospective recombinant vaccines based on avian adenovirus vectors, could be delivered on food...|$|R

40|$|Acute disseminated {{encephalomyelitis}} (ADEM) {{also known}} as post <b>infectious</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> is a demyelinating disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) that typically presents as a monophasic disorder associated with multifocal neurological symptoms and disability. It may follow vaccination in children or infection. Viral infection like measles, rubella, influenza, Epstein bar, HIV, herpes, cytomegalusvirus (CMV) and West Nile virus have been implicated in the causation. Among bacteria, group A hemolytic streptococcus, mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia, Rickettesia and leptospira have been shown to cause ADEM. There are few reports of ADEM due to tuberculosis (TB). We describe acute disseminated encephalomyelitis due to tuberculosis in a 35 year old female who initially started with neuropsychiatric manifestations and later developed florid neurological deficit and classical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions suggestive of the disease. The patient recovered completely after antitubercular therapy and is following our clinic for the last 12 months now...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the influence of}} the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) on the past, present and future distributions <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in Australia. Design The role of the dingo in the rise and fall <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> numbers is reviewed, revised data are provided on the present distribution and density <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and dingoes, and historical patterns <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> distribution are used to explore the future <b>of</b> rangeland <b>sheep</b> grazing. Results Dingoes are a critical causal factor in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> at the national, regional and local levels. Dingo predation contributed substantially to the historical contraction <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> industry to its present-day distribution, which is almost exclusively confined to areas within fenced dingo exclusion zones. Dingo populations and/or their influence are now present and increasing in all <b>sheep</b> production zones <b>of</b> Australia, inclusive of areas that were once dingo free'. Conclusions Rangeland production <b>of</b> wool and <b>sheep</b> meat is predicted to disappear within 30 - 40 years if the present rate of contraction of the industry continues unabated. Understanding the influence <b>of</b> dingoes on <b>sheep</b> production may help refine disease response strategies and help predict the future distribution <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and their diseases...|$|R

This study was conducted in four commercial ﬂocks <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> in winter pastures of north of Golestan province (Gomishan and Aq-Qala) during the grazing season at December 2010 to April 2011.
