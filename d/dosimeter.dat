The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's <b>dosimeter</b> and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E

40|$|Polymer gel <b>dosimeters</b> are {{fabricated}} from radiation sensitive chemicals which, upon irradiation, polymerize as {{a function}} of the absorbed radiation dose. These gel <b>dosimeters,</b> with the capacity to uniquely record the radiation dose distribution in three-dimensions (3 D), have specific advantages when compared to one-dimensional <b>dosimeters,</b> such as ion chambers, and two-dimensional <b>dosimeters,</b> such as film. These advantages are particularly significant in dosimetry situations where steep dose gradients exist such as in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery. Polymer gel <b>dosimeters</b> also have specific advantages for brachytherapy dosimetry. Potential dosimetry applications include those for low-energy x-rays, high-linear energy transfer (LET) and proton therapy, radionuclide and boron capture neutron therapy dosimetries. These 3 D <b>dosimeters</b> are radiologically soft-tissue equivalent with properties that may be modified depending on the application.

25|$|In April 2012 the {{government}} of the evacuated city of Namie bought a whole-body <b>dosimeter.</b> The device was installed in a temporary housing in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, in order to monitor the internal radiation exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished {{at the end of the}} fiscal year 2012. In this way {{the government}} of Namie wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from SPEEDI were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.|$|E
25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or <b>dosimeter</b> will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E
25|$|Scintillation {{detectors}} use crystals that emit {{light when}} gamma rays {{interact with the}} atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is usually proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray; a well known situation where this relationship fails is the absorption of <200keV radiation by intrinsic and doped sodium iodide detectors. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a thermoluminescent <b>dosimeter.</b> The detectors are joined to photomultipliers; a photocathode converts the light into electrons; and then by using dynodes to generate electron cascades through delta ray production, the signal is amplified. Common scintillators include thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to sodium iodide (NaI) detectors—and bismuth germanate (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in light-tight coverings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Dose Measurement at a Radiotherapy Workplace by Means of Personal <b>Dosimeters</b> Ionising {{radiation}} {{may have}} negative influence on human organism, {{which is why}} protection against it is so important. Limits for radiotherapy workplaces, where medical staff work every day close to a source of the radiation, are defined by Decree No. 184 / 1997 Col. Personal monitoring is used at workplaces with ionizing radiation sources to measure monthly doses, which should not exceed particular limits. Personal <b>dosimeters,</b> apparatuses capable of detecting ionizing radiation are used for personnel monitoring. There are various types of <b>dosimeters</b> available, based on different principles. So called film <b>dosimeters</b> are used at the radiotherapy department of the Hospital České Budějovice. These <b>dosimeters</b> are sent to the National Personal Dosimetry Service every month where they are assessed.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the dosimetric characteristics of PRESAGEREU <b>dosimeters.</b> Commercially available PRESAGEREU <b>dosimeters</b> (size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 45 mm) {{were divided into}} two groups, with one of the groups placed at room temperature of 22 °C (RT group) and another group placed at low temperature of 10 °C (LT group). A total of 3 <b>dosimeters</b> (set of <b>dosimeters)</b> were irradiated at a time, with doses of 1 Gy, 2 Gy, 4 Gy, 8 Gy, 12 Gy, 16 Gy, and 20 Gy, at a nominal dose rate of 400 MU/min at temperature of 22 °C. The <b>dosimeters</b> were irradiated three additional times by delivering the same doses as those during the initial irradiations (4 irradiation cycles). Optical density (OD) was assessed using optical CT scanning. Considering both linearity and sensitivity of the OD curves, R 2 above 0. 95 and sensitivity above 0. 04 ΔOD/Gy were observed at the 1 st irradiation (reading time ≤ 6 h) and 2 nd irradiation (reading time = 0. 5 h) for the RT group. For the LT group, those values were observed at the 1 st irradiation (reading time ≤ 2 h), and the 3 rd and 4 th irradiations (both reading times = 0. 5 h). Considering the reproducibility of signals in response to the same dose, <b>dosimeters</b> in the RT group showed average deviations among <b>dosimeters</b> less than 5 % (the 1 st and 2 nd irradiations at the reading time of 0. 5 h), while for <b>dosimeters</b> in the LT group showed average deviations among <b>dosimeters</b> less than 6 % (the 3 rd and 4 th irradiations at the reading time of 0. 5 h). For the rest, the OD curves were not linear, sensitivities of the <b>dosimeters</b> were lower than 0. 04 ΔOD/Gy, and OD deviations at the same dose were larger than 6 %. At room temperature, PRESAGEREU <b>dosimeters</b> could be used for dose measurement only for up to two dose measurement sessions. At low temperatures, usage of PRESAGEREU <b>dosimeters</b> for dose measurement seems to be possible from the 3 rd irradiation. When reusing PRESAGEREU <b>dosimeters,</b> the OD curve should be re-defined for every measurement session because the shape of this curve depends on the irradiation history...|$|R
50|$|Although polymer-type <b>dosimeters</b> did {{not have}} the {{diffusion}} limitations of Fricke-type gel <b>dosimeters,</b> there was another significant limitation in their use. Due to the nature of their free radical chemistry, polymer gel <b>dosimeters</b> were susceptible to atmospheric oxygen inhibition of the polymerisation processes. As a result, these gel <b>dosimeters</b> had to be manufactured in an oxygen-free environment, such as in a glove box pumped with nitrogen gas. Along with the use of potentially toxic chemicals, this was a significant limitation in the introduction of gel dosimetry into the clinic.|$|R
25|$|On 23 June 2013 {{during a}} meeting with {{evacuees}} from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents {{would be allowed to}} return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of <b>dosimeter</b> so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.|$|E

The relative dose was calculated and compared to more standard dose measurement techniques: an unmodified OSLD, a micro-ionization chamber (MIC), and a silicon diode.
