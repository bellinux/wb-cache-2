40|$|Fibres {{obtained}} by gel spinning of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) {{were drawn to}} various ratios, and {{the improvement of the}} tensile strength of the hot-drawn filaments with increasing draw ratio has been studied. The tensile force at break of gel-spun/hot-drawn UHMWPE fibres appeared to be constant for draw ratios exceeding lambda = 30. From scaling arguments, full chain extension is expected at this draw ratio. On the basis of development of the physical properties during drawing, it is concluded that little disentangling occurs up to lambda = 30. Beyond this point, slippage of chains through entanglement hooks becomes predominant. The observed constant tensile force at break can be explained by this <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Registers of the {{mercenary}} infantry give many {{information about}} types of weapon and its quality. In Warsaw archive we have rolls from 1471, 1477 and 1496 - 1500 {{with information about}} 7000 mercenaries. In rolls we meet different descriptions of quality of crossbows like: good, bed, new, old, used, repaired. We can clasify about 47 % of crossbows as bed, basing on the sources from 1471 and 1477, which contain all these terms. In 1496 we have 14 %, and in 1498 - 22 % bad or old crossbows. Registers give also information about different types of crossbows used by soldiers. They had crossbows with two kinds of bow - horn or steel. Only two from 597 mercenaries had this last type in 1496, similary in 1498, 9 from 725 crossbowmen possesed steel bows. Soldiers used three types of bend mechanism. The oldest one hed the bow-string stretched by hook fastened to soldier’s belt. This type is named kryg in Polish sources. Second kind of belt mechanism is goat’s foot called hewar in medieval Poland (from word „lewar” - lever). <b>Drawing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which we know as cranequin or windelass appeared in sources as klyky (from Czech word klika - crank) {{and this is the}} third kind of mechanism. All these three different kinds of <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> could be used by soldiers of the one troop at the same time. Second typ of shooting weapon was bow. This kind of arms was unpopular among mercenaries in end of XV c. Only two soldiers used bows. First bow we meet in 1498 (it is 1 from 725 shooters).

40|$|A new {{technique}} on friction aided deep drawing has been proposed. A metal blank holder {{was designed to}} be of two layers: stationary layer or base with four planes of 5 degrees taper angle and moving layer divided into four tapered segments. Under appropriate blank holding force, these four segments can move radially to the die opening with a constant speed by using a specially designed compression tool. The main function of this developed blank holding device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using an assistant metal punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

50|$|Mounted knights {{armed with}} lances proved {{ineffective}} against formations of pikemen combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor.

Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own. Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by more powerful gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen (pike and shot), pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines.|$|R

A taper blank holder {{is designed to}} be of two parts: stationary part with 5 degree taper angle and moving parts divided into eight tapered segments.

40|$|Foliar {{nutrient}} contents {{are evaluated}} in several fruit trees with many objectives. Leaf analysis constitutes {{a way of}} evaluating the nutritional requirements of crops. Due to the positive impact that fertilizers have on crop yields, researchers frequently try to evaluate the correlations between yield and foliar nutrient contents. This work's objective was to present fruit yields from the 4 th to the 6 th cropping seasons, evaluate foliar nutrient contents (on the 5 th cropping season), and estimate the correlations between these two groups of traits for 20 half-sibling custard apple tree progenies. The progenies were evaluated in a random block design with five replicates and four plants per plot. One hundred leaves were collected from the middle third of the canopy (in height) of each of four plants in each plot. The leaves were collected haphazardly, i. e., in a random manner, but without using a <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In the analysis of variance, the nutrient concentrations in the leaves from plants of each plot were represented by the average of four plants in the plot. Fruit yield in the various progenies did not depend on cropping season; progeny A 4 was the most productive. No Spearman correlation was found between leaf nutrient concentrations and fruit yield. Increased nutrient concentrations in the leaves were progeny-dependent, i. e., with regard to Na (progenies FE 5 and JG 1), Ca (progeny A 4), Mg (progeny SM 7), N (progeny A 3), P (progeny M), and K contents (progeny JG 3).

40|$|Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) {{technology}} has {{great potential for}} more efficient mining of Australian thick coal seams. LTCC can potentially double (or greater) the longwall recoverable tonnes, per metre of gateroad development and improve the safety standards in longwall operation. Accurate cavability assessment of the coal seam is the key pre-requisite for successful application of LTCC method. Although some cavability criteria were developed in previous studies, their shortcomings limit their application. Apart {{from the lack of}} suitable cavability criterion, the caving principles and mechanisms in longwall operation (and LTCC) is still not well understood. The main objectives of this research work were: 1. to improve the general understanding about the caving mechanisms involved in LTCC operation, 2. to develop a new cavability assessment criterion, and 3. to characterise and classify the caving behaviour in selected Australian longwall operations. For this study a combination of analytical, observational and empirical engineering methods were used to reduce the shortcoming of individual design methods. For analytical study, the Distinct Element Method (DEM) was selected for computational analysis as the most suitable technique for this type of study. For observational methods, the size distribution of particles in goaf was used as a monitoring measure for caving performance evaluation and this method was performed in three Australian longwall operations (Ulan, West Wallsend and Broadmeadow). The Empirical assessment was performed by using the results of observational/computational analyses along with basic geological/geotechnical data from selected mine sites to back analyse and re-evaluate the results. The most significant outcomes of this study include: 1. a new cavability assessment system (Top Coal Cavability Rating, TCCR) that was developed based on computational analysis and by back analysis of past LTCC experience in China, 2. Improved understanding of caving mechanism, deformation mechanism and <b>drawing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of top coal in LTCC method, 3. advanced numerical models (UDEC, 3 DEC and PFC models) that not only can be used for future research but can also be employed for LTCC design purposes, 4. characterisation and classification of caving behaviour in three Australian longwall operations. The results of this study can be effectively used by Australian coal industry in feasibility and design studies of LTCC operation. The new cavability criterion can be used to identify and quantify the major risks that may be involved in LTCC application...|$|E
