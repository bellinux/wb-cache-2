5|$|In {{the village}} of Soekasari, Mardjan (Oedjang) is forcefully evicting people {{who are unable to}} pay their taxes to his boss, the {{landlord}} Hadji Doerachman (Moesa). Doerachman, though aware of this, is unwilling to stop <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> after his daughter, Atikah (Soelastri), tries to convince him.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{enormously}} {{popular with the}} American public. Streets, public works, and children were named after <b>him.</b> <b>Even</b> a dance step was named after him. In 1955, his promotion to General of the Armies was proposed in Congress, but the proposal was shelved.|$|E
5|$|With the Kid's girl Christian {{visiting her}} parents, Melba tries to seduce <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> though she and Christian are close friends. Out {{of respect for}} Shooter, he rebuffs her, and spends {{the day before the}} game with Christian at her family's farm.|$|E

5|$|A {{moment of}} silence was also held for Weylandt before stage 11, as his funeral took place the same day. Pieter Weening also gave the first pink jersey to be {{presented}} {{to him on the}} podium to Weylandt's surviving family, and stage 11 winner John Gadret stated that he had had Weylandt in his thoughts as he crossed the line and dedicated his win to <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> though the two were not well acquainted.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{rigorous}} training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when {{they learn that}} they both have advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects <b>him</b> <b>even</b> more for fighting her, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made <b>him</b> <b>even</b> more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through the}} street that morning? Very early! Jonas trembled {{at the thought of}} having had a narrow chance of seeing <b>him</b> himself; <b>even</b> <b>him,</b> who had no object but to avoid people, and sneak on unobserved, and keep his own secrets; and who saw nothing.|$|R
60|$|She {{would have}} urged <b>him</b> gently, <b>even</b> then, but he menaced {{her with his}} chain.|$|R
60|$|But nobody heard <b>him,</b> not <b>even</b> the {{two little}} boys, for they were sound asleep.|$|R
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered <b>him</b> <b>even</b> more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels {{spoke at}} party {{meetings}} in Munich {{and at the}} annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels {{was involved in the}} planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolize <b>him</b> <b>even</b> more.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved <b>him</b> <b>even</b> with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E

5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved <b>him</b> <b>even</b> to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|Johnson proclaimed {{amnesty for}} all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to <b>him</b> <b>even</b> though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E

5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on <b>him.</b> <b>Even</b> if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E

5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> {{to the point of being}} partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber {{qualified}} sixth for {{the first}} race of the season, the , but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time {{as a result of}} a gearbox failure. At the following race, the , Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career up to that point by splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up second on the grid. The race was less rewarding with a near-stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place but during an exciting battle with Ralf Schumacher, they collided, forcing Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty which left <b>him</b> <b>even</b> further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> if just to look at him through his window.|$|E
