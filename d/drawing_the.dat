5|$|When <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} {{follows a}} five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E

5|$|Greg Rucka and Michael Lark had {{previously}} collaborated on the comic series Gotham Central for DC Comics between 2002 and 2004 and various small projects for Marvel Comics {{in the years}} following. Lark {{wanted to work with}} Rucka on a creator-owned comic because he felt he was at his best <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> kind of stories Rucka writes.|$|E
5|$|He began <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> {{comic book}} in early 2005 with {{traditional}} art {{tools such as}} Mongol pencils and brushes. He took great care while illustrating Elmer because he felt his earlier work, Wasted, was poorly drawn. To devote time to completing the comic book, he had to quit his job working for US comic companies. As a result, the period between 2006 and 2008 {{was one of the}} most financially difficult times of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere {{hosted a}} visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. They stayed at Worsley Hall, {{with a view of}} the canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges.

5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} supportive role. For example, televangelist Jim Bakker expressed {{public support for the}} group Stryper, watching them perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members. Many new bands began to arise, eventually <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E
5|$|On the field, the Australians {{continued}} to flourish. The Third Test was a rain-affected draw, {{and between the}} First and Fourth Tests, they won four of their five county matches, <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> other. On {{the final day of}} the Fourth Test, Australia's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match, thereby taking a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, golf's {{increased}} {{popularity is}} commonly attributed to Woods' presence.

5|$|When Lark {{received}} the first script, he was disappointed. He felt {{none of the}} characters were likable, and the scene Rucka had described to him over dinner was not included. Rucka wrote a new draft to address Lark's concerns and restored the missing opening scene. Lark began <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> first issue in January 2013 and based the opening scene on the birth sequence in The Fifth Element.|$|E
5|$|Aerojet's {{first two}} {{contracts}} {{were from the}} U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics requested a solid-fuel JATO and the Wilbur Wright Field requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in {{as head of the}} company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> ire of many personnel.|$|E

However, his allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines {{in one of}} the most decisive battles in French history. John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France.|$|E
5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort.

He {{was active in the}} formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education.

5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to add {{more to the story}} as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> characters in the end.

50|$|The Mega Gem used in Power Lotto (mentioned below) was a {{compound}} {{version of the}} two types of Mega Gems stated above. <b>The</b> chamber which <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> main five numbers has its ball loading bays placed at the back, but had a separate tube where <b>the</b> five <b>drawn</b> number balls are directed. It was operated {{the same way as the}} Mega Gem used in the other number lottery games. <b>The</b> chamber that <b>drew</b> <b>the</b> power number was the same one used as those in the 6-Digit Game. The first chamber was first turned on to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> five main numbers. Afterwards, the first chamber was turned off and the second chamber was then switched on to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> power number. After the power number had been <b>drawn,</b> <b>the</b> entire machine was turned off.|$|R
