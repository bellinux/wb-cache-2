500|$|Although he socialized {{with his}} {{teammates}} and sometimes gambled, Sunday {{was never a}} heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, [...] "I never drank much.

[...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E

In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his [...] "best friend and the best of fathers...

He also felt his name would be a handicap and has since said [...] "If I had a completely open choice <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>I</b> would have chosen party politics, but because of my name, that's impossible."

500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan did not look up Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E

[...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." ...|$|E

Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E
