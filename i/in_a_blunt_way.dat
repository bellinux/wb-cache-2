In 1943, reversing the approach that had existed since Providentissimus Deus fifty years earlier, Pius XII's encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu expressed approval of historical-critical methods. For Brown, this was a [...] "Magna Carta for biblical progress." [...] In 1965, at the Second Vatican Council, the Church moved further in this direction, adopting the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei verbum, instead of the conservative schema [...] "On the Sources of Revelation" [...] that originally had been submitted. While it stated that Scripture teaches [...] "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation," [...] Brown points out the ambiguity of this statement, which opened the way for a new interpretation of inerrancy by shifting from a literal interpretation of the text towards a focus on [...] "the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God." [...] He saw this as the Church [...] "turning the corner" [...] on inerrancy, while adopting a face-saving wording: [...] "the Roman Catholic Church does not change her official stance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> <b>way.</b> Past statements are not rejected but are requoted with praise and then reinterpreted at the same time. ... What was really going on was an attempt gracefully to retain what was salvageable from the past and to move in a new direction at the same time." [...] While the document cited the two earlier encyclicals, it was clear to observers that much had changed. The Second Vatican Council, one scholar observed, “raised biblical exegesis from the status of second-class citizenship to which it had been reduced among Catholics by an overreaction to the Protestant claim for its autonomy.” ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{thought of}} my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race in general, I {{considered}} them, as they really were, Yahoos in shape and disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the share that nature allotted them. When I happened to behold the reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, I turned away my face in horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure {{the sight of a}} common Yahoo than of my own person. By conversing with the Houyhnhnms, and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their gait and gesture, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often tell me, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> <b>way,</b> “that I trot like a horse;” which, however, I take for a great compliment. Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the Houyhnhnms, and hear myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.|$|E

60|$|It is this continual {{incorporation}} of circumstances originally accidental, into the permanent signification of words, {{which is the}} cause {{that there are so}} few exact synonyms. It is this also which renders the dictionary meaning of a word, by universal remark so imperfect an exponent of its real meaning. The dictionary meaning is marked out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broad, <b>blunt</b> <b>way,</b> and probably includes all that was originally necessary for the correct employment of the term; but in process of time so many collateral associations adhere to words, that whoever should attempt to use them with no other guide than the dictionary, would confound a thousand nice distinctions and subtle shades of meaning which dictionaries take no account of; as we notice in the use of <b>a</b> language <b>in</b> conversation or writing by a foreigner not thoroughly master of it. The history of a word, by showing the causes which determine its use, is <b>in</b> these cases <b>a</b> better guide to its employment than any definition; for definitions can only show its meaning at the particular time, or at most the series of its successive meanings, but its history may show the law by which the succession was produced. The word gentleman, for instance, to the correct employment of which a dictionary would be no guide, originally meant simply <b>a</b> man born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain rank. From this it came by degrees to connote all such qualities or adventitious circumstances as were usually found to belong to persons of that rank. This consideration at once explains why in one of its vulgar acceptations it means any one who lives without labor, in another without manual labor, and in its more elevated signification it has in every age signified the conduct, character, habits, and outward appearance, in whomsoever found, which, according to the ideas of that age, belonged or were expected to belong to persons born and educated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high social position.|$|R
40|$|Is {{corporate}} leverage excessive? Is the {{tax code}} distorting corporate capital structure decisions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that increases {{the possibility of an}} economic crisis owing to "financial instability"? Answering these kinds of questions first requires some precision in terminology. In this paper, we describe the cases for and against the trend toward high leverage, and evaluate the role played by taxation. While provision of proper incentives to managers may in part underlie the trend to the debt, high leverage may <b>in</b> practice be <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> <b>way</b> to address the problem, and one which opens up the possibility for undue exposure to the risks of financial distress. Our story takes as given the kinds of managerial incentive problems deemed important by advocates of leverage. We maintain, however, that when a firm is subject to business-cycle risk as well as individual risk, a profit maximizing arrangement is not simple debt, but rather a contract with mixed debt and equity features. That is, the contract should index the principal obligation to aggregate and/or industry-level economic conditions. We argue that the tax system encourages corporations to absorb more business cycle risk than they would otherwise. It does so in two respects: First, it provides a relative subsidy to debt finance; second, it restricts debt for tax purposes from indexing the principal to common disturbances. At a deeper level, the issue hinges on the institutional aspects of debt renegotiation. If renegotiation were costless, then debt implicitly would have the equity features relevant for responding to business-cycle risk. However, because of the diffuse ownership pattern of much of the newly issued debt and also because of certain legal restrictions, renegotiation {{is likely to be a}} costly activity. ...|$|R
