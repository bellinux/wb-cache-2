5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and <b>herring-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} sources of {{variation}} of recruitment; first {{that due to}} random fluctuations alone, secondly that, due to variations in stock and thirdly variations which are extreme at low {{and high levels of}} stock and if these occur sequentially can cause catastrophic declines or sharp increases in stock density. From a study of stock/recruitment curves of a number of fish species, it appears that the curve for <b>herring-like</b> <b>fishes</b> differs markedly from those, for example, of cod-like fishes or in more general terms that the shape of the stock/recruitment curve is really a function of its fecundity. That for the <b>herring-like</b> <b>fishes</b> is a near linear curve whereas that for the cod-like fishes is markedly dome-shaped. It follows that the <b>herring-like</b> <b>fishes</b> are very vulnerable to long-term climatic changes and that the cod-like fishes are able to stabilize their populations through long-term climatic changes merely because the increased recruitment when stock is slightly reduced is very much greater than that for the <b>herring-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> If stocks of fish are to be managed then the stock/recruitment relatioilship has to be taken into account; a form of self regenerating yield curve combining stock/recruitment and yield-per-recruit was in fact put forward by BEVERTON and HOLT. A development of such a curve is needed and one of the uses of such a curve would he that management need not take too much notice of environmental change, because if it occurred the stock would have been exploited at its best rate before any environmental collapse took place...|$|E
50|$|The scaled sardine, Harengula jaguana, is a <b>herring-like</b> <b>fish</b> in {{the family}} Clupeidae. It is native to coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, from the Gulf of Mexico (where it {{is known as the}} {{pilchard}} or whitebait) down to Brazil where it is called mata.|$|R
50|$|Pholidophorus was a <b>herring-like</b> <b>fish</b> {{about 40}} cm long, {{although}} it was not closely related to modern herring. Like them, however, it had a single dorsal fin, a symmetrical tail, and an anal fin placed towards the rear of the body. It had large eyes and was probably a fast-swimming predator, hunting planktonic crustaceans and smaller fish.|$|R

50|$|<b>Herring-like</b> <b>fish</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} fish group on the planet. They are also the most populous fish. They are the dominant converter of zooplankton into fish, consuming copepods, arrow worms chaetognatha, pelagic amphipods hyperiidae, mysids and krill in the pelagic zone. Conversely, they are a central prey item or forage fish for higher trophic levels. The reasons for this success is still enigmatic; one speculation attributes their dominance to the huge, extremely fast cruising schools they inhabit.|$|R

40|$|The cephalic {{portions}} of the latero-sensory canal system in Denticeps clupeoides are described and analyzed. The species, a small <b>herring-like</b> <b>fish</b> from relictual West African streams, is the most primitive living clupeomorph and sole Recent representative of suborder Denticipitoidei. As sister group to over 360 species in Clupeoidei, Denticeps is a key taxon in understanding clupeomorph and lower teleostean relationships. Observations on recently-collected specimens of Denticeps clupeoides revealed comparatively-important and previously-unrecorded details of the cephalic latero-sensory canals which are relevant for understanding relationships at different levels in clupeomorph phylogeny. The infraorbital, supraorbital, preopercular, extrascapular and post-temporal canals of Denticeps have unbranched tubules in soft tissue, as in the hypothesized plesiomorphic condition for lower teleosts. Contrastingly, {{the presence of a}} complex network formed by a high order of branching of cephalic canals is hypothesized as a synapomorphy of the Clupeoidei. Denticeps and the Clupeoidei share an exclusive sensory branch that originates at the junction between the extrascapular bone and the recessus lateralis, here hypothesized as an additional synapomorphy of Clupeiformes. A supratemporal system is newly recorded in Denticeps, and the character is proposed as a synapomorphy of Clupeiformes, and not of Clupeoidei as previousl...|$|R
5000|$|The pygmy {{whitefish}} {{is a small}} <b>herring-like</b> <b>fish</b> with a {{long and}} cylindrical body by comparison to other whitefishes. Silvery in colour, it has a brownish back, and a whitish belly. Black spots on the side called [...] "parr marks", which are present on young trout or [...] "parrs", are present on the young of this species, and on adults in some Alaskan populations. Commonly ranging from 3 to 15.3 cm in length, it is typically 12 cm long, and reaches a maximum length of 28 cm. It is identified by its small size, and its large eye, which has a greater length than its blunt snout. Its dorsal fin and pectoral fin are usually clear, and its tail is clear with a faint dark spot. Its anal fin and pelvic fin are plain whitish. It has large scales with only 56-70 on its lateral line, fewer gill rakers, all characteristics that indicate a degree of differentiation from the other Prosopium fishes. Because of this, it is considered an early offshoot (basal) species in its genus, {{and it is the}} most trout-like member of a genus considered the most trout-like and primitive whitefish group.|$|R
