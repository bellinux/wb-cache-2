As a result, fungicides are used on 85-90% of all pecan acreage in southeastern states annually. <b>Fenbuconazole,</b> propiconazole, and TPTH are the primary fungicides used in the southeast for scab control. In the southwest however fungicides are rarely used because the dry growing conditions are not conducive to growth of pecan scab.|$|E
50|$|Septoria {{leaf spot}} infects the {{blueberry}} plant through spores ejected from infected leaves and stem lesions {{left on the}} ground from the previous harvest season. These spores infect the crop and small white/tan leaf lesions form on the plant and the stem in early May. These lesions continue to develop and multiply through September. Severe infection causes defoliation of the plant. This will lower fruit yield as the nutrient supply is reduced. In weaker infections where defoliation does not occur the loss of photosynthetic area will reduce yields as well. Use of <b>fenbuconazole</b> {{has been shown to}} be successful in controlling leaf spot. If applied at harvest it will help prevent leaf spot from forming the next year. It has been shown to average 45% greater yields in the next harvest.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAromatase enzyme plays {{a central}} role in steroidogenesis by {{converting}} androgens to estrogens and has been proposed as an important molecular target for many environmental endocrine disrupters chemicals. In this study, we have screened 30 selected pesticides with known, unknown or supposed effects on aromatase activity, for their ability to modulate aromatase activity in the human choriocarcinoma JEG- 3 cell line after both short (2 h) and long exposure (24 h). All pesticides were tested at concentrations up to 10 microM that did not cause cytotoxicity after 24 h of exposure, as verified by the MTT viability assay. Four pesticides inhibited aromatase activity after 2 h of exposure: prochloraz (IC(50) < 1 microM), <b>fenbuconazole</b> (IC(50) = 1. 1 microM), propiconazole (IC(50) = 1. 5 microM) and fenarimol (IC(50) = 3. 3 microM). Among them, prochloraz and <b>fenbuconazole</b> also exerted inhibitory effects after 24 h. Toxaphen (10 microM) and heptachlor (10 microM) inhibited aromatase activity after 24 h exposure only. Nine pesticides induced aromatase activity: aldrin, chlordane, cypermethrin, parathion-methyl, endosulfan, methoxychlor, oxadiazon, metolachlor and atrazine after 24 h of exposure, while tributyltin induced aromatase activity at 1 nM and 3 nM after both 2 h and 24 h of exposure, respectively. To further investigate the mechanisms of aromatase induction we measured CYP 19 mRNA expression and showed that methoxychlor, aldrin, chlordane and tributyltin induced the transcription of the cyp 19 gene. In addition, none of the aromatase inducers transactivated the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in JEG- 3 stably transfected with a RARE-luciferase plasmid while the RAR agonist TTNPB induced both aromatase and luciferase expression in these cells. Our results, which provide new data for <b>fenbuconazole,</b> as an inhibitor of human aromatase, and for eight pesticides as aromatase inducers, are discussed with regards to the regulation of aromatase expression in the JEG- 3 cellular context...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of several azole fungicides in aquatic environment has been recently reported but their endocrine effects in fish are poorly studied. The {{aim of the}} present study was to assess the effect of clotrimazole, a pharmaceutical fungicide, on expression of key target genes (StaR, cyp 17 a 1, cyp 11 b 2) involved in testicular steroidogenesis as well as on 11 - ketotestosterone (11 KT) biosynthesis. For that purpose, we first exposed adult male zebrafish to a wide range of clotrimazole concentrations(from 0. 01 uM to 0. 3 uM) for 7 days. In vivo exposure to clotrimazole resulted in an increase of cyp 17 a 1 and cyp 11 b 2 gene expressions in testis. To gain further information about the mechanism of action of clotrimazole, zebrafish testicular explants were exposed to similar concentrations of clotrimazole, with or without forskolin (FSK), an activator of the cAMP pathway that stimulates steroidogenesis. FSK (1 uM) strongly up-regulated cyp 17 a 1 and cyp 11 b 2 gene expressions and increased 11 KT release in the culture medium. Clotrimazole (0. 2, 1, and 5 uM), alone or in combination with FSK (1 uM), did not change basal or FSK-induced expression of cyp 17 a 1 and cyp 11 b 2. However, it inhibited both basal and FSK-induced 11 KT release ex vivo, suggesting it acted as an inhibitor of steroidogenic enzymes. In order to determine whether other compounds belonging to the azole family are able to elicit similar effect on testicular steroidogenesis as clotrimazole, two other azole fungicides known to contaminate aquatic environment were tested, <b>fenbuconazole</b> and propiconazole. We showed that exposure of male zebrafish for 7 days to <b>fenbuconazole</b> and propiconazole had no significant effects on steroidogenic gene expressions while ex vivo both azoles was able to inhibit the 11 KT release. Overall, our results show for the first time that the pharmaceutical fungicide clotrimazole is able to affect key steroidogenic genes expressions in a fish testis. However, the marked differences observed between in vivo and ex vivo experiments suggest that clotrimazole does not act directly on testes to regulate cyp 17 a 1 and cyp 11 b 2 transcription. Whatever, using the testis tissue explants model, we demonstrate a direct action of clotrimazole, and to a lesser extent propiconazole and <b>fenbuconazole,</b> on the gonad which results in inhibition of 11 KT synthesis. These original data deserve further studies on the effect of these compounds on fish reproductio...|$|E
40|$|The topical toxicities of five {{commercial}} grade pesticides commonly sprayed in apple orchards were estimated on adult worker honey bees, Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30 SG), l-cyhalothrin (Warrior II), dimethoate (Dimethoate 4 EC), phosmet (Imidan 70 W), and imidacloprid (Provado 1. 6 F). At least 5 doses of each chemical, diluted in distilled water, {{were applied to}} freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD 50 was imidacloprid, l-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, phosmet, and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD 50 was dimethoate, l-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide <b>fenbuconazole</b> (Indar 2 F) was also tested in a 1 : 1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture, the interaction of <b>fenbuconazole</b> (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide.

40|$|A {{method for}} the chiral {{separation}} of propiconazole, a triazole fungicide with two chiral centers, using cyclodextrin-modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC) with hydroxypropyl-Î³-cyclodextrin (HP-Î³-CD) as chiral selector was developed. The {{use of a}} mixture of 30 mM HP-Î³-CD, 50 mM SDS, and methanolâ€“acetonitrile 10 %: 5 % (v/v) in 25 mM phosphate buffer solution was able to separate two enantiomeric pairs of propiconazole. Stacking and sweeping-CD-MEKC under neutral pH (pH 7. 0) and under acidic condition (pH 3. 0) were used as two on-line preconcentration methods to increase detection sensitivity of propiconazole. Good repeatabilities in the migration time, peak area and peak height were obtained in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD). Sweeping-CDMEKC at acidic pH was found to give the highest sensitivity (100 -fold) and the method {{was applied to the}} chiral separation of propiconazole enantiomers and two other triazole fungicides, namely <b>fenbuconazole</b> and tebuconazole (triazole fungicides with one chiral center). The limits of detection for the three triazole fungicides ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 10 mg/L, which is well below the maximum residue limits (MRL) set by Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). Combination of solidphase extraction (SPE) pretreatment and sweeping-CD-MEKC procedure was applied to the determination of three triazole fungicides (<b>fenbuconazole,</b> tebuconazole and propiconazole) in grapes samples spiked at concentrations 10 â€“ 40 times lower than the MRL established by the CAC. The average recoveries of the selected fungicides in spiked grapes samples were good, ranging from 73 % to 109 % with RSD of 9 â€“ 12 % (n = 3). MEKC was also used for the separation of four fungicides (carbendazim, thiabendazole, propiconazole and vinclozolin). It was found that 20 mM formate buffer pH 7, 60 mM sodium cholate and 25 kV voltages gave the best condition for separation.

40|$|International audienceAromatase, a key steroidogenic {{enzyme that}} catalyses the {{conversion}} of androgens to estrogens, represent a target for endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of pollutants on aromatase enzymes in fish. In this study, we first optimized a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) microsomal aromatase assay to measure the effects of 43 substances belonging to diverse chemical classes (steroidal and non steroidal aromatase inhibitors, pesticides, heavy metals, organotin compounds, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) on brain and ovarian aromatase activities in vitro. Our results showed that 12 compounds were able to inhibit brain and ovarian aromatase activities in a dose-dependent manner with IC 50 values ranging from the low nM to the high uM range depending on the substance: steroidal and non steroidal inhibitors of aromatase (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione, androstatrienedione, aminogluthethimide), imidazole fungicides (clotrimazole, imazalil, prochloraz), triazole fungicides (difenoconazole, <b>fenbuconazole,</b> propiconazole, triadimenol), the pyrimidine fungicide fenarimol and methylmercury. Overall, this study demonstrates that rainbow trout brain and ovarian microsomal aromatase assay is suitable for evaluating potential aromatase inhibitors in vitro notably with respect to environmental screening.

Some mutagenic {{data are available}} on all 24 pesticides producing thyroid tumors. Mutagenicity {{does not seem to}} be a major determinant in thyroid carcinogenicity, except for possibly acetochlor; evidence is less convincing for ethylene thiourea and etridiazole. Studies on thyroid-pituitary functioning, including indications of thyroid cell growth and/or changes in thyroxine, triiodothyronine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, are available on 19 pesticides. No such antithyroid information is available for etridiazole, N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide, terbutryn, triadimefon, and trifluralin. Of the studied chemicals, only bromacil lacks antithyroid activity under study conditions.

40|$|Brown rot on {{cherry and}} plum, caused by Monilinia laxa, is an {{important}} disease, for which overwintered mummified fruit is a significant inoculum source for infection of flowers and fruit in the spring. Experiments were conducted to assess the potential of applying plant protection products in winter and/or early spring to suppress sporulation on mummified fruit. Products tested included Indar 5 EW (a commercial fungicide, a. i. <b>fenbuconazole),</b> Aureobasidium pullulans Y 126 [a candidate biocontrol agent (BCA) ]), Bacillus sp.

Indar and A. pullulans Y 126 significantly reduced sporulation when applied once in winter. Overall, a single treatment in early spring (February) was slightly more effective than single treatment in winter (November). Application of all products in both winter and early spring led to significant reduction in sporulation. Indar had the highest efficacy, {{reducing the number of}} spores from 9 [*]×[*] 105 to 5 [*]×[*] 103 per mummified plum when applied twice.

40|$|Management of {{tree fruit}} {{pathogens}} in Indiana relies upon {{the application of}} effective fungicides that may be compromised {{by the development of}} fungicide resistance, resulting in a significant economic impact to orchard fruit production. Testing for fungicide resistance is traditionally accomplished through the use of mycelial growth assays of the pathogen and compares the growth of isolates on fungicide-amended medium relative to the growth on non-amended medium. Although this assay can conclusively identify resistance to the fungicide in question, the results cannot be quickly determined and may take several weeks for recalcitrant fungi. Such delays in the determination of fungicide sensitivity prevent growers from identifying appropriate chemical management options within the same season. Furthermore, these tests are often costly in terms of material and labor such that, when they are offered to growers as a service, they are prohibitively expensive. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a faster method of testing for fungicide resistance in two common pathogens of fruit crops, Monilinia fructicola that causes brown rot of stone fruit and the causal agent of apple scab, Venturia inaequalis. To test for <b>fenbuconazole</b> fungicide resistance in M. fructicola, we modified a medically standardized biochemical assay that uses Alamar blue, a chromogenic substrate that can be used as an indicator of respiration, in a 96 -well microtiter format. We compared the AB method to traditional mycelial growth assays for resistance screening to <b>fenbuconazole.</b> Alamar blue can be used as a colorimetric test for fungicide resistance or quantitative tested with use of a plate reader. At this level, the isolates could be classified as resistant, shifted, or susceptible in as little as 24 hours. ^ The situation is quite different with V. inaequalis, which cannot be readily cultured late in the field season. Thus, if fungicide resistance is identified in the summer, determination of resistance may not occur until the following year. To circumvent the problem of pathogen isolation, we developed a screen that utilizes PCR in situ to detect Topsin-M® (thiophanate-methyl) resistance. To develop this screen, V. inaequalis isolates collected from Indiana were first screened with mycelium assays for thiophanate-methyl resistance. Isolates were found to range from sensitive (no growth at 0. 5 μg active ingredient (a. i) thiophanate-methyl/mL) to low resistance (growth at 0. 5 μg a. i. /mL but not 5 μg a. i. /mL) to medium resistance (growth at 5 μg a. i. /mL but not at 50 μg a. i. /mL) to very high resistance (rapid growth at 50 μg a. i. /mL). Concordance between known mutations in the β-tubulin gene and phenotype was determined to test the accuracy of a molecular assay. DNA was extracted from pure cultures and the β-tubulin gene was amplified and digested with restriction enzyme BstUI to verify a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at codon 198 that corresponded to very high fungicide resistance. 69 % of resistant isolates were positive for the polymorphism. Of the remaining 15 isolates that were scored as resistant but lacking the known RFLP, upon sequence analysis, we found that six of these isolates possessed a point mutation at codon 240 in the β-tubulin gene. This mutation can be differentiated by PCR-RFLP using Cac 8 I. Thus, all resistant isolates could be identified with the two restriction enzyme digests. These two PCR-based RFLP detection methods could be used to rapidly detect thiophanate-methyl resistant isolates of V. inaequalis. ...|$|E

Solvent extraction of pesticides was performed using a cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 + 1 v/v) mixture and the extract was cleaned-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using silica cartridges and elution with tetrahydrofurane. Separation of pesticides flusilazole, <b>fenbuconazole,</b> diniconazole, tebufenozide, famoxadone, trifloxystrobin and flufenoxuron was performed by gradient elution High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a microbore Hypersil HS C 18 column in 35 min total time, using mixtures of acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. Pesticides were detected and quantified at 210 nm with a variable-wavelength UV detector. Recoveries of pesticides from spiked samples, at 0. 05 - 2. 0 mg kg- 1 for apple and grape and at 0. 025 - 0. 250 mg L- 1 for wine, ranged from 82 to 107 % for apple and grape and from 87 % to 106 % for wine with RSD 12 %.

Among them, propiconazole (PPI), <b>fenbuconazole</b> (FB), clotrimazole (CLO) and ketoconazole (KTZ) {{have been shown to}} strongly inhibit ovarían aromatase activities but little is known about their potential effect on hormonal biosynthesis by male gonads. In this study, a recently developped zebrafish testicular explant culture system was used to assess their effect on biosynthesis of 11 - ketotestosterone (11 KT), a potent androgen in fish as well as on expression of some key steroidogenic genes (star, cyp 17 a 1, cyp 11 b). In this assay, fungicides were tested alone or in combination with forskolin (FSK, 1 uM), an activator of the cAMP pathway that stimulates steroidogenesis. After 6 days of ex vivo exposure to FSK, steroidogenic genes expression was strongly induced as well as 11 KT release in the culture medium. Interestingly, azole fungicides (0. 2 to 5 uM), alone or in combination with FSK did not changed basal or FSK- induced steroidogenic genes expression. However, they inhibited both the basal and FSK-induced 11 KT release. The ability of CLO and KTZ to inhibit 11 KT release occured at 1 uM while for FB and PPI significant inhibitions were observed only at 5 uM suggesting that these compounds were less active compared to CLO and KTZ. To conclude, the zebrafish testicular explant culture system was usefull to demonstrate the inhibitory action of azoles on 11 KT biosynthesis. Inhibition of 11 KT may rely on their ability to interact directly with steroidogenic enzymatic complex as inhibitors. The testicular explant culture system can serve as a tool to identify chemicals that disrupt sex steroid biosynthesi...|$|E

Results indicated that Geastrumia polystigmatis was the predominant species on apples, whereas Peltaster species were more common on reservoir hosts. Species distribution varied among sites. Phylogenetic analysis of 54 G. polystigmatis isolates revealed little genetic variability in the ITS region. The second set of objectives involved investigating the response of G. polystigmatis to changes in nutrition, temperature, heat stress, and relative humidity, and in vitro responses of G. polystigmatis and Peltaster fructicola to fungicides commonly used in orchards. Observation of growth on half-strength potato dextrose agar, malt extract agar, and 2 % water agar revealed that mycelial growth of G. polystigmatis was thicker and more melanized in the presence of readily available carbohydrates. Temperature range experiments demonstrated that the optimum temperature for growth was approximately 24 ºC. The fungus was able to survive exposure to 32 ºC for at least one week, 37 ºC for at least 48 hours, and 42 ºC for at least 8 hours. Growth was optimum at 99 - 100 % relative humidity. Isolates of P. fructicola were very sensitive to thiophanate-methyl, mancozeb, cyprodinil, penthiopyrad, <b>fenbuconazole,</b> and trifloxystrobin. Isolates of G. polystigmatis were sensitive to thiophanate-methyl and cyprodinil, but significantly less sensitive to all other fungicides than P. fructicola.
