We show that mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I with small molecule CP 2 reduces levels of amyloid beta and phospho-Tau and averts cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> three animal <b>models</b> of familial AD. Low-mass molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical studies confirmed that CP 2 competes with flavin mononucleotide for binding to the redox center of complex I leading to elevated AMP/ATP ratio and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in neurons and mouse brain without inducing oxidative damage or inflammation. Furthermore, modulation of complex I activity augmented mitochondrial bioenergetics increasing coupling efficiency of respiratory chain and neuronal resistance to stress. Concomitant reduction of glycogen synthase kinase 3 ? activity and restoration of axonal trafficking resulted in elevated levels of neurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins in adult AD mice. Our results suggest that metabolic reprogramming induced by modulation of mitochondrial complex I activity represents promising therapeutic strategy for AD. © 2015.

The model allows for permanent and transitory effects of disasters that unfold over multiple years. It also allows the timing of disasters to be correlated across countries.

40|$|AbstractAccording to World Health Organization estimates, type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) is {{an epidemic}} (particularly in under development countries) and a socio-economic challenge. This is even more relevant since increasing evidence points T 2 D as {{a risk factor for}} Alzheimer's disease (AD), supporting the hypothesis that AD is a “type 3 diabetes” or “brain insulin resistant state”. Despite the limited knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and the etiological complexity of both pathologies, evidence suggests that neurodegeneration/death underlying cognitive dysfunction (and ultimately dementia) upon long-term T 2 D may arise from a complex interplay between T 2 D and brain aging. Additionally, decreased brain insulin levels/signaling and glucose metabolism in both pathologies further suggests that an effective treatment strategy for one disorder may be also beneficial in the other. In this regard, one such promising strategy is a novel successful anti-T 2 D class of drugs, the glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) mimetics (e. g. exendin- 4 or liraglutide), whose potential neuroprotective effects have been increasingly shown in the last years. In fact, several studies showed that, besides improving peripheral (and probably brain) insulin signaling, GLP- 1 analogs minimize cell loss and possibly rescue cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>models</b> of AD, Parkinson's (PD) or Huntington's disease. Interestingly, exendin- 4 is undergoing clinical trials to test its potential as an anti-PD therapy.

40|$|Water table depth (WTD) {{effects on}} net {{ecosystem}} CO 2 exchange of boreal peatlands are largely mediated by hydrological effects on peat biogeochemistry and the ecophysiology of peatland vegetation. The lack of representation of these effects <b>in</b> carbon <b>models</b> currently limits our predictive capacity {{for changes in}} boreal peatland carbon deposits under potential future drier and warmer climates. We examined whether a process-level coupling of a prognostic WTD with (1) oxygen transport, which controls energy yields from microbial and root oxidation–reduction reactions, and (2) vascular and nonvascular plant water relations could explain mechanisms that control variations in net CO 2 exchange of a boreal fen under contrasting WTD conditions, i. e., shallow vs.  deep WTD. Such coupling of eco-hydrology and biogeochemistry algorithms in a process-based ecosystem model, ecosys, was tested against net ecosystem CO 2 exchange measurements in a western Canadian boreal fen peatland {{over a period of}} drier-weather-driven gradual WTD drawdown. A May–October WTD drawdown of [*]∼[*]  0. 25  m from 2004 to 2009 hastened oxygen transport to microbial and root surfaces, enabling greater microbial and root energy yields and peat and litter decomposition, which raised modeled ecosystem respiration (R e) by 0. 26  µmol CO 2  m − 2  s − 1 per 0. 1  m of WTD drawdown. It also augmented nutrient mineralization, and hence root nutrient availability and uptake, which resulted in improved leaf nutrient (nitrogen) status that facilitated carboxylation and raised modeled vascular gross primary productivity (GPP) and plant growth. The increase <b>in</b> <b>modeled</b> vascular GPP exceeded <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>modeled</b> nonvascular (moss) GPP due to greater shading from increased vascular plant growth and moss drying from near-surface peat desiccation, thereby causing a net increase <b>in</b> <b>modeled</b> growing season GPP by 0. 39  µmol CO 2  m − 2  s − 1 per 0. 1  m of WTD drawdown. Similar increases in GPP and R e caused no significant WTD effects on modeled seasonal and interannual variations in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). These modeled trends were corroborated well by eddy covariance measured hourly net CO 2 fluxes (modeled vs.  measured: R 2  [*]∼[*]  0. 8, slopes [*]∼[*] 1  ±  0. 1, intercepts [*]∼[*] 0. 05  µmol m − 2  s − 1), hourly measured automated chamber net CO 2 fluxes (modeled vs.  measured: R 2  [*]∼[*] 0. 7, slopes [*]∼[*] 1  ±  0. 1, intercepts [*]∼[*] 0. 4  µmol m − 2  s − 1), and other biometric and laboratory measurements. Modeled drainage as an analog for WTD drawdown induced by climate-change-driven drying showed that this boreal peatland would switch from a large carbon sink (NEP [*]∼[*]  160  g C m − 2  yr − 1) to carbon neutrality (NEP [*]∼[*]  10  g C m − 2  yr − 1) should the water table deepen by a further [*]∼[*] 0. 5  m. This <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> projected NEP indicated that a further WTD drawdown at this fen would eventually lead to a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> GPP due to water limitation.

We investigated the influence of seizure frequency on cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> a rodent <b>model</b> for temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Neurobehavioral assessment was performed before and after surgery, after the induction of self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus (SSLSE), and in the chronic phase in which rats experienced recurrent seizures. Furthermore, we assessed potential confounders of memory performance. Results: Rats showed a deficit in spatial working memory after the induction of the SSLSE, which endured in the chronic phase. A progressive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> recognition memory developed in SSLSE rats. Confounding factors were absent. Seizure frequency and also {{the severity of the}} status epilepticus were not correlated with the severity of cognitive deficits. Significance: The effect of the seizure frequency on cognitive comorbidity in epilepsy has long been debated, possibly because of confounders such as antiepileptic medication and the heterogeneity of epileptic etiologies. <b>In</b> an animal <b>model</b> of temporal lobe epilepsy, we showed that a decrease in spatial working memory does not relate to the seizure frequency.

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed, and exploring the role of inflammation, we recently reported the role of IL- 1 β in the hippocampus after surgery in mice with postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Here, we show that TNF-α is upstream of IL- 1 and provokes its production in the brain. Peripheral blockade of TNF-α is able to limit the release of IL- 1 and prevent neuroinflammation and cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> a mouse <b>model</b> of surgery-induced cognitive decline. TNF-α appears to synergize with MyD 88, the IL- 1 /TLR superfamily common signaling pathway, to sustain postoperative cognitive decline. Taken together, our results suggest a unique therapeutic potential for preemptive treatment with anti-TNF antibody to prevent surgery-induced cognitive decline...|$|R
40|$|Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the {{entorhinal cortex}} (EC) {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} pathological hallmarks in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It can occur before significant Aβ deposition and appears to "spread" into anatomically connected brain regions. To determine whether this early-stage pathology is sufficient to cause disease progression and cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> experimental <b>models,</b> we overexpressed mutant human tau (hTauP 301 L) predominantly in layer II/III neurons of the mouse EC. Cognitive functions remained normal in mice at 4, 8, 12 and 16 months of age, despite early and extensive tau accumulation in the EC. Perforant path (PP) axon terminals within the dentate gyrus (DG) contained abnormal conformations of tau even in young EC-hTau mice, and phosphorylated tau increased with age in both the EC and PP. In old mice, ultrastructural alterations in presynaptic terminals were observed at PP-to-granule cell synapses. Phosphorylated tau was more abundant in presynaptic than postsynaptic elements. Human and pathological tau was also detected within hippocampal neurons of this mouse model. Thus, hTauP 301 L accumulation predominantly in the EC and related presynaptic pathology in hippocampal circuits was not sufficient to cause robust cognitive deficits within the age range analyzed here...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies how {{international}} {{real interest}} rate shocks can drive business cycles in an emerging economy. We first present evidence that, in emerging economies, {{real interest rate}}s and real estate prices are negatively correlated and real interest rates are countercyclical. Motivated by this evidence, we develop {{a model of a}} small open economy, where entrepreneurs are borrowing constrained and domestic lenders are lending constrained, with both constraints tied to real estate values. We demonstrate that a positive interest rate shock leads to a fall in real estate prices and, through the credit constraints, to a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> output. The <b>model</b> is calibrated to data from Argentina. Simulation results show that our model can match the countercyclicality of real interest rates and the output pattern better than a model with the borrowing constraint but without the lending constraint...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, {{integrations}} with {{a common}} design have been undertaken with eleven different climate models to compare {{the response of the}} Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) to time-dependent climate change caused by increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Over 140 years, during which the CO 2 concentration quadruples, the circulation strength <b>declines</b> gradually <b>in</b> all <b>models,</b> by between 10 and 50 %. No model shows a rapid or complete collapse, despite the fairly rapid increase and high final concentration of CO 2. The models having the strongest overturning in the control climate tend to show the largest THC reductions. <b>In</b> all <b>models,</b> the THC weakening is caused more by changes in surface heat flux than by changes in surface water flux. No model shows a cooling anywhere, because the greenhouse warming is dominant...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the global}} {{context of the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> wild species, <b>modeling</b> the {{distribution}} of populations is a crucial aspect of ecological management. This can be a major challenge, especially for species, such as the European eel, that have complex life cycles, exhibit cryptic behavior, or migrate over long distances. A {{review of the literature}} suggests that eel size data could be used to assess and analyze freshwater distribution of eel. We argue that analyses based on small yellow eels (≤ 300 mm) along the longitudinal course of rivers could provide a valuable tool for population monitoring. We propose a standardized catchment recruitment index and a colonization index based on the probability of occurrence (presence/absence data) using logistic models for different size classes. The model developed here provides a convenient guide for assessing yellow eel stages in freshwater areas, and should have concrete applications for management of the species...|$|R
