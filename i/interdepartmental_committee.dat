[...] Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of No.3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, from Squadron Leader Frank Lukis on 13January 1930. At this time, the position of No.3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base. Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail. In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Richard Williams, arrived for an inspection and found the base to be {{in such a state}} of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as [...] "an almighty dressing down", threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up. Having handed over to Squadron Leader Bill Bostock on 22November 1931, Cobby was promoted to wing commander on 1May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence. [...] In this position he headed an <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>committee</b> that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately {{led to the formation of}} the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No.1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of Queensland and the Northern Territory provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World WarII. Restless in the inter-war years, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as Australian Airmen and Popular Flying. His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection, the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.|$|E

[...] He is committed to maintaining the status quo for the country in general and for the Civil Service in particular, and will stop at nothing to do so—whether that means baffling his opponents with technical jargon, employing a dizzying array of stalling and delaying tactics, withholding information or concealing vital documents in mammoth piles of papers and reports, strategically appointing allies to supposedly impartial boards, or setting up an <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>committee</b> to immobilise his Minister's proposals with red tape, and occasionally outright lying.

The National Disaster Management Framework (NDMF) that followed in 2005 put clear guidelines in place for implementing the DMA and emphasised the importance of the integration and coordination of DRM activities in all spheres of government.

This rationalization process begun in March 1979 to restructure the states decision making process. It would centralize the power with the prime minister and sideline the cabinet and parliament. A cabinet secretariat was created in the Office of the Prime Minister, with the reduction of Vorster's twenty cabinet advisory committees to four under PW Botha as decision making bodies not advisory, not accountable to the cabinet. These would be the committees of National Security, Constitutional, Economic and Social Affairs, each under a minister appointed by the Prime Minister. The National Security committee would manage the SSC and the National Security Management System, with its decisions not having to be ratified by the Cabinet and only informed of them if required by the Prime Minister. The SSC's strategy was managed by thirteen to fifteen <b>Interdepartmental</b> <b>Committees</b> and implemented through fifteen internal and external Joint Management Centre's.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Since 1994, {{fundamental}} transformation {{has taken}} place in South Africa in terms of disaster risk management. The transformation processes have led to the promulgation of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No 57 of 2002) that was heralded as a new era for disaster risk management in South Africa. Subsequently, the publication of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework (of 2005) provides a set of clear guidelines on the implementation of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No 57 of 2002). The National Disaster Risk Management Framework underscores the significance of the integration and co-ordination of disaster risk management activities in all levels of government in South Africa. This emphasises the fact that Disaster risk management in South Africa has been established as a public sector function within each sphere of government. In its KPA 1, the framework further emphasis the establishment of integrated disaster risk management structures by each sphere of government. The disaster risk management structures, such as <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>committees</b> and a district forum have not yet been established in the Capricorn District Municipality. In cases where other structures have been established, the main challenge is the participation of all role players and the inconsistency in the representation of local municipality in those structures. Another gap is the lack of clear responsibility of disaster risk management in some of the internal key role players. This dissertation aims to evaluate the implementation of the institutional capacity for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Capricorn District Municipality. This dissertation caters for the reader within the theory of organisation. Subsequently, the disaster risk management structures were discussed, based on the requirements of both the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No 57 of 2002) and a National Disaster Risk Management Framework policy document (of 2005). This dissertation made use of the one-on-one semi-structured interviews for data collection in the field of disaster risk management within the Capricorn District Municipality. As regards recommendations, this dissertation suggests a number of points that the Capricorn District Municipality needs to implement in order to fast-track the establishment of disaster risk management structures that could lead to progress in meeting the legislative mandate of Disaster Risk Reduction.
