2500|$|There {{were two}} {{production}} {{models of the}} RE5, the 1975 M model [...] and the 1976 [...] "A" [...] model, which adopted more conventional styling. [...] Many [...] "A" [...] models were converted M models. The main changes for 1976 included a color changes, GT750-style instruments, blinkers, tail lights and <b>headlight</b> <b>housing.</b> The [...] "B" [...] secondary points for overrun were removed on the [...] "A" [...] model, the chain oiler was removed and a sealed drive chain fitted. By {{the end of the}} production run, a total of some 6,000 [...] RE5 machines had been produced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} given a mild {{facelift}} in 2006, during which the front indicators were moved from the front bumper, up into the <b>headlight</b> <b>housing</b> and only a 2.0 L four cylinder diesel engine is available in two states of tune; a [...] or [...] mated to a six speed manual or optional automatic transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Senior Packards {{received}} a new grille texture and multi-tone paint schemes. The cars also {{received a}}n altered <b>headlight</b> <b>housing,</b> {{with a slightly}} longer hood stretching over the headlight, {{as well as a}} more distinctive egg-crate grille over 1955. All '56 senior Packards moved the Packard crest {{to the front of the}} hood, leaving the [...] "circle-V" [...] emblem in the grille looking somewhat bare.|$|E
50|$|The Firesweep was a lower-priced entry which {{combined}} a Dodge {{shell and}} chassis with a DeSoto bumper and grill. 1957 models were sold only as imports in Canada.While the Firesweep featured DeSoto's signature tailfins, the front clip (the front section, {{forward of the}} firewall) {{was based on the}} Dodge Coronet. The most telling feature was the <b>headlight</b> design, <b>housed</b> under heavily chromed lids typical of Dodge. Firesweep grilles were similar to those on other contemporary DeSoto models.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{aggressive}} front fascia was added {{thanks to a}} Nissan Skyline inspired front bumper for 2002 models. Black <b>housing</b> <b>headlights,</b> fog-lights, sideskirts, a rear spoiler, a dual-tip muffler, and 16" [...] aluminum-alloy wheels were also standard. This trim also featured a sport-tuned suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and sport seat cloth.|$|R
50|$|For the 2004-2006 model years, no {{significant}} cosmetic changes {{were added to}} differentiate the SE-R model, although it still retained its side-skirt extensions, rear spoiler, black <b>housing</b> <b>headlights</b> and newly designed wheels. The 2004 model year also featured a new style of tail-light which {{is reminiscent of the}} Skyline GT-R's quadruple taillights. Volcanic Orange, an exclusive color for the SE-R and Spec V trim was available for 2004-2006 models.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} system in all {{six years of}} the XL175 was a six volt system and included a battery, headlight with high/low beam, turn signals, brake/taillight, instrumentation lights, and a horn. A warning light panel was also included on models 1976 through 1978 which displayed lights for 'High Beam' (blue light), 'Turn Signal' (orange light) and 'Neutral' (green light). Models from 1973 through 1975 incorporated warning lights for neutral and turn signals into the tachometer face, and a high beam indicator light {{on the top of}} the <b>headlight</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

50|$|During {{the nine}} years of production, 1956-1965, a total of 91,400 Junak {{motorcycles}} were produced. Several models were produced, namely: 10,000 tourist M07, rally M07-R and cross M07-C models, 2500 three-wheeled B20’s, 8500 sidecars type WB1 and W03 while the rest were M10 models. The Junak frame was produced by SFM in Szczecin while the engines were made by ZSM in Łódź. During the transition from model M07 to M10 from 1960 to 1961 about 20,000 M10 models possessed some characteristics of the M07 model such as the <b>headlight</b> <b>housing.</b> These are called the transition or in Polish “przejsciowka” models.|$|E
50|$|The LVTP-7 {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1972 {{as a replacement for}} the LVTP-5. In 1982, FMC was contracted to conduct the LVTP-7 Service Life Extension Program, which converted the LVT-7 vehicles to the improved AAV-7A1 vehicle by adding an improved engine, transmission, and weapons system and improving the overall maintainability of the vehicle. The Cummins VT400 diesel engine replaced the GM 8V53T, and this was driven through FMC's HS-400-3A1 transmission. The hydraulic traverse and elevation of the weapon station was replaced by electric motors, which eliminated the danger from hydraulic fluid fires. The suspension and shock absorbers were strengthened as well. The fuel tank was made safer, and a fuel-burning smoke generator system was added. Eight smoke grenade launchers were also placed around the armament station. The <b>headlight</b> clusters were <b>housed</b> in a square recess instead of the earlier round type. The driver was provided with an improved instrument panel and a night vision device, and a new ventilation system was installed. These upgraded vehicles were originally called LVT-7A1, but the Marine Corps renamed the LVTP-7A1 to AAV-7A1 in 1984.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, the US {{export market}} led Royal Enfield {{to develop a}} 692 cc, {{overhead}} valve twin capable of 100 mph, which was launched as the Meteor. The engine was basically a modified 500 twin crankcase with 350 single (Bullet) pistons, valves and identical 90mm stroke length. In 1954, the Super Meteor was updated and fitted with a new cast alloy <b>headlight</b> nacelle (casquette) <b>housing</b> the speedometer, ammeter and light switch. During 1955, the dynamo and coil ignition was replaced with a Lucas magdyno. This model {{was replaced by the}} Super Meteor in 1956 that sported a brand new frame. Based on the Royal Enfield Meteor Minor 496 cc overhead valve engine, the new model had a strengthened crank and improved clutch. The frame was also strengthened to handle the increased torque. The gearbox was modified so that the gear shift lever was concentric with the kick-starter. The compression ratio was increased to 7.25:1; it was upgraded with Lucas alternator and Amal Monobloc carburettor. Modified engines, incorporating electric start, were also produced and supplied by the factory for the Berkeley B95 and B105 car models during 1959 and 1960. The Super Meteor and the sporty Constellation were replaced by the 736 cc Royal Enfield Interceptor in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|The BMW R60/6, R75/6, R90/6 and {{the sport}} model BMW R90S form {{a range of}} boxer twin {{motorcycles}} that were manufactured in Berlin, Germany, by BMW from 1974 to 1976. The [...] "slash six" [...] models departed from the earlier [...] "slash five" [...] slightly. First, the smallest displacement changed from 500cc to 600cc. A sport model was offered, as were disc brakes (front only) for the first time. Additionally, the tank design was changed to remove the chrome trim panels (rubber knee pads were added instead), and the gauge pod was moved from the <b>headlight</b> <b>housing</b> to its own assembly over the housing.|$|E
5000|$|For 1955, {{the entire}} senior line of Packards {{received}} an extensive design update that freshened the last restyling {{that was done}} in 1951. Under designer Richard A. Teague, the Senior Packards received a more modern grille design, [...] "Cathedral"-styled rear tail lights, hooded headlight housings and a new exterior trim layout that afforded Packard the ability to offer two- and three-tone paint combinations with the simplest of masking patterns. While Packard could not afford a whole new greenhouse for the passenger compartment, new trim {{at the base of}} the rear pillar made it look like it had a redesigned roofline. The cars were also outfitted with a wrap-around windshield, thus bringing it in line with American automobiles of the era. Inside, upholstery and bright work was also freshened and the cars received a new dashboard layout faced with a machined-look stainless steel facing.For 1955, the Patrician was offered as a four-door sedan only and Packard produced 9,127 of the cars. Changes for 1956 included a revised <b>headlight</b> <b>housing</b> that exaggerated the front peak further forward. The area around the headlight was painted black to give the effect of greater depth. The car also received a different grille texture. During the 1956 model year, 3375 Patricians rolled off Packard's production line before the model was dropped by the ailing carmaker.|$|E
5000|$|... 6051 was {{delivered}} in the Daylight paint scheme, with Farr-Aire intake grilles, a Pyle National Gyralight in the upper <b>headlight</b> <b>housing,</b> nose MU connections, dynamic braking, Nathan model M5R24 air horn (it currently sports a Nathan P5), a single Model 4740 steam generator producing 4500 lb. of steam per hour, a 1200 gal fuel tank, a 1350 gal boiler water tank, automatic transition, and a freight pilot. It weighed 336,000 lb and had 56,600 lb of Starting Tractive Effort. Gear ratio was 55:22, with the Locomotive Overspeed set at 83 mph. In May 1958, SP 6051 was painted in the experimental black with orange nose [...] "halloween" [...] paint scheme. It received the gray and scarlet [...] "bloody nose" [...] paint scheme shortly afterward, likely in 1959. SP 6051 was retired on December 24, 1969 and was donated to the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society {{at the end of}} the year along with Baldwin DRS-6-6-1500 5208 and EMD F7A 6402, largely through the efforts of SP Vice President Larry Hoyt. All three units were in turn deeded to the California State Railroad Museum on June 22, 1978 and placed on display near the Sacramento train station or stored at SP's Sacramento General Shops until the California State Railroad Museum was built. SP 6051 was cosmetically and mechanically restored in the early 1980s and is in its original 1955 appearance in the Daylight paint scheme. SP 6051 was also part of the 1981 [...] "Railfair" [...] festivities to celebrate the opening of the California State Railroad Museum.|$|E
