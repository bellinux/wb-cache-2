The main reactor design features are presented which are necessary for calculations. It is shown {{that the type of}} fertile nuclides has no virtual effect on the formation of the neutron flux density spectrum. The contribution of each neutron group to the fission reaction rate at the design <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> content of 18. 6 % is determined. The dependences of average values of macroscopic fission cross-sections, absorption of fissile nuclides and radiation capture of fertile nuclides on the <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> content in nuclear fuel are obtained. Averaging of cross-sections was carried out over neutron flux density spectra. As a result, dependences were obtained of the effective neutron multiplication factor and breeding ratio on the fissile isotope content for various fuel compositions of uranium and thorium cycles at the KLT- 40 S campaign start-up. In terms of the effective multiplication factor, the best result is obtained in the 232 Th+ 233 U composition when the fissile isotope content is more than 5 %, and in the 238 U+ 239 Pu composition when the the fissile isotope content is less than 5 %. In terms of the breeding ratio, the best result is obtained in the 232 Th+ 235 U composition when the fissile isotope content is up to 10 %; if it exceeds 10 %, its values are relatively the same for the 232 Th+ 233 U and 232 Th+ 235 U and 238 U+ 235 U compositions. Thus, the most efficient composition at the nuclear fuel campaign start-up is 232 Th+ 233 U with the 233 U nuclide content more than 5 % due to very high values of the effective neutron multiplication factor...|$|E
40|$|Delayed neutron {{precursors}} {{have traditionally}} been represented by six groups. The group yields and decay constants are obtained from nonlinear fits to delayed neutron emission rates obtained experimentally. Each fit to the data produces different set of group decay constants based on the statistical precision of the instruments used and on the time domain used. As a result, standard data libraries contain different sets of group decay constants for each fissionable nuclide based on the nonlinear least squares fit. The group decay constants for thermal and fast fission of the same <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> are also different. The advantages of using a single set of decay constants for all isotopes facilitate the analysis to cores that have different type of fissionable materials. This and other advantages have been discussed by several authors. Cahalan and Ott, 1973 developed six group formulations with fixed decay constants for fast fission of 8 different nuclide. A simpler transformation is used in this work to demonstrate that fixed decay constant formulations can easily be developed and differences in reactivity introduced by the transformation are very small. The seven decay constants used for this demonstration are not optimal or recommended in any sense.

40|$|Thorium, {{which is}} a <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide,</b> was {{considered}} as a fuel for nuclear power plants {{in the beginning of}} the nuclear era. Then it was more or less forgotten for 30 - 40 years but is now gaining renewed, increased interest. There are several reasons for the fact that thorium was abandoned, and some of them are actually reasons for taking it up again today. One reason is the production of plutonium in the traditional uranium cycle. In the beginning this was desired (e. g., for weapons production) while today many nations want to limit the amounts of plutonium for nonproliferation reasons. Other reasons for abandoning thorium as a nuclear fuel are the difficulties in reprocessing, as the oxide is highly insoluble. This, however, can be an advantage for a once-through nuclear fuel cycle where the used nuclear fuel is placed untreated in a final repository. In addition, thorium is more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium, making it possible to run nuclear power using the once-through cycle considerably longer. Whether this is good or bad is in the eye of the beholder. All in all, there are several pros and cons of using thorium as a fuel. They have all been known for more than 50 years, but due to changes in politics and general opinion some of them have become more or less important. In this chapter, both the recovery of virgin material as well as use and reprocessing of thorium-based nuclear fuel will be discussed in detail.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The United States nuclear {{industry}} is under significant public pressure {{to close the}} nuclear fuel cycle. Closing the fuel cycle will require that nuclear waste, fission products and transuranics, except plutonium (actinides), be disposed of by permanent burial.

This paper will describe criteria for design of special reactors to fission actinides {{as well as new}} reactors that do not produce actinides. This paper concluded that the single most important consideration when designing a reactor to burn actinides, or not produce, actinides is to maintain as hard a neutron spectrum (mostly high energy neutrons) as possible to fission the actinides and not produce new actinides. To maintain a hard neutron spectrum, the use of U- 238 and the use of non-fuel nuclides (oxygen, carbon, molybdenum, sodium, steel) should be minimized.

40|$|The {{potential}} of utilization of natural uranium without enrichment and reprocessing {{has been shown}} by using nuclear equilibrium theory [1]. The meaning of “without enrichment and reprocessing ” is that any additional fissile materials are not required after its operation is started and after the second reactor, though initial fissile inventory is required,. In this system continuous refueling operation is employed and two types of fast reactors are investigated. The neutron economy is key issue to realize this system. When we consider parasitic neutron absorption and required burnup excess reactivity are considerable, the realization of this system becomes marginal. The hard spectrum is preferable to realize this system, and metallic fuel is employed. Lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) is employed as coolant from safety point of view, though gas shows the better neutron economic performance. The group cross section set is generated with SRAC code system [2] using JENDLE- 3. 2 library [3]. For the fast trial Self-Fuel-Providing Reactor (SFPR) [4] has been investigated. The design parameters are shown in Table 1. The fuel volume fraction is set {{much higher than the}} conventional design to improve neutron economy. Core cooling becomes a difficult job. Feasibility studies on such reactor show that one of the primary difficulties of the reactor design is to provide power distribution as flat as in conventional reactors, since the <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> concentration of fuel assembly in SFPR is very different each other. For this optimization a modified method of Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed. The optimized results show some relations between excess reactivity and power peaking. For peak fuel burnup of 22. 5 % and power peaking factor of 1. 5 the peak excess reactivity becomes 2. 15 %. To realize these values a complicated fuel-shuffling scheme should be employed...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} taking {{credit for the}} {{reduction}} in reactivity of burned or spent nuclear fuel (SNF) due to fuel burnup is {{commonly referred to as}} burnup credit. The reduction in reactivity that occurs with fuel burnup is due to the net reduction of <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> concentrations and the production of actinide and fission-product neutron absorbers. The change in the inventory of these nuclides with fuel burnup, and the consequent reduction in reactivity, is dependent upon the depletion environment. Therefore, the use of burnup credit necessitates consideration of all possible fuel operating conditions, including the use of integral burnable absorbers (IBAs). The Interim Staff Guidance on burnup credit [1] issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Spent Fuel Project Office recommends licensees restrict the use of burnup credit to assemblies that have not used burnable absorbers (e. g., IBAs or burnable poison rods, BPRs). This restriction eliminates {{a large portion of the}} currently discharged spent fuel assemblies from cask loading, and thus severely limits the practical usefulness of burnup credit. The reason for this restriction is that the presence of burnable absorbers during depletion hardens the neutron spectrum, resulting in lower {sup 235 }U depletion and higher production of fissile plutonium isotopes. Enhanced plutonium production has the effect of increasing the reactivity of the fuel at discharge and beyond. Consequently, an assembly exposed to burnable absorbers may have a slightly higher reactivity for a given burnup than an assembly that has not been exposed to burnable absorbers. This paper examines the effect of IBAs on reactivity for various designs and enrichment/poison loading combinations as a function of burnup. The effect of BPRs, which are typically removed during operation, is addressed elsewhere [2]...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to- and method for characterization of <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> contaminated soils and process piping {{has been developed}} and implemented for low and intermediate level wastes, using new calibration bases for photon counting. The method has been validated by integrating the capabilities of MCNP 5 and ISOCS for a LaBr scintillator detector in combination with known radioactive standards. In addition, the developed methods consider nuclear safety as the priority while retaining realistic fissile mass and enrichment estimation techniques. The impact of a quick, portable non-destructive assay process to the decommissioning and remediation arena is extremely valuable. Traditional methods have inherent limitations in time consumption, resources, stability, and rigidity. In addition to optimizing a material blending and storage program, gaining a real-time understanding {{to the nature of}} fissile material prior to disturbance aids a nuclear safety program and culture invaluably. In this dissertation, detailed detector-waste models were developed and utilized to create a quick uranium mass and enrichment estimation process by taking advantage of the resolution and discrimination capabilities of the LaBr equipped InSpector 1000 instrument. The analysis takes into account multiple possible scenarios that may be encountered during decommissioning and remediation of a fuel fabrication and buried nuclear waste facility, while keeping nuclear safety controls in mind. As an inherent part of the process, the models were validated by performing a series of code-to-software and software-to-standard benchmarking procedures, which provided substantiation for use of the detector for the derived purposes, in addition to ensuring that the Monte Carlo-based calibration approach was conservative, as compared to other methods. The scenarios analyzed for the calibration basis were selected based on historical knowledge and in-field experience at the Westinghouse Hematite Decommissioning Project. The techniques developed in this dissertation offer a new characterization method for fissile material quantity and enrichment with a portable, passive non-destructive gamma assay system without relying on continual macroscopic system analysis. In addition, it provides early detection of large quantities of fissile material prior to exhumation or disturbance to enhance nuclear safety processes. This places the first priority on nuclear and radiological safety while preserving the time and money saving aspects of production-based projects...|$|E

A fit to the calculated minimum critical mass data using the extended criticality parameter {{is the basis of}} the revised method. The solution density (grams/ liter) for the minimum critical mass is also obtained by a fit to calculated values. Input to the calculation consists of the Maxwellian averaged fission and absorption cross sections and the thermal values of nubar.

40|$|AbstractRapid {{nondestructive}} assay {{methods for}} trace fissile material analysis {{are needed in}} both nuclear forensics and safeguards communities. To address these needs, research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory High Flux Isotope Reactor Neutron Activation Analysis facility has developed a generalized nondestructive assay method to characterize materials containing fissile isotopes. This method relies on gamma-ray emissions from short-lived fission products and makes use of differences in fission product yields to identify fissile compositions of trace material samples. Although prior work has explored the use of short-lived fission product gamma-ray measurements, the proposed method {{is the first to}} provide a complete characterization of isotopic identification, mass ratios, and absolute mass determination. Successful single fissile isotope mass recoveries of less than 6 % recovery bias have been conducted on standards of 235 U and 239 Pu as low as 12 ng in less than 10 minutes. Additionally, mixtures of fissile isotope standards containing 235 U and 239 Pu have been characterized as low as 198 ng of fissile mass with less than 7 % recovery bias. The generalizability of this method is illustrated by evaluating different fissile isotopes, mixtures of fissile isotopes, and two different irradiation positions in the reactor. It is anticipated that this method will be expanded to characterize additional <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides,</b> utilize various irradiation facilities, and account for increasingly complex sample matrices...|$|R
40|$|Damaged fuels {{originated}} from the accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, and the spent nuclear fuels from commercial light water reactors (LWRs) in Japan {{are considered to}} be disposed of in deep geological repository. For a prospective repository, as part of generic performance assessment, a criticality safety assessment (CSA) should be performed to ensure that the repository system including the engineered barriers and host geological formations remains sub-critical for tens of thousands to millions of years. For various repository concepts, CSA is considered to include three major stages in chronological order: (1) the stage before package failure, (2) the stage after package failure, while <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> remain within the engineered barrier system (EBS) and in the near-field region, and (3) the stage in which <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> {{originated from}} multiple packages are deposited in far-field host rocks. Defining the model for neutronics calculations plays a central role in CSAs, where conservative assumptions are usually made to cope with various uncertainties and to simplify the model. The aim of this dissertation is to develop neutronics models for different stages in the criticality safety study, and provide basic understandings for the long-term criticality safety for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel in geologic repository. In the near-field analysis, a neutronics model has been developed for a system consisting of a canister containing fuel debris from Fukushima reactors and the surrounding buffer, in a water-saturated deep geological repository. The fuel debris has been modeled as a hexagonal lattice of spherical fuel particles. Following key observations have been concluded from the numerical results: (a) the calculated neutron multiplicity (keff) is sensitively dependent on assumptions related to moderation, (b) the carbon steel canister {{plays an important role in}} reducing the potential for criticality, (c) the maximum keff of the canister-buffer system could be achieved after a fraction of <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> been released from the canister, and (d) under several assumptions, the maximum keff of the canister-buffer system could be principally determined by the dimension and composition of the canister, not by the initial fuel loading. Based on the preliminary results and findings, a parametric study has been made to identify the optimized lattice parameters for criticality. And the critical mass of damaged fuels for a single canister has been calculated. If this critical mass is used as the maximum canister mass loadings, roughly a thousand canisters are needed to contain the damaged fuels from the three damaged cores. For the LWR spent fuels, a parametric study has been performed to examine spent fuels with different designs and burnup histories. The numerical results indicate that, under the conditions assumed, for all UO 2 spent fuels and most of the MOX spent fuels, the single canister model will always be subcritical. The far-field study has been focusing on neutronic analysis to examine the criticality conditions for uranium depositions in geological formations which result from geological disposal of damaged fuels from Fukushima reactors. Neutronics models are used to evaluate the keff and critical mass for various combinations of host rock and geometries. The present study has revealed that the planar fracture geometry applied in the previous criticality safety assessment for geological disposal would not necessarily yield conservative results against the homogeneous uranium deposition. It has been found that various far-field critical configurations are conceivable for given conditions of materials and geological formations. Prior to knowing the site location, some important points for selecting a site for criticality safety can be suggested. These include: (a) iron existing in the host rock reduces the likelihood of criticality significantly; (b) low host rock porosity is preferred for criticality safety; (c) the conservatism could change when comparing heterogeneous geometries for different fracture apertures; and (d) the importance of the mass of the deposition increases when it is smaller. As part of the improvement for the models developed in the far-field analysis, preliminary works on uranium depositions in randomly fractured rocks have been presented. The randomly fractured geometry could fundamentally influence the far-field criticality, because the system’s keff value sensitively depends on the fracture aperture and the depositions at fracture intersections. No previous work has been made to study the effect of random geometry in the context of the long-term criticality safety in a geologic repository. Different numerical schemes have been developed and compared for the direct sampling of uranium depositions in randomly fractured rocks using MCNP. A general literature review of existing methods for neutron transport problems with random processes has been made. And the analytical Feinberg-Galanin-Horning (FGH) method has been derived and tested for a numerical example...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to devise a method for utilizing the ORIGEN-S computer code to calculate the activation products generated in in-core experimental assemblies at the MIT Research Reactor (MITR-II). ORIGEN-S is a nuclear depletion and decay analysis code. It accounts for all types of nuclear reactions and eliminates the need for selection of the dominant reactions that will occur in a given experiment, as must be done with the existing activity calculation method. It is expected that the new approach will be easy to use, and will produce radioactivity estimations that are generally more accurate than those produced by the existing method. The ORIGEN-S method has been developed and tested for four experiments that have been or are scheduled to be irradiated in the MITR. These experiments are the Advanced Cladding Irradiation (ACI), High Temperature Irradiation Facility (HTIF), Electric Power Research Institute Electro-Chemical Potential (EPRI ECP) loop, and Annular Fuel Test Rig (AFTR). The method has also been used to perform activation analyses for ten individual elements (plus U- 235 and U- 238) that are commonly found in MITR in-core experiment (ICE) assemblies. The ORIGEN-S analyses for the ACI, HTIF, and EPRI ECP experiments produced results that were relatively similar to the results produced by previous analyses that utilized the current method of activation estimation. This is because the thermal neutron capture reactions, which are major contributors to the activation of these experiments, are already well accounted for in the existing method. The results of the ORIGEN-S analysis for the AFTR, which contains fissile material, were also very similar to the results of the previous analysis, despite the fact that the previous analysis accounted for changes in flux due to <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclide</b> depletion during irradiation and the current analysis did not. It is concluded that the activation calculation method developed should be generally adequate for all experiments irradiated in the MITR core. A possible exception involves experiments containing quantities of fissile material larger than the quantities contained in the AFTR, as these experiments could produce significant changes in neutron flux levels that would render this method inadequate. by Edward M.

The SCALE/TRITON (Standardized Computer Analyses for Licensing Evaluation / Transport Rigor Implemented with Time-dependent Operation for Neutronic Depletion) code system has been used to simulate boiling water reactor (BWR) operating conditions in order to investigate nuclide densities in UNF and how the use of control rod blades affect nuclide densities found in UNF. Rodded and unrodded operating cases for a fuel assembly have been used as bounding cases and are used as reference solutions in a piecewise data approximation methodology (PDA method). A variety of control blade insertion patterns have been used with the PDA method and simulated in TRITON in order to observe trends in nuclide densities with varying control blade use. The PDA method is compared with TRITON simulated data in order to evaluate the validity and accuracy of the PDA method. The PDA method gives very accurate results for <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> but is insufficient in treating densities as a function of burnup for fission products and fertile nuclides.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to derive {{quadrature}} formulas for nuclear reactor kinetic equations {{in the form of}} Volterra integral equations of the second kind and reactimeter equations in the form of integral convolution, the kernel of which is a decay function of delayed neutron precursors (DNP) in the non-group form. The expediency of the transition to integral equations is caused by the unification of the direct (calculation of power dynamics) and the reverse (calculation of current reactivity) tasks of reactor kinetics. As a result, the solution is reduced to the calculation of the delayed neutrons integral (DNI). This eliminates the source of computational-experimental discrepancies in estimations of reactivity, which is due to the difference in computational algorithms of direct and inverse problems. The paper describes a general scheme for converting different transport equation approximations to describe the contribution of delayed neutrons by means of an integral convolution without using dynamic equations of the DNP concentration. This conversion reduces the model dimension, simplifies the software implementation, eliminates the stiffness problem of differential kinetic equations and provides the stability of calculations. The model dimension is preserved in the case of several <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides.</b> The integral form of the equations makes it possible to use the experimental decay function in quadrature formulas, which can be identified in the operating conditions of a nuclear reactor and stored pointwise in a nongroup form without decomposition into the sum of exponentials. This eliminates the need to solve the non-linear problem of identifying group parameters of delayed neutrons and increases the adequacy of modeling. A series of quadrature formulas for the calculation of the DNI are obtained and the corresponding algorithms of a digital reactimeter and numerical simulation of the reactor kinetics are described...|$|R
40|$|Temporally-correlated neutron counting, {{including}} the passive neutron coincidence counting (PNCC) and passive neutron multiplicity counting (PNMC) techniques, {{is widely used}} at nuclear fuel cycle facilities for the non-destructive assay (NDA) of plutonium (Pu). Correlated event rates are used to quantify mass values of spontaneously <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> and derive total Pu mass. These methods are limited in accuracy by uncertainty in the deadtime correction. A pulse train analysis method has been developed and applied to the re-evaluation of deadtime correction factors for correlated neutron counting. The Monte-Carlo transport code MCNPXTM was used to generate a time-stamped list of neutron captures in 3 He. Event times were processed in software to create neutron pulse trains akin to list mode data. The action of multiplicity shift register (MSR) electronics was modeled in software to analyse these pulse trains. Prior to MSR analysis, stored pulse trains could be perturbed in software to apply the effects of deadtime. In this work, an updating (paralyzable) deadtime model was chosen to replicate existing theoretical approaches to deadtime correction. Traditional deadtime correction methods for temporally-correlated neutron counting {{have been found to}} be accuracy limiting in cases where highly correlated rates occur over a short coincidence gate width i. e. high instantaneous rates associated with high multiplicity bursts. Here, empirical results are presented which support the development of an alternative formulism for both the traditional Singles and Doubles deadtime correction factors for PNCC. Deadtime effects are found to be dependent on the level of correlation in the pulse train yet independent of gate fraction, which is set by the shift register gate structure, for Singles deadtime correction factors. Doubles deadtime correction factors were found to have a slight dependence on gate fraction.

5000|$|Especially {{energetic}} alpha particles {{deriving from}} a nuclear process are {{produced in the}} relatively rare (one in a few hundred) nuclear fission process of ternary fission. In this process, three charged particles are produced from the event instead of the normal two, with {{the smallest of the}} charged particles most probably (90% probability) being an alpha particle. Such alpha particles are termed [...] "long range alphas" [...] since at their typical energy of 16 MeV, they are at far higher energy than is ever produced by alpha decay. Ternary fission happens in both neutron-induced fission (the nuclear reaction that happens in a nuclear reactor), and also when fissionable and <b>fissile</b> actinides <b>nuclides</b> (i.e., heavy atoms capable of fission) undergo spontaneous fission as a form of radioactive decay. In both induced and spontaneous fission, the higher energies available in heavy nuclei result in long range alphas of higher energy than those from alpha decay.|$|R
40|$|Globally {{the most}} used nuclear fuel {{material}} is uranium(IV) oxide (UO 2) {{and it is}} produced by powder metallurgical processing. Powders are first compacted into cylindrical pellets, which are subsequently sintered at high temperature to increase their density. The UO 2 nuclear fuel cycle is also inseparable from wet-chemical routes: uranium is leached from ore bodies and is further purified via, for example, ion exchange or solvent extraction techniques. Additionally, used nuclear fuel can be reprocessed to separate the elements which contain <b>fissile</b> <b>nuclides</b> (U, Pu) from the fission products. Such reprocessing involves the dissolution of used fuel. Ultimately, the compounds produced via wet-chemical routes −irrespective of their nature, “fresh” or reprocessed− are converted into fine oxide powders. UO 2 powder shows a tendency to react with oxygen, especially if the grains have a high specific surface area. Uncontrolled uptake of oxygen is usually undesirable in the fuel production stage, and in very fine UO 2 powders exposure to normal air at room temperature may even lead to a pyrophoric reaction. Passivation treatments are required to decrease the reactivity of such UO 2 powders. Additionally, if oxidation can proceed continuously the higher oxide U 3 O 8 is formed, and this crystallographic transformation {{is associated with a}} volume increase of about 36 %. Such a volume increase can result in rupture of storage containers or vessels when not accounted for. Evidently, the reactivity of UO 2 towards oxygen may pose a risk. Despite continued research in this domain the oxidation process is still not completely understood, especially in fine powders and at low temperatures (< 100 °C). In this PhD thesis the reaction between UO 2 and oxygen has been investigated under conditions related to nuclear fuel production and to storage of UO 2 powders and pellets. The research focused on assessing the crystal structure of the different phases which are formed, and also evaluated the mechanisms and kinetics involved in the oxidation reaction. Results of this study allow {{a better understanding of the}} issues related to UO 2 oxidation, and can be applied to improve the handling of UO 2 powders and to evaluate the effects of storage conditions.

40|$|Criticality {{predictability}} applications require as input {{the best}} available information on <b>fissile</b> and other <b>nuclides.</b> In recent years important work has been performed {{in the analysis of}} neutron transmission and cross-section data for fissile nuclei in the resonance region by using the computer code SAMMY. The code uses Bayes method (a form of generalized least squares) for sequential analyses of several sets of experimental data. Values for Reich-Moore resonance parameters, their covariances, and the derivatives with respect to the adjusted parameters (data sensitivities) are obtained. In general, the parameter file contains several thousand values and the dimension of the covariance matrices is correspondingly large. These matrices are not reported in the current evaluated data files due to their large dimensions and to the inadequacy of the file formats. The present work has two goals: the first is to calculate the covariances of group-averaged cross sections from the covariance files generated by SAMMY, because these can be more readily utilized in criticality predictability calculations. The second goal is to propose a more practical interface between SAMMY and the evaluated files. Examples are given for {sup 235 }U in the popular 199 - and 238 -group structures, using the latest ORNL evaluation of the {sup 235 }U resonance parameters...|$|R
