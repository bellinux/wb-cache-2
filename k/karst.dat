5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are <b>karst</b> habitats which include submerged <b>karst,</b> such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; {{it has always been}} the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by <b>Karst</b> and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but <b>Karst</b> and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E

It also is found in France and Switzerland, where it is considered to be critically endangered. More to the south, it occurs in Spain and Portugal, although the species is restricted to <b>karst</b> springs in Central Portugal.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of endemic species that they support and the high threats they are facing, such as {{unsustainable}} limestone quarrying, hunting and urbanization, limestone <b>karsts</b> are recognized as biodiversity hotspots needing urgent protection. The first aim of our study was to investigate the mammal rodent diversity of Thai limestone <b>karsts.</b> Our second aim was to examine the diversity at a finer scale than the species level (intraspecific biodiversity) using phylogeographic approaches. Therefore, we studied the phylogeographic structure of a threatened rodent, endemic to limestone <b>karsts</b> of Thailand, the Murinae Leopoldamys neilli. We sampled 76 limestone <b>karsts</b> in whole Thailand and live-trapped 444 rodents including 115 Leopoldamys neilli.

Our results highlight the importance of protecting limestone habitats to preserve not only their interspecific but also intraspecific rodent diversity that is highly threatened as more than 20 % of limestone <b>karsts</b> in Thailand have already been quarried. Management plans of limestone, a non-renewable resource, should urgently take into account this high biological importance of <b>karsts...</b>|$|R
30|$|Despite their {{remarkable}} biodiversity, however, a great {{proportion of}} <b>karsts</b> {{remain to be}} explored and very little is known regarding the evolutionary processes that have generated the marvelous floras on these limestone landscapes (Clements et al. 2006). Since Begonia {{is one of the}} best represented plant groups on tropical limestone <b>karsts</b> (Clements et al. 2006), it provides an important model for understanding the role that limestone <b>karsts</b> have played in generating high species diversity and endemism.|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{landscape}} falls into types determined by the underlying geology. These landscapes are the limestone <b>karst</b> and lias of the north, the central clay vales and wetlands, the oolites of the east and south, and the Devonian sandstone of the west.|$|E
5|$|The four-storey {{building}} is externally austere. A freestanding cube, the main façade faces Republic Square and is inlaid with <b>Karst</b> marble, with green Oplotnica granite below each window. The only decorative element is the two storey main portal – four oak doors surrounded by statues by Zdenko Kalin and Karel Putrih which represent working people.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the <b>karst</b> would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal <b>karst</b> drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are tropical dry forests, subterranean habitats (other than caves), and man-made <b>karsts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone <b>karst</b> areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of <b>karst</b> landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other <b>karst</b> features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1942, the Waffen-SS {{formed a}} company {{intended}} for anti-partisan {{operations in the}} rugged and high-altitude border region between Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia known as the <b>Karst.</b> SS-Standartenführer (Colonel) Hans Brand, a geologist and speleologist, suggested {{the creation of the}} unit. The company was formed at the SS training centre in Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian).|$|E

5|$|The Široka Kula {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 41 civilians {{in the village of}} Široka Kula near Gospić, Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence. The killings began on 13 October 1991 and continued until late October. They were perpetrated by the Croatian Serb SAO Krajina police and generally targeted ethnic Croat civilians in Široka Kula. Several victims were ethnic Serbs suspected by the police of collaboration with Croatian authorities. Most of the victims' bodies were thrown into the Golubnjača Pit, a nearby <b>karst</b> cave.|$|E
5|$|There are 37,000 known {{species in}} Croatia, but their actual number is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia {{in the first half of}} the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and <b>karst</b> rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has 38,226 known taxa, 2.8% {{of which}} are endemic; the actual number (including undiscovered species) is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and <b>karst</b> rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. Indigenous cultivars of plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating <b>karst</b> topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E
5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. <b>Karst.)</b> J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent gills, and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} a synonym of M.cinerella.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with <b>karst</b> areas, and basalt formations.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a relict humid <b>karst</b> area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests that the past environment in northwestern Madagascar was also more humid. Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded from some other localities in northwestern Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} {{characters}} serve as Felix's antagonists in The Lost Age. He {{is at odds}} with the heroes of the original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus Adept warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury Adept named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars Adept warriors, <b>Karst</b> and Agatio. They keep the pressure on Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|The main upland {{areas are}} the Mendip Hills in the {{northeast}} and the Quantock Hills further west. The Mendips run west to east between Frome and Weston-super-Mare, overlooking the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the River Avon to the north. They culminate in the promontory of Brean Down, only to crop up again in the Bristol Channel as the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. Steep Holm is part of Somerset while Flat Holm is the most southerly point of Wales. The Mendips are composed of Carboniferous Limestone and water erosion has created gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and caves as well as various <b>karst</b> features.|$|E

40|$|Limestone <b>karsts</b> {{are highly}} {{threatened}} biodiversity hotspots supporting {{high levels of}} endemic species. <b>Karsts</b> are patchy distributed within Southeast Asia and their isolation from one another give them the features of “islands on the continent” and has important consequences for the genetic structure of endemic taxa. In present study, we have studied the phylogeography of Neill’s Rat Leopoldamys neilli, a threatened Murinae rodent species endemic to limestone <b>karsts</b> of Thailand, {{on the basis of}} two mitochondrial markers, two nuclear fragments, as well as twelve microsatellite loci. Our study gave evidence of a complex and strong geographic structure of the genetic diversity for L. neilli. Several highly differentiated genetic lineages were observed throughout Thailand. These results suggest a severe fragmentation of L. neilli’s populations, correlated to the fragmented distribution of its habitat and highlight its high endemicity to limestone <b>karsts.</b> The evolutionary history of L. neilli was investigated using Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and our results suggest that the current phylogeographic pattern of this species result from several deep vicariant events during Plio-Pleistocene. To conclude, this study revealed an unexpected high level of intraspecific diversity within L. neilli. These results consolidate the importance to strengthen the protection of limestone habitats and to preserve not only their high interspecific but also intraspecific diversity...|$|R
