40|$|Nocturnal {{precipitation}} {{cells and}} lines occur near the coastline {{in the whole}} Mediterranean basin in all seasons. The precipitation events are mainly located in areas where coastal mountain ranges and rivers enhance convergence though the interaction of nocturnal mesoscale and local flows (land breeze, katabatic and <b>drainages</b> <b>winds)</b> with prevailing synoptic wind or with other mesoscale and local flows. The methodology used here to study this phenomenon consists of three stages. First, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) radar satellite database is used to detect nocturnal precipitation near the coastline, from 18 to 09 UTC. An event {{is included in the}} study if the 3 hours accumulated precipitation detected by TRMM is stationary near the coast, or has moved slightly onshore or offshore, and has lasted no more than six consecutive hours. Second, the NCEP reanalysis database is used to describe the synoptic conditions and to discard precipitation associated with synoptic events (large low pressure areas, dynamic polar fronts, or troughs, for example). In the final step by using the version 3 of the Weather Research Forecast model, we simulate and analyse some of the selected events to determine the role of the land sea temperature differences, the curvature of the coastline and the sea surface temperature. The simulations confirm that the nocturnal precipitation studied in the Mediterranean basin near the coastline is formed from the interaction between relatively warm and wet sea-air with the cold air mass from <b>drainage</b> <b>winds,</b> {{as well as from the}} convergence of several <b>drainage</b> <b>winds</b> offshore.

The latter model tends to produce slightly faster <b>drainage</b> <b>winds</b> over East Antarctica. The intensity of the katabatic winds produced by MM 4 is sensitive to parameterizations of boundary layer fluxes. Two simulations performed with MM 4 using analyses from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for June 1988 as initial and boundary conditions. A simulation of the period from 000 UTC 2 June to 0000 UTC 8 June produces realistic synoptic phenomena including ridge development over East Antarctica, frontogenesis over the Amundsen Sea, and a katabatic surge over the Ross Ice Shelf.

The results of the simulations provide detailed features of the Antarctic winter boundary layer along the steeply sloping terrain. Highest boundary layer wind speeds averaged over the month-long simulation are approximately 20 m/s. The lack of latent heating in the simulations apparently results in some bias in the results.

The scale in which coastal fronts occurs in the West Mediterranean basin (WMB) is investigated by using remote sensing instruments (weather radar and satellite) and mesoscale numerical simulations by using the WRF model. Two types of atmospheric dynamic forming coastal fronts in the WMB are noticed in this area Nocturnal coastal fronts develop within the meso-beta and meso-gamma scales during the night when <b>drainage</b> <b>winds</b> move offshore the inland cold air (Mazon and Pino, 2013, 2014).

40|$|The {{variation}} in the oft-observed, thermally-forced, nocturnal katabatic winds along {{the east side of}} the Rocky Mountains can be explained by either internal variability or interactions with various other forcings. Though generally katabatic flows have been studied as an entity protected from external forcing by strong thermal stratification, this work investigates how <b>drainage</b> <b>winds</b> along the Colorado Front Range interact with, in particular, topographically forced mountain waves. Previous work has shown, based on measurements taken during the Atmospheric Studies in Complex Terrain 1993 field program, that the actual dispersion in katabatic flows is often greater than reflected in models of dispersion. The interaction of these phenomena is complicated and non-linear since the amplitude, wavelength and vertical structure of mountain waves developed by flow over the Rocky Mountain barrier are themselves partly determined by the evolving atmospheric stability in which the drainage flows develop. Perturbations to katabatic flow by mountain waves, relative to their more steady form in quiescent conditions, are found to be caused by both turbulence and dynamic pressure effects. The effect of turbulent interaction is to create changes to katabatic now depth, katabatic flow speed, katabatic jet height and, vertical thermal stratification. The pressure effect is found to primarily influence the variability of a given katabatic now through the evolution of integrated column wave forcing on surface pressure. Variability is found to occur on two scales, on the mesoscale due to meso-gamma scale mountain wave evolution, and on the microscale, due to wave breaking. Since existing parameterizations for the statically stable case are predominantly based on nearly flat terrain atmospheric measurements under idealized or nearly quiescent conditions, it is no surprise that these parameterizations often contribute to errors in prediction, particularly in complex terrain...|$|R

Estimates of daily pan evaporation using the mass transfer equations derived from the Lake Hefner and Lake Mean water-loss investigations were found to over-estimate and under-estimate for different types of exposures. The errors in the daily estimates were related to the type of exposure and stability indices. Revised mass transfer equestions were found to correlate well with daily and 2 -hourly pan evaporation rates when type of exposure was considered.

The Green takes <b>drainage</b> from the <b>Wind</b> River Range of west-central Wyoming, from Utah's Uinta Mountains, and from the Rockies of northwestern Colorado. The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater area than the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities. Both the Gunnison and San Juan rivers, which derive most of their water from Rocky Mountains snowmelt, contribute more water than the Gila did naturally.|$|R
40|$|Blanket peat {{catchments}} {{are important}} biodiversity refugia. Key pressures on peatland catchment water bodies include artificial <b>drainage,</b> forestry, over-grazing, <b>wind</b> farm development and climate change, {{and assessment of}} these pressures requires sensitive monitoring programmes. This study, undertaken in two neighbouring blanket peat catchments, examined the variability in macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages and related indices in response to spatial and seasonal variability. Multivariate analysis revealed significant trends in the taxa distribution of both groups and the indices downstream {{and away from the}} constraining influence of the peat. However, the ecological quality ratios and status assessments for the associated water bodies were consistent irrespective of spatial variability in assemblages and raw indices. Significant seasonal trends emerged only in the macroinvertebrate assemblages and indices. This study contributes to the understanding of sources of uncertainty in ecological assessment and thus provides valuable information for the calibration of assessment protocols for sensitive peatland catchments...|$|R
40|$|Wind erosion in Lithuania, as {{also the}} {{neighbouring}} Baltic countries, occurs mainly {{in areas where}} the natural plant cover has been replaced by agriculture. In the years of Soviet power, the formation of vast continuous tilled fields (up to 1000 ha) and extinction of agroplantations and individual farmsteads, contributed greatly to intensification of wind erosion. As a result of soil <b>drainage</b> and <b>wind</b> erosion (the wind no longer meets obstacles on its way) in some years up to several tons of light soils would be blown out in a few days (e. g., 1982, 1988, 1989). A group of scientists from the Institute of Geography in Vilnius (R. Morkunaite, S. Paskauskas, M. Beconis, V. Minkevicius, headed by the author of the present article) investigated the processes of wind erosion in 1986 - 1991. The field investigations were carried out using various sediment samplers [2, 3]. These investigations were supplemented by a physical modeling of wind erosion processes in the wind tunnel [1]. From the data obtained a mathematical model was worked out, which expresses the dependence of wind erosion on the major determining factors: D = - 1798 ± 450 v- 357 g- 105 h- 45 m where wind erosion coefficient (R) = 0. 69, D is the volume of blown soil, t/ha/h; v = wind speed, m/s; g = diameter of equivalent soil aggregates, mm; h = humus, %; m = content of physical clay...|$|R
