60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the edge}} again. Dian was {{almost at the}} bottom. I could see Juag {{standing}} just beneath her with his hands upstretched to assist her.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} and back at him, was near showing him my pistol, and the expression changed in his eyes. He hung perplexed at me. Then with a grunt he went on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> them, and {{saw that}} they really were of a very great value and rarity from a {{pathological}} point of view: bloated organs, gaping cysts, distorted bones, odious parasites--a singular exhibition of the products of India.|$|E
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} <b>I</b> can see him. And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets {{me with an}} expression---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} {{enough to tell}} me that all is well at home,' <b>I</b> answered, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> my father's letter. 'But how came these things?' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> nodded, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the typewritten pages. [...] "Andrew Hibbard. Instructor in {{psychology}} at Columbia. It was on October twentieth, a Saturday, that’s {{two weeks ago}} today." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder. She was {{perfectly}} right. It {{was a man}} beyond all doubt, the figure on the wagon. Yet the hand was Aunt Emma's, every line and every stroke of it; except, of course, the scars. Those, I saw at a glance, were wholly wanting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{skipping}}. But {{we stopped}} skipping at once, and took to running {{as hard as}} we could. We both ran through some soft reedy ground, where the brute overtook us. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder and saw him knock Quin into the rushes and set his enormous foot on him--" ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{place was}} {{taken at the}} communion rails. Hearing a {{cautious}} step behind me, <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman, evidently--was advancing up the chancel. The service began. The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was fascinated}} by it myself. Every moment <b>I</b> had to <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder. <b>I</b> {{was looking at him}} when a voice outside the door said: ...|$|R
40|$|As I {{write this}} sentence, <b>I</b> am <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> at the color printer sitting beside my screen. In the popular jargon of the {{computer}} industry, that printer is called a &quot;peripheral&quot;—which, upon reflection, is a rather odd way to describe it. What, precisely, is it peripheral to? If the ultimat...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never more so. Take a {{favourable}} {{moment to}} speak to the good soul, as an old acquaintance; she remembers you well, and by a little of that interrogating management you possess, a favourable opportunity may occur to bring in the other subject. In the mean time, <b>I</b> will <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the pages of this book." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder, and {{my heart}} jumped against my ribs. There, right behind me, was {{the glow of the}} camp-fire. The current had turned at right angles, {{sweeping}} round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is all so horrible," [...] said Grace, bending {{back her}} head, so that as <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} I {{could see her}} firm white neck through the laces as she stared upward at the streak of blue sky so far above. Then she turned her face toward me again, {{and it seemed to}} my excited fancy that it had grown ethereal.|$|E
60|$|Hearing a soft footfall, <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder, {{to see the}} Mexican that I {{had noticed}} at the station. He was coming from across the street. I {{wondered}} if he were watching me. He might be. My heart began to beat violently. Turning once again, I discovered that the fellow could not {{be seen in the}} pitchy blackness. Then I broke into a run.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, boys, I've a {{word for}} Snecker," [...] I called, quite loud. Nobody stirred. <b>I</b> swept my <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the crowd, but did not see Snecker. [...] "I'm in some hurry," [...] I added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "he was. <b>I</b> find, in <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the will, which was newly made on Flora's marriage, {{that he has}} remembered Norman--left him £100 and his {{portfolio}} of prints by Raffaelle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one {{correspondent}} {{who is a}} sure draw, Watson. That is the bank. Single ladies must live, {{and their}} passbooks are compressed diaries. She banks at Silvester's. <b>I</b> have <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her account. The last check but one paid her bill at Lausanne, {{but it was a}} large one and probably left her with cash in hand. Only one check has been drawn since." ...|$|R
60|$|Hooja's fleet {{had been}} in much more compact {{formation}} when we sighted them this time than on the occasion following the tempest. Now they were moving rapidly in pursuit of us, all well within the radius of a mile. Five of them were leading, all abreast, and were scarce two hundred yards from us. When <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder I {{could see that the}} archers had already fitted arrows to their bows in readiness to fire upon us the moment that they should draw within range.|$|E
6000|$|Hot mutton chops, fried chicken, omelettes, fried {{potatoes}} and coffee --all excellent. This was {{the bill of}} fare. It was sauced with a savage appetite purchased by hard riding the day before, and refreshing sleep in a pure atmosphere. As I called for a second cup of coffee, <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder, and behold our white village was gone--the splendid tents had vanished like magic! It was wonderful how quickly those Arabs had [...] "folded their tents;" [...] and it was wonderful, also, how quickly they had gathered the thousand odds and ends of the camp together and disappeared with them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the rail, and I {{saw what}} she meant. There was her Charlie, dancing about {{all over the}} floor {{as if he had just}} {{discovered}} that he hadn't lived till then. I saw him say something to the girl he was dancing with. I wasn't near enough to hear it, but I bet it was 'This is the life!' If I had been his wife, in the same position as this kid, I guess I'd have felt as bad as she did, for if ever a man exhibited all the symptoms of incurable Newyorkitis, it was this Charlie Ferris.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> back <b>over</b> the dreary {{waste of}} ages, I see many a glimmering and mark that is {{familiar}} to my memory. And oh, the leagues I have travelled! the things I have seen! the events I have helped to emphasise! I was at the assassination of Caesar. I marched upon Mecca with Mahomet. I was in the Crusades, and stood with Godfrey when he planted the banner of the cross on the battlements of Jerusalem. I--" ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{work does}} not take the pain away. I may be diving for my own {{pleasure}} or showing others how to do so, but when I return to the shop, it seems empty without you. I stock and order as I always did, but even now, <b>I</b> sometimes <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder without thinking and call for you. As I write this note to you, I wonder when, or if, things like that will ever stop.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{dangerous}} to read in a sorcerer's books," [...] said he with a smile, though his countenance was uneasy and displeased. [...] "Georgiana, there are pages in that volume which <b>I</b> can scarcely <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> and keep my senses. Take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door of the}} Red Room and {{the steps}} up to it were in a shadowy corner. I moved my candle {{from side to side}} in order to see clearly the nature of the recess in which I stood, before opening the door. Here it was, thought I, that my {{predecessor}} was found, and the memory of that story gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder at the black Ganymede in the moonlight, and opened the door of the Red Room rather hastily, with my face half turned to the pallid silence of the corridor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Et vous, mademoiselle-donnez-moi le votre," [...] {{continued}} I, more mildly, {{addressing a}} little pale, plain looking girl {{who sat in}} the first row of the other division, and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest and the most attentive in the room; she rose up, walked over to me, and delivered her book with a grave, modest curtsey. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the two dictations; Eulalie's was slurred, blotted, and full of silly mistakes--Sylvie's (such {{was the name of the}} ugly little girl) was clearly written, it contained no error against sense, and but few faults of orthography. I coolly read aloud both exercises, marking the faults--then I looked at Eulalie: ...|$|E
60|$|I left Mr. Thompson before ten, {{and took}} {{my way through the}} sloppy streets to the Athenaeum, where I looked over the {{newspapers}} and periodicals, and found two of my old stories (Peter Goldthwaite and the Shaker Bridal) published as original in the last London Metropolitan! The English are much more unscrupulous and dishonest pirates than ourselves. However, if they are poor enough to perk themselves in such false feathers as these, Heaven help them! <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the stories, and they seemed painfully cold and dull. It is the more singular that these should be so published, inasmuch as the whole book was republished in London, only a few months ago. Mr. Fields tells me that two publishers in London had advertised the Scarlet Letter as in press, each book at a shilling.|$|E
6000|$|My friend laughed heartily, {{as if he}} saw {{into and}} enjoyed my motives and my confusion. [...] "Safe?--it came safe enough," [...] he said. [...] "The wind of the world always blows its vanities into haven. But {{this is the end}} of the session, when I have little time to read any thing printed except Inner-House papers; yet if you will take your kail with us next Saturday, <b>I</b> will <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> your work, though I am sure I am no {{competent}} judge of such matters." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> involuntarily <b>over</b> my shoulder. Braster Grange {{was a long}} grim pile of buildings, {{which had}} been unoccupied for many years. Between it and the sea was nothing but empty marshland. It {{was one of the}} bleakest spots along the coast--to the casual {{observer}} nothing but an arid waste of sands in the summer, a wilderness of desolation in the winter. Only those who have dwelt in those parts are able to feel the fascination of that great empty land, a fascination potent enough, but of slow growth. Mr. Moyat's remark was justified.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> {{my notes}} and {{records of the}} Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and {{interesting}} features {{that it is no}} easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it {{in spite of the fact}} that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{sufficiently}} embarrassing situation. I {{put on a}} bold front, however, and not deigning to answer, pushed past him and walked with as much leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which Nick had taken. As I turned the corner <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder, and in the darkness I {{could just make out}} the man standing where I had left him. In great uneasiness I pursued my way, my imagination summing up for Nick all kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences. I walked for some time--it may have been half an hour--aimlessly, and finally decided {{it would be best to}} go back to Madame Bouvet's and await the issue with as much calmness as possible. He might not, after all, have caught the fellow.|$|E
60|$|Later in {{the morning}} I {{received}} a surprise of a totally different sort. Following the cook’s instructions, I had gone into Wolf Larsen’s state-room to put it to rights and make the bed. Against the wall, near {{the head of the}} bunk, was a rack filled with books. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> them, noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare, Tennyson, Poe, and De Quincey. There were scientific works, too, among which were represented men such as Tyndall, Proctor, and Darwin. Astronomy and physics were represented, and I remarked Bulfinch’s Age of Fable, Shaw’s History of English and American Literature, and Johnson’s Natural History in two large volumes. Then {{there were a number of}} grammars, such as Metcalf’s, and Reed and Kellogg’s; and I smiled as I saw a copy of The Dean’s English.|$|E
60|$|I {{went out}} by myself with my {{thoughts}} into the night. It was a chilling night, and rare spots of rain were falling. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder at the}} lit windows of the Lords. I walked, I remember, westward, and presently came to the Grosvenar Embankment and followed it, watching the glittering black rush {{of the river and}} the dark, dimly lit barges round which the water swirled. Across the river was the hunched sky-line of Doulton's potteries, and a kiln flared redly. Dimly luminous trams were gliding amidst a dotted line of lamps, and two little trains crawled into Waterloo station. Mysterious black figures came by me and were suddenly changed to the commonplace at the touch of the nearer lamps. It was a big confused world, I felt, for a man to lay his hands upon.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} why it was. But I could never write to them, or think of them, or even read the paper they gave me though it lay in my drawer for months, in Italy, and <b>I</b> often <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> six lines of it. And often, often my mind went back to the group, the play they were rehearsing, the wine in the {{pleasant}} café, and the night. But the moment my memory touched them, my whole soul stopped and was null; I could not go on. Even now I cannot really consider them in thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems {{surprising}} to me," [...] I observed, [...] "that during the <b>glance</b> <b>I</b> cast <b>over</b> the declaration, {{or whatever it}} is termed, of Mr. Morris, he should never have mentioned that Campbell was in his company when he met the marauders." ...|$|R
60|$|This! letter gave me {{a dreadful}} shock. Remembering our {{adventure}} in London, and his conduct there; remembering how liable he was to yield to the most sudden, crazy, and contrary impulses; and that, as a friendless, penniless foreigner in New York, {{he must have had}} the most terrible incitements to committing violence upon himself; I shuddered to think, that even now, while I thought of him, he might no more be living. So strong was this impression at the time, that <b>I</b> quickly <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the papers to see if there were any accounts of suicides, or drowned persons floating in the harbor of New York.|$|R
