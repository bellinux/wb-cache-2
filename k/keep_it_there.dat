25|$|The Big Show wasn't quite {{big enough}} to put {{television}} in its place and <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep it alive longer than two years might also {{have been due to}} the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including The Jack Benny Program (directly opposite The Big Show), Amos 'n' Andy and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. But The Big Show is remembered {{as one of the great}} final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium.|$|E

[...] It also {{provides}} hysteresis to prevent short heating cycles, {{as the temperature}} must be raised several degrees before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a mercury switch {{on the end of}} the bimetal coil. [...] The weight of the mercury {{on the end of the}} coil tends to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>there,</b> also preventing short heating cycles. [...] However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently toxic nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as chemical waste.|$|E

He writes {{of the history of the}} land, its buildings and people, having met and painted many of the protagonists in the campaign, including both Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk and Dost Mohammad Khan. He realised the impossibility of controlling a country like Afghanistan in his line “Like Sisyphus, we have rolled up the huge stone to the top of the mountain, and if we do not <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>there,</b> our labour will be lost”. The same year Atkinson published Sketches in Afghaunistan, a folio of 25 tinted lithographed plates showing the topography and landscapes of Afghanistan and the Punjab creating an important record of “what was then an unexplored country”. Atkinson had planned a second volume but the 'worked up' paintings were lost at sea en route to his British publisher where they were to be engraved; the original sketches he had prepared on the spot however are in the British Library.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} for the control of discrete-time piecewise affine hybrid systems on full-dimensional polytopes. The new strategy is divided into a local and a supervisory control problem. The local problem is to reach and cross one facet of a polytope ensuring that the next sample of the time-discrete trajectory is picked up in the adjacent polytope. Therefore, a local piecewise affine control law is obtained by solving an optimization problem, minimizing the retention period of the trajectory in the polytope or the quadratic sum of the input signal. This procedure is based on system inherent bounds. The supervisory control problem is to find a suitable combination of polytopes and local control strategies that transfers the trajectory to the operating point and <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R
