5000|$|A {{bank engine}} (United Kingdom/Australia) (colloquially a banker) or <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> or pusher engine (North America) is a railway {{locomotive}} that temporarily assists a train that requires additional power or traction {{to climb a}} gradient (or bank). Helpers/bankers are most commonly found in mountain divisions (called [...] "helper districts" [...] in the U.S.), where the ruling grade may demand the use of substantially greater motive power than that required for other grades within the division.|$|E
40|$|Technology scaling trends {{have forced}} {{designers}} to consider alternatives to deeply pipelining aggressive cores with {{large amounts of}} performance accelerating hardware. One alternative is a small, simple core that can be augmented with latency tolerant <b>helper</b> <b>engines.</b> As the demands placed on the processor core varies between applications, and even between phases of an application, the benefit seen from any set of <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> will vary tremendously. If {{there is a single}} core, these auxiliary structures can be turned on and off dynamically to tune the energy/performance of the machine {{to the needs of the}} running application. As more of the processor is broken down into <b>helper</b> <b>engines,</b> and as we add more and more cores onto a single chip which can potentially share helpers, the decisions that are made about these structures become increasingly important. In this paper we describe the need for methods that effectively manage these <b>helper</b> <b>engines.</b> Our counter-based approach can dynamically turn off 3 helpers on average, while staying within 2 % of the performance when running with all helpers. In a multicore environment, our intelligent and flexible sharing of <b>helper</b> <b>engines,</b> provides an average 24 % speedup over static sharing in conjoined cores. Furthermore we show benefit from constructively sharing <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> among multiple cores running the same application. ...|$|R

50|$|The Utah and Pleasant Valley Railroad, a {{predecessor}} of the Denver and Rio Grande Western, {{was building}} through Spanish Fork Canyon in 1875 - 1879.

50|$|Another {{use for the}} area's {{abundant}} timber {{came with}} the creation of an extensive charcoal business in the canyon; many Mill Fork residents were employed in cutting the wood or working the kilns. The charcoal business closed down around 1890, followed by the store, and Mill Fork was in a serious decline. Most residents had left by 1900; a few homesteaders lasted until the 1930s. The 1940s saw the change to diesel locomotives. No longer needed as a water stop, and with its <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> obsolete, the Mill Fork railway station was closed down in 1947. The railroad removed its section house in the late 1950s, leaving little besides the cemetery.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1950s, {{the first}} three newly {{designed}} locomotives (Neubauloks) of DR Class 99.23-24 came to the Harz Railway. As a result, the remaining five Mallets were no longer needed on the Nordhausen-Wernigerode line and were transferred to the Selke Valley Railway which suffered from a shortage of motive power. Two were scrapped - 99 5905 in 1975 due to damaged cylinders and an expired boiler certificate and 99 5904 in 1990 reportedly due to a damaged axle - but the remaining three {{are still in the}} fleet. 99 5901 suffered an accident in 1977, but could be repaired. After all passenger trains on the Harz narrow gauge lines were fitted with compressed air brakes, the HSB mallets could not be used for passenger duties any more and were stabled. Therefore, while 99 5901 passed inspection in 1991, it could only be used as a <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> when the Brocken line was reopened. Only in 1992, suitable compressed air braking equipment was found for two engines. 99 5903 was converted first, followed by 99 5901 in 1993. These engines were repainted in their historic green livery with yellow ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|The second {{locomotive}} in the head-end set, SP 7551, {{since it}} was dead-in-tow, did not have operative dynamic brakes, just air brakes. The event recorder downloaded from unit SP 7549 (the third locomotive), showed that it was producing traction current in motoring but no current in dynamic braking. The dynamic brakes of the fourth locomotive, SP 9340, operated sporadically and were of limited use. Unit SP 8317 (of the two-unit <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> set coupled {{to the rear of}} the train) also did not have an operative dynamic brake. Thus, among the four locomotives in front and the set of helpers on the end, only SP 8278 at the front of the train and SP 7443 at the back of the train had fully functioning dynamic brakes. This information was not passed on to the train dispatcher. The train engineer knew only that the second unit of the head-end consist (SP 7551) had no brakes, but believed he had more than sufficient dynamic brakes to maintain the speed of 6,151 tons (as was still listed in the cargo manifest) because 6,151 tons would only require the dynamic braking effort of five engines. With a true weight of 8,900 tons, however, the train would have needed the functioning dynamic brakes of at least six or seven engines (with moderate dependence on the air brakes), or five engines (with a heavy input from the air brakes) in order to maintain control.|$|E
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 1968, Ross Rowland's High Iron Company planned to operate a series of {{mainline}} steam excursions between Jersey City, NJ and Ardsley, PA on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. Rowland had originally planned to lease two ex Canadian Pacific G5-class 4-6-2s, numbers 1236 and 1283, both owned by George Hart, however those two locomotives were on emergency lease {{to the city of}} Reading, PA to provide steam for the city after the boiler at the Reading Steam Heat and Power Co. became disabled. Since tickets for the excursion had already been sold, and Rowland was unwilling to pull the trip with a diesel, he leased Steamtown's ex Canadian Pacific 127 (formerly the 1278), a sister to the two locomotives he intended to use to pull the train. However, the 127 did not have enough power to pull the train over the grades on the CNJ near Jim Thorpe, PA on her own, and Rowland leased Strasburg Rail Road 90 to act as a <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> for the trips, doubleheading with the 127 between Bethlehem, PA and Jim Thorpe, PA. After the trips concluded, 90 was returned to the Strasburg. As it was on the Great Western, 90 is also the most powerful of the four steam locomotives in operation at the Strasburg Rail Road in Lancaster County PA, rated for 1,211 tons on the line. The Strasburg Rail Road purchased her in 1967, and it {{is now one of the}} two operating decapods in the United States. The other one being former Frisco #1630, who still operates today in the Illinois Railway Museum. Another light decapod, Woodward Iron #41 (formerly Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad #401), just arrived at the Age of Steam Roundhouse in December 2015 for restoration.|$|E

5000|$|Hermosa {{has a small}} maintenance-of-way {{yard and}} siding, {{as well as the}} first water tank to fill the engine's tender. Doubleheaded trains will often be put {{together}} here, with the helper running light to Hermosa ahead of the train, take on water, and then await the arrival of the train with the road engine spotting itself at the tank and taking on water. After a brake test, the train will then take on the 30 minute, 2.5% climb between Hermosa and Rockwood. As the train climbs away from the valley, passengers will notice the locomotives working hard to pull the train through the many curves that now define the railroad. An hour after leaving Durango the train passes under US Highway 550 and slows to 10 mph to traverse the [...] "mini-highline", a rock shelf where the track follows the edge of a small cliff, and then picks up speed again through the meadow at Shalona. This is the last grade crossing the railroad encounters until Silverton. Slowing again after the crossing, the train winds around another rock face above Shalona Lake, with Rockwood being just around the next curve.Rockwood has a short wye and siding, and is also the first flagstop on the line. Being an hour and ten minutes by rail from Durango, some passengers lodging nearby opt to board the train here instead of driving all the way to town. The grade tops off for a while and the <b>helper</b> <b>engine</b> on doubleheaded trains will be cut off here and run ahead light to Tank Creek. As the train enters the narrow rock cut, it becomes the only ground transportation into the Animas Canyon.Passengers immediately notice the slow pace of the train as it winds onto the [...] "highline", a famous section of the railroad where the train crawls along the face of high cliffs. The engine crew will usually blow down the engine on the bridge at MP 471.2 to clean sediment from the boiler and the fireman will look back on his side of the train for a highball from the rear brakeman, indicating the rear of the train has cleared the bridge and the engineer can pick up speed to 15 mph, the track speed {{the rest of the way}} to Silverton. The roadbed closely follows the Animas River from now on, and the grade fluctuates quite a bit between here and Cascade Canyon. Tacoma is the next flagstop and the railroad has another siding here. At MP 474.5 is the Tank Creek water tank, and engines will stop here for water. The fireman will top off the tender, taking about , while the engineer oils around the engine and inspects machinery and bearings. On doubleheaded trains, the helper locomotive will then rejoin the train and perform another brake test.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Technology scaling {{trends and}} the {{limitations}} of packaging and cooling have intensified the need for thermally efficient architectures and architecture-level temperature management techniques. To combat these trends, we evaluate the thermal efficiency of the microcore architecture, a deeply decoupled processor core with larger structures factored out as <b>helper</b> <b>engines.</b> We further investigate activity migration (core swapping) {{as a means of}} controlling the thermal profile of the chip in this study. Specifically, the microcore architecture presents an ideal platform for core swapping thanks to <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> that maintain the state of each process in a shared fabric surrounding the cores. This results in significantly reduced migration overhead, enabling seamless swapping of cores. Our results show that our thermal mechanisms outperform traditional Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques by reducing the performance hit caused by slowing/swapping of cores. Our experimental results show that the microcore architecture has 86 % fewer thermally critical cycles compared to a conventional monolithic core. ...|$|R
50|$|Union Pacific {{introduced}} the Challenger-type (4-6-6-4) locomotives in 1936 on its main line over the Wasatch Range between Green River, Wyoming and Ogden, Utah. For {{most of the}} route, the maximum grade is 0.82% in either direction, but the climb eastward from Ogden, Utah into the Wasatch Range reached 1.14%. Hauling a 3,600 ST freight train demanded double heading and helper operations, and adding and removing <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> slowed operations.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station was}} built when the Rondout and Oswego Railroad got to Arkville (then called Dean's Corners) in 1871, {{covering}} {{the site of}} the ancient Tuscarora Indian headquarters.

50|$|Crawford Hill is {{the name}} of a helper {{district}} with an average 1.1% eastbound grade between Crawford, Nebraska, at an elevation of 3678 ft, and Belmont, Nebraska at 4499 ft on the BNSF Railway Butte Subdivision. Crawford Hill is formed as it climbs the Pine Ridge escarpment, formations of buttes and grassy dense sand hills lined with ponderosa pines.

50|$|In 1919, a {{real estate}} {{promoter}} named H.C. Mears surveyed a townsite at Soldier Summit and began to sell building lots. The town was incorporated in 1921. There were stores, hotels, saloons, restaurants, two churches, and a school. Growth was driven by the D&RGW moving some of its machine shops, used for servicing <b>helper</b> <b>engines,</b> to Soldier Summit from Helper. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints organized a branch in the new town on June 21, 1921, with Parley Bills as branch president. The number of Mormons in the town was large enough in June 1927 to organize a ward with Walter S. Groesbeck as bishop. The population of Soldier Summit peaked at 2,500 in the 1920s, but began to decline as the railroad decided to move its operations back to Helper due to the severe winters and high {{cost of doing business}} at the summit. The introduction of diesel locomotives, and the realignment of the tracks through Tucker and Gilluly which reduced the grade from 4% to 2%, eliminated the need to place <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> at the site, and further hurt the town's fortunes. The railroad moved many employees' homes to Helper, leaving only the foundations. By January 1930, the ward was reduced to a branch.|$|R

40|$|The {{trend towards}} larger {{structures}} and aggressive clock frequencies {{has been a}} fundamental driving force for modern microprocessor design. While one approach is to deeply pipeline any high delay structure, dependencies and critical loops have made {{it increasingly difficult to}} speed execution through extensive pipelining. One alternative is to remove larger structures from the critical path. We explore the ramifications of stripping all but the most necessary functionality out of the processing core, leaving only a tiny  -core. Although past studies have shown the possibility to build decoupled structures for some individual helper structures, the impact of streamlining all of these structures at the same time has not been explored. Along with describing the challenges in decoupling the <b>helper</b> <b>engines,</b> we focus on the performance, power consumption and thermal behavior of the  -core architecture. We use a detailed performance, power and thermal modeling in our analysis. Our results indicate that the  -core provides a 20 % reduction in power over a conventional monolithic core, while providing comparable performance (1 % improvement on average). By dynamically configuring the <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> to different application phases, an additional 13 % power savings can be attained with only an average 3 % degradation in performance. Our experi-KURSUN, SHAYESTEH, SAIR, SHERWOOD & REINMAN mental analysis also show that the microcore architecture has favorable thermal behavior, with 86 % fewer thermally-critical cycles compared to a monolithic core. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} the second bridge on a Wisconsin Central Railway line that {{connected}} Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, with Minneapolis, Minnesota. The line was originally built in 1884. The crossing of the St. Croix River was difficult for the railway, since the original bridge across the river was very low and trains {{had to contend with}} a steep grade {{on either side of the}} river. This made it necessary to use <b>helper</b> <b>engines</b> and to make trains shorter. In 1909 the Wisconsin Central Railway built a higher bridge over the river. The bridge is 184 ft above the river and 2682 ft long, with five steel arches towering above the river.|$|R
