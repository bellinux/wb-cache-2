40|$|Abstract. The planar solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (p-SOFC) is a {{promising}} configuration of a high-T fuel cell. Barium alumosilicate glass ceramics are suggested {{to use as}} sealants by many authors since these materials seem {{to meet the requirements}} to establish a hermetic and electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>seal</b> between the steel components of the SOFC. However, in long-term application, the formation of BaCrO 4 may degrade the interfacial strength between glass-ceramics and metallic interconnect and disrupt the cell components. In this work, a series of barium-free glass-ceramics in the system of CaO-MgO-B 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 were prepared. The selected compositions were located within the constitutional range of åkermanite – forsterite –anorthite. The thermal properties including glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) of the produced glasses were measured. The effect of boron oxide additions was studied in order to optimize the softening and flow behavior. For the experiments, a hot – stage microscope was used. Some glass compositions were mixed with high – CTE akermanite powder in order to increase their CTE after sintering. The CTE of the investigated materials after sintering at 900 o C, 2 h, ranged from 10. 5 to 11. 8 1...|$|E

Although there is an existing niche market for the design and production of poundo yam processing plant, proper parboiling of yam still remains the limitation to an effective application of the processing plant in the food industry. This paper presents the development and performance evaluation of a quick and highly effective parboiling machine for an instant poundo yam processing plant and its suitability to the food industrial applications. A 2 Hp, 1410 rpm electric motor, through a gear reduction mechanism, drives an auger shaft enclosed in a thermally <b>insulated,</b> <b>sealed</b> 75 litres parboiling chamber inside which full hot water of exact chamber’s volume at a regulated temperature of 70 oC- 80 oC is continually passed. The auger shaft which was designed to carry a maximum load of 486. 3 N rotates at 6. 7 r. pm and conveys the sliced yam from the hopper, through the hot water, to the outer end of the chamber in an average time of 3 minutes. The machine was designed to process 0. 0028802 m 3 (1. 22 tubers) of yam in one minute but the results after five different tests revealed that an average of 0. 00210 m 3 (1. 07 tubers) of yam was effectively parboiled in a minute. It was also found that the machine operation is simple, easily maintained and can be automated. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

The model has been validated by means of experimental tests in which a certified chimney has been installed in three roofs and spaced from flammable materials as prescribed by the manufacturer. In order to reproduce the diverse conditions that may occur in real installations, the clearance between chimney and roof has been sealed in three ways (<b>sealed</b> with <b>insulating</b> panels, <b>sealed</b> with metal sheets, and filled with insulating materials).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development process}} of an electrically insulating and liquid-impermeable coating for piezoelectric actuators. Against the background of flow investigations of an adaptive airfoil in a water tunnel the adaptive lip including PZTceramics for the active lip deformation must be <b>insulated</b> and <b>sealed</b> up against the ingress of moisture. Due to high electric field strength of 2 kV/mm between electrodes of multilayer actuators any ingress of moisture {{would lead to a}} reduction of the dielectric strength and may cause a short circuit. In order to prevent failure of the adaptive lip the electrical connections of the actuators have to be insulated by a waterproof coating. A service life of at least 10 ^ 7 load cycles at a frequency of 100 Hz is required for the actuators. Therefore the coating should be as ductile as possible otherwise it could crack and water could diffuse into the actuators. That is why the yield strength of the coating has to be higher than of the actuators, which is 0. 3...|$|R

40|$|On March 28, 1994, the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) {{responded to}} a report of smoke and sparks issuing from a chimney at a three story {{apartment}} building in Manhattan. The officer in charge ordered three- person hose teams to make entry into the first- and second-floor apartments while the truck company ventilated the stairway from the roof.

50|$|Certain {{laminating}} techniques use {{two steps}} of applying the epoxy to form resin impregnated fiber glass sheets. In {{the first step}} there is a resin solvent mixture which is partially cured so it will not redissolve in a second coating of the same mixture. The same resin mixture is subsequently given to the covered fiberglass with moderately cured resin in the second step. This second glaze which covers the first fills in the empty spaces between the fibers. The second coating is also only partially cured. This partial curing of the second layer furthers the curing of the first epoxy layer. This process also produces a thin sticky layer. The first coating acts like a <b>sealed</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet, preventing glass fiber contact with conductive planes. The second coating fills the planes and can form adhesive bonds to cores and conductive layers.|$|R
30|$|While {{it seems}} {{reasonable}} to argue that improved building design is the key to reducing energy needs, it is difficult and costly to renovate older homes to modern or better standards. <b>Insulating</b> and air <b>sealing</b> a home are still best, but for most homes there will remain a need for significant heat energy input during the cold months of winter. Homeowners fullfilling this need with low-emitting electricity generated in Ontario will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Homes using heat pumps will be the most energy efficient. The most economical heat pump to install is the air source heat pump (ASHP), which extracts heat from the outdoor air and pumps it into the interior of the home. ASHPs can effectively achieve over 300 % efficiencies, because they use electricity to move heat, rather than burn a fuel to liberate the heat within its chemical structures and then struggle to transfer {{as much of it as}} possible to the interior of the dwelling. Even electric resistance heating can achieve only 100 % efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|With {{applications}} requiring {{measurement of}} pressures between [...] and [...] Torr, {{the problem of}} ambient and process gases can be significantly reduced by replacing the OIS configuration with a CIS sampling system.

The upper limit is set by reduction in mean free path for ion-neutral collisions which takes place at higher pressures, and results in the scattering of ions and reduced sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|Graphite {{processing}} into intercalation compounds {{followed by}} thermoshock heating {{is known in}} literature. The result is an ultra-light dispersed graphite (thermographenit) used in lots of industries. Graphite intercalation compounds are formed {{as a result of}} the introduction of atomic and molecular layers of different chemical particles between the layers of graphite plates. The object of this work is to obtain a new material by intercalation of graphite followed by thermoshock heating, which could be used for products protecting biological and technical facilities from electromagnetic and thermal radiation. In the present work the parameters of oxidation and of graphite thermoshock expansion in order to obtain graphite intercalation compounds and thermographenit were investigated. The experiments were performed under laboratory non-isothermal conditions. Graphite GAK- 2 obtained from metallurgical wastes was used. First the fraction of + 0, 16  mm with the ash content of 0, 3 % was extracted by scattering. The oxidation of graphite was carried out by potassium bichromate dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid. The original sample of graphite was mixed with finely grounded potassium bichromate. Then this mass was poured over with 98 % concentrated sulphuric acid when being actively stirred and kept. Then the capacitance for oxidation was filled with distilled water. Decantation was carried out until pH= 7 in the waste water was got. Separation of the oxidized graphite from the main mass of water was carried out by means of a suction filter until pH= 7 was got. Experiments were performed at different ratios of potassium bichromate, sulphuric acid and graphite. The optimum ratio of the components (sulphuric acid) : (dichromate of potash) : (graphite) = 2, 8 : 0, 15 : 1 was found. The oxidation time was 4 – 5 minutes. The oxidized graphite turned into thermographenit with bulk density of 2, 7 – 9, 5 kg/m 3. upon subsequent heating up to 1000 oC within the regime of gravity-falling layer. Taking into account the unique structure and low bulk density of thermographenit it can be used as radio shielding, heat <b>insulating,</b> special <b>sealing</b> materia...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goal of this thesis is to develop an approximate dynamic analysis of <b>sealed</b> <b>insulating</b> glass (IG) units subject to uniform blast loads, the formulation of which will be incorporated into a computer program that will be used as a tool to estimate their dynamic response. The formulation of this approximate dynamic analysis of IG units is achieved by modeling the unit with two equivalent single degree of freedom systems consisting of equivalent masses, equivalent structural stiffnesses, equivalent forces, and by incorporating air space compatibility relationships into this model. The equations of motion which define the behavior of this dynamic model are incorporated into a computer program that computes the dynamic response of an IG unit subjected to a prescribed blast loading. This response includes the displacements, velocities, and accelerations of the glass plates of the IG unit. The blast loading will be idealized in order to simplify the analysis. The program will approximate the positive pressure phase of a blast load with an equivalent triangular loading. IG units designed by existing methods will be analyzed using the program, and their performance evaluated. This analysis will not only provide valuable data on the behavior of the IG units to blast loadings, but will lend insight into the acceptability of the existing design approach. The results will also indicate the acceptability of the technique developed in this thesis as a tool in the design and analysis of IG units subject to blast loads...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe polar regions of Mars offer a rich environment to search for signs of life. The Atromos probe was designed with the intent of investigating this polar region for evidence of life and to take atmospheric data in the harsh environment. The overall project was done as an example model and proof of concept for a small and affordable planetary probe capable of collecting scientific data used in life detection. Several key instruments were included such as a mass spectrometer, methane detector, gas chromatograph, and atmospheric characterization equipment. Some important components of the design were the ultra sonic drill, mechanical airbag system and deployable mast. The ultra sonic drill consists of a piezoelectric vibrator attached to a coring bit and a free mass. This drill can operate without external force applied and can bring back ice cores on the polar surface. The mechanical airbag system is an alternative method for touchdown in the EDL sequence. It minimizes the complexity and increases reliability of the probe surviving impact by utilizing spokes to absorb the impact. The deployable mast is used to enhance the atmospheric data collection by extending a series of temperature, pressure and anemometers to various distances above the surface. Notable subsystem work includes the power system and thermal regulation for operation on the planet. The power system consists of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator as well as solar panels that surround the probe. Power is stored in ultra capacitors and the probe operates on duty cycles when enough power is stored. The thermal regulation system consists of a <b>sealed</b> <b>insulated</b> box concealed within the probe. Inside the box are several radioisotope heating units to provide the warmth necessary for polar survival. System design, integration, testing and mock construction were performed on the various subsystems to determine feasibility and effectiveness. poster will be presented at the IPPW 6.

40|$|A {{composting}} Heat Extraction Unit (HEU) {{was designed}} to utilise waste heat from decaying organic matter {{for a variety of}} heating application The aim was to construct an <b>insulated</b> small scale, <b>sealed,</b> organic matter filled container. In this vessel a process fluid within embedded pipes would absorb thermal energy from the hot compost and transport it to an external heat exchanger. Experiments were conducted on the constituent parts and the final design comprised of a 2046 litre container insulated with polyurethane foam and kingspan with two arrays of qualpex piping embedded in the compost to extract heat. The thermal energy was used in horticultural trials by heating polytunnels using a radiator system during a winter/spring period. The compost derived energy was compared with conventional and renewable energy {{in the form of an}} electric fan heater and solar panel. The compost derived energy was able to raise polytunnel temperatures to 2 - 3 °C above the control, with the solar panel contributing no thermal energy during the winter trial and the electric heater the most efficient maintaining temperature at its preset temperature of 10 °C. Plants that were cultivated as performance indicators showed no significant difference in growth rates between the heat sources. A follow on experiment conducted using special growing mats for distributing compost thermal energy directly under the plants (Radish, Cabbage, Spinach and Lettuce) displayed more successful growth patterns than those in the control. The compost HEU was also used for more traditional space heating and hot water heating applications. A test space was successfully heated over two trials with varying insulation levels. Maximum internal temperature increases of 7 °C and 13 °C were recorded for building U-values of 1. 6 and 0. 53 W/m 2 K respectively using the HEU. The HEU successfully heated a 60 litre hot water cylinder for 32 days with maximum water temperature increases of 36. 5 °C recorded. Total energy recovered from the 435 Kg of compost within the HEU during the polytunnel growth trial was 76 kWh which is 3 kWh/day for the 25 days when the HEU was activated. With a mean coefficient of performance level of 6. 8 calculated for the HEU the technology is energy efficient. Therefore the compost HEU developed here could be a useful renewable energy technology particularly for small scale rural dwellers and growers with access to significant quantities of organic matte...|$|R
