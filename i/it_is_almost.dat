5|$|Like other snakes, it {{may fall}} prey to raptors, {{especially}} different species of snake eagles that migrate to Africa when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) may be a particular threat, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> strictly an ophiophagus raptor. Other snakes also prey on this species.|$|E

5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond is organic chemistry's strongest, {{and gives}} {{stability}} to organofluorines. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> non-existent in nature, but {{is used in}} artificial compounds.

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E

5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian {{processes in the}} late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|High on {{the eastern}} flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, , an eroded remnant of the earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier. It has a {{prominence}} of , and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> never climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate peak. If considered separately from Mt. Rainier, Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington.|$|E

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2613 is {{a spiral}} galaxy of {{magnitude}} 10.5 which appears spindle-shaped as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> edge-on to observers on Earth. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light-years away. It is notable {{for having a}} black hole around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a starburst galaxy due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the huge numbers of young stars within it.|$|E
5|$|P. d. bactrianus Zarudny and Kudashev, 1916, {{described}} from Tashkent, {{is found}} in southern Kazakhstan to the Tian Shan and northern Iran and Afghanistan. It intergrades with persicus in Baluchistan and with indicus across central Afghanistan. Unlike most other house sparrow subspecies, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> entirely migratory, wintering in the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. It {{is found in}} open country rather than in settlements, which are occupied by the Eurasian tree sparrow in its range. There is an exceptional record from Sudan.|$|E

5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to scoop various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary had the tiara {{altered to}} {{accommodate}} 15 of the Cambridge cabochon emeralds. The original drop pearls {{can easily be}} replaced {{as an alternative to}} the emeralds. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara directly from her grandmother in 1953. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively worn together with the Cambridge and Delhi Durbar parures, also containing large emeralds. Elizabeth wore the tiara in her official portrait as Queen of Canada as none of the Commonwealth realms besides the United Kingdom have their own crown jewels.|$|E

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} {{is not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} H.olivaceoalbus {{stretches}} across {{the northern and}} western North America as well as across Europe (except the Mediterranean region) and Russia. The fungus typically fruits between late summer and early winter, and occasionally (depending on the geographical location and climate) as early as June or right through December. The population is currently not endangered, except in France, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> extinct.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E
