These validated data were separated according to the periods of susceptibility maps. On annual and dry periods maps there was a larger percentage of MODIS data in the high susceptibility class. In the rainy period map, the percentage of MODIS data was more representative in medium susceptibility class. The results showed that there is a good efficiency of the methodology applied.

40|$|Aim Anthropogenic {{fires are}} a major {{component}} of the ecology of rangelands throughout the world. To assess the effects of these fires on the diversity patterns of herbivores, we related gradients in <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence,</b> climate and soil fertility to patterns in alpha and beta diversity of African ungulates. Location West Africa. Methods We used a survey-based approach for ungulates in 37 protected areas in desert, savanna and rain forest habitats throughout West Africa, combined with satellite images of <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> and digital <b>maps</b> of actual evapotranspiration and soil fertility. Alpha diversity was related to the environmental variables using conventional and spatial regression models. We investigated beta diversity using partial Mantel tests and ordination techniques, and by partitioning the variance in assemblage composition into environmental and spatial components. Results The species richness of grazers showed a quadratic relationship with actual evapotranspiration, whereas that of browsers and frugivores showed a linear relationship. However, in the multiple regression models <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> was the only variable that significantly correlated with the species richness of grazers. Soil fertility was weakly related to overall beta diversity and the species richness of browsers, but was non-significant in the multiple regression models. <b>Fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> was the most important variable explaining species composition of the overall species set and of grazers, whereas the assemblage composition of browsers and frugivores was explained mostly by actual evapotranspiration. Main conclusions In contrast to previous studies, our analyses show that moisture and nutrients alone fail to adequately predict the diversity patterns of grazing ungulates. Rather, the species richness and assemblage composition of grazers are largely governed by anthropogenic fires that modify the quality and structure of the grass sward. Diversity patterns of browsers and frugivores are markedly different from grazers and depend mainly on the availability of moisture, which is positively correlated with the availability of foliage and fruits. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating major human-induced disturbances or habitat alterations into analyses of diversity patterns...|$|R

Mise en relation des types d'habitat avec le risque d'incendie. / In {{a context}} of forest fire risk, the development of actions concerning wildfire prevention and land management is necessary and essential particularly in wildland urban interfaces (WUI). The term WUI' always includes components such as human presence and wildland vegetation. Both the hazard (probability of fire outbreak, distribution) and the vulnerability of urban areas can be characterized through the spatial organization of houses and vegetation. The first required step is to characterize and map WUI in large areas and at a large scale, which in turn requires qualifying different types of dwellings and mapping them. With this goal in view, the paper presents a brief synthesis of results coming from an exploratory process for the characterization of dwelling types (Lampin et al., 2007), and develops a method based on GIS-geo treatments to characterize different types of dwelling with regard to fire risk. Three types of dwellings were classified: isolated dwellings, scattered dwellings and clustered dwellings, using criteria based on the distance between houses, the size of clusters of houses and housing density, which can be mapped automatically. Within dwelling types, the density value of forest fire ignition changed and was twice as high for isolated dwellings as for clustered dwellings. The spatial organization of dwellings {{seems to have a}} real impact on <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Thus <b>maps</b> of different dwelling types can be interpreted for use in developing fire fighting strategies or prevention actions concerning end-users such as forest and land planning managers or fire-fighters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Information on the {{temporal}} and spatial patterns of forest fires can contribute to efficient forest fire management. To evaluate the readjustment of forest fire precautionary periods and to provide information for forest fire prevention and suppression strategies, {{the temporal}} and spatial characteristics of forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and spread in Korea were analysed using statistics from 1970 to 2003. Monthly forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and burned area were examined using time-series analysis, and F-tests were conducted among forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences,</b> burned area, and fire area growth rate to understand monthly forest fire characteristics. To understand the spatial characteristics of forest fires, cities and counties with similar forest fire characteristics were grouped based on cluster analysis of forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and spread characteristics. A seasonal exponential smoothing model was selected for forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and burned area. The number of mean annual forest <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> was 429, and mean annual burned area was 2908 ha year− 1 in Korea.

40|$|South Africa’s growing {{elephant}} {{populations are}} concentrated in relatively small enclosed protected areas resulting in the over utilisation of the available food sources. Elephants and other herbivores {{as well as other}} natural disturbances such as fires and droughts {{play an important role in}} maintaining savannah environments. When these disturbances become too concentrated in a particular area the vegetation composition may be negatively affected. Excessive damage to the vegetation would result from exceeding the capacity of a protected area to provide food resources. The effect of the 120 elephants on the vegetation of Welgevonden Private Game Reserve, is not known. The rugged terrain of this reserve makes it a difficult, time consuming and labour intensive exercise to conduct ground studies. Satellite images can be used as a monitoring tool for vegetation change and improve the quantity and quality of environmental data to be collected significantly, allowing more informed management decision-making. This study evaluated the use of satellite imagery for monitoring elephant induced vegetation change on Welgevonden Private Game Reserve. The LANDSAT Thematic Mapper multispectral images, acquired at two yearly intervals from 1993 until 2007 were used. However, no suitable images were available for the years 1997, 2001 and 2003. A series of vegetation change maps was produced and the distribution of water sources and <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> <b>mapped.</b> The areas of change were then correlated with the spatial distribution of water points and fire occurances, with uncorrelated areas of change. This was analysed using large animal population trends, weather data and management practices. On the visual comparison of the vegetation maps, it was seen that over this time period there was some decrease and thinning of woodland, but the most notable change was the increase of open woodland and decrease in grasslands. Using only the digital change detection for the period 1993 to 2007, a general increase in vegetation cover is seen. But this generalisation is misleading, since comparing the digital change detection to the vegetation maps indicates that while vegetation cover may have increased, significant changes occurred in the vegetation types. Most of the areas of significant change that were identified showed a strong positive correlation with burnt areas. The distribution of the water sources could not be directly linked to the vegetation change although rainfall fluctuations seemed to have accelerated vegetation changes. Years with high game counts, such as 1999, also coincide with very low rainfall making it difficult to differentiate between the effects of heavy utilisation of vegetation and low rainfall. Furthermore, many of the initial vegetation changes could be the result of land use changes due to the introduction of browsers, selective grazers and elephants that allow for more natural utilisation of the vegetation. Remote sensing makes it possible to successfully track changes in vegetation and identify areas of potential elephant induced vegetation change. Vegetation changes caused by disturbances, such as fire and anthropogenic activities, can be accounted for but it is not possible to conclude with a high level of certainty that the further changes seen are solely a result of elephant damage. Further work is required to reliably isolate elephant induced vegetation changes, as well as to establish the effects these changes have on the ecosystem as a whole. Environmental Sciences(M. Sc.

In the Russian Far East, since forest fires occur every year, {{they have had a}} great influence on the earth environment. Especially, the fire smoke influences the region where a forest fire doesn’t occur because it extends more widely than a fire does. In this paper, we examined the extension of the distribution of the forest fire smoke in the Russian Far East for ten years from 1994 to 2003. We used 380 scenes of NOAA AVHRR. The smoke distribution and precipitation were compared about data as which the number of cases and the season of the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> were almost the same.

Fire scar locations indicated that fires occurred primarily {{in the late summer}} and fall, which was consistent with <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> data records. <b>Fire</b> scars were absent from all trees after 1890, likely corresponding to rapid settlement of the area around Idaho City beginning in 1862, and active fire suppression some time in the early 1900 ’s. <b>Fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> was strongly correlated with Palmer Drought Severity Index, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation...|$|R
30|$|This study {{covers the}} whole Iberian Peninsula {{territory}} (492 175 km 2), {{which is one}} of the most fire-affected areas in Europe (Martínez et al. 2009). The time series under analysis spans from 2001 to 2007. To obtain statistical models between <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> and LFMC, two sets of data were derived: the LFMC was based on empirical models applied to satellite images, while the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> was estimated from the MODIS Thermal Anomalies product (MOD 14).|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of wildfires in the Mediterranean context through the characterization of fire regime and {{the assessment of the}} main driving forces on <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence.</b> A preliminary hierarchical cluster analysis, based on the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> and weather data in the period 1985 - 2008 has allowed to identify 6 areas homogeneous for fire events/regime and climate. Subsequently, three specific chapters have been developed. In the first chapter, the fire seasonality has been assessed for each area; the analysis also demonstrated that some changes occurring during the examined period. Then, the fire-weather relationships have been characterized. In the last chapter, two common fire danger indexes (the Canadian Fire Weather Index FWI, and the Keetch-Byram Drought Index KBDI) have been used to study the fire danger across Italy and its potential to reproduce the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The results improve our knowledge of wildfire occurrence in Italy. The fire regime under current climate conditions has been characterized with a statistical and descriptive analysis. In addition, the analysis of the relationships between <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence,</b> weather, and <b>fire</b> danger can be usefully applied to assess the impacts of climate changes on fire regimes in Italy...|$|R
30|$|Wildfire {{susceptibility}} {{analyses are}} useful for <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> prediction, zonation, and follow-up management. Statistical models, such as regression models, which have been developed from historical data to estimate the probabilities of <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> under various local environmental conditions, are valuable for understanding general historical trends. These models {{can be used to}} predict outcomes, such as the expected number of fires in an area, from explanatory variables such as vegetation patterns, landforms, meteorological factors, and past fire history (Weinstein and Woodbury 2010).|$|R
40|$|Spatio-temporal {{clusters}} in 1997 ? 2003 fire {{sequences of}} Tuscany region (central Italy) {{have been identified}} and analysed by using the scan statistic, a method which was devised to evidence clusters in epidemiology. Results showed that the method is reliable to find clusters of events and to evaluate their significance via Monte Carlo replication. The evaluation {{of the presence of}} spatial and temporal patterns in <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> and their significance could have a great impact in forthcoming studies on <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> prediction...|$|R
40|$|MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) hotspot and {{precipitation}} {{data for the}} most recent 11 -year period (2002 to 2012) were analyzed to elucidate recent trends in the seasonal and spatial <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> in Sumatra and the relationship with precipitation. Using a latitude line of S 0. 5 °, Sumatra was divided into two regions, N. (north) and S. (south) Sumatra. Different trends in seasonal fire occur-rence were discussed and further defined by considering two different precipitation patterns. Analysis of hotspot (fire) data was carried out using 0. 5 ° × 0. 5 ° grid cells to evaluate recent trends of spatial fire oc-currence. Analysis results of hotspot and {{precipitation data}} were also tallied every 10 -day to find the rela-tionship between seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> and the dry season. Standard deviation (SD) and variance (V) were then used to evaluate <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> in Sumatra and Kalimantan objectively. The relatively mild <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> tendency in Sumatra compared to Kalimantan could {{be the result of}} different stages of forest development or the high deforestation rate in Sumatra compared with Kalimantan. This paper also shows that the two different seasonal fire activities in N. and S. Sumatra were closely related to the two different dry season types: a winter and summer dry season type (WD & SD) in N. Sumatra, and a summer dry season type (SD) in S. Sumatra. Extreme <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> in the Dumai region in 2005 and Palembang region in 2006 could be partially explained by a severe drought occurrence enhanced by two different kinds of El Niño events...|$|R

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that climatic factors are one of {{significant}} parameters in <b>occurrence</b> of natural <b>fires</b> in forest and range ecosystems. The goal of this study was a monthly-based prediction of the occurrence of the natural fires using artificial neural networks in Izeh, north-west of Khuzestan province. The natural <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> data including date of the occurrence, the burned area and number of the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> was obtained from Izeh Natural Resources Office. The findings indicated that the algorithm of multiple layer perceptron and hyperbolic function were efficient in exploring the relationship between climatic factors and the natural <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The networks with two hidden layers and 15 neurons have revealed high accuracy in prediction of the natural <b>fires</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Moreover, for prediction step FMSE(Final Mean Square) was recorded 0. 0038. While for testing step, coefficient of variation, MSE(Mean Square), and NMSE(Normal Mean Square) were equal to 0. 99, 0. 073, and 0. 018, respectively. For validation step, the trained network has indicated a high determination coefficient (r 2 = 0. 98) between the observed and predicted values. It should be mentioned that the present approach in this study could achieve an artificial neural network with medium performance (r 2 = 0. 58) between climate data and the burned area of the natural fire...|$|R
