5|$|Many {{accidents}} when driving personal {{vehicles are}} caused by <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes. Specifically, passenger and cell phone interaction accounted for 27% of crashes, the leading cause. Drivers looking away from the target (roadway) also accounted for 19%.|$|E
25|$|National Safety Council (NSC): This not-for-profit {{organization}} {{has developed a}} number of products to support occupational road safety. One example is the “Cell Phone Policy Kit”, {{which is designed to}} assist organizations in implementing policies and communicating them to employees. NSC provides other online road safety resources of value to employers; its road safety page links to resources on <b>distracted</b> <b>driving,</b> teen driving, and its employer road safety initiative “Our Driving Concern.” NSC also offers a comprehensive safety manual for use by organizational fleet managers, which contains numerous checklists and sample policies as well as articles on topics such as <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of <b>distracted</b> <b>driving</b> has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on <b>distracted</b> <b>driving</b> free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E
25|$|Employers are in {{a unique}} {{position}} because they can use the employer-employee relationship as leverage to complement and enforce government policies that require safety belt use, prohibit impaired driving, and prohibit mobile-phone use and other forms of <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> Safe-driving policies implemented in the workplace can promote safer driving away from work. In addition, employers, as purchasers of large fleets of vehicles, can spur improvements in vehicle safety, and encourage development of road safety capacity and legislation in the local areas and countries in which they operate, thereby improving road safety for all.|$|E

500|$|Vehicle-related SCI is {{prevented}} with measures including societal {{and individual}} {{efforts to reduce}} {{driving under the influence}} of drugs or alcohol, <b>distracted</b> <b>driving,</b> and drowsy driving. [...] Other efforts include increasing road safety (such as marking hazards and adding lighting) and vehicle safety, both to prevent accidents (such as routine maintenance and antilock brakes) and to mitigate the damage of crashes (such as [...] head restraints, air bags, seat belts, and child safety seats). [...] Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment, such as nonslip materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers, railings for stairs, child and safety gates for windows. Gun-related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training, gun safety education campaigns, and changes to the technology of guns (such as trigger locks) to improve their safety. [...] Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety, and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head-first tackling in association football.|$|E
500|$|Enforcement and {{compliance}} with seat belt laws varies by state. (Massachusetts, {{which had the}} lowest death rate per 100 million miles traveled in 2015, was among the states with the lowest use of seat belts.) Some states require motorcycle helmets while others do not. Speed limits, traffic density, topography, climate and many other factors affect the divergent accident rates by state. Speed limits in Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie rather than absolute. This allows motorists in those states to defend against a speeding charge {{if it can be}} proven that the speed was reasonable and prudent. In good driving conditions, many drivers in prima facie states presume (usually correctly) that police will allow some tolerance in enforcement. Even in states with absolute speed limits, enforcement and penalties vary from one state to another. For these and other reasons, state-to-state comparisons are difficult. There are many studies examining increases in Interstate speed limits from 55mph to 65, 70 and 75mph. Some found that fatality rates increased significantly on Interstate highways where speed limits were raised. One study that examined the change from 55 to 65mph found higher Interstate speed limits improved overall highway safety by drawing traffic from less safe secondary highways to safer Interstate highways. Since the changes to 80mph speed limits in some states (and 85mph on one section of a toll highway in Texas) are relatively recent, robust analysis is not yet available. Anecdotal evidence suggests actual vehicle speeds did not increase as much as speed limits did. Also, police may be enforcing the new higher limits more strictly than they enforced the prior limits. In some states, police have reallocated resources to focus more on impaired and <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> The higher speed limits are predominantly in rural states, which tend to be Republican states. To many Republican voters, speed limits (and seat belt laws) are seen as intrusions on personal liberty. According to transportation historian Owen Gutfreund, state governments may raise speed limits because raising the speed limit “sounds like such an easy regulatory win.” It’s a simple way to “get government out of your face.” ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{complaints}} that mobile spotters are a danger to others on the road. One potential danger posed by mobile spotters is <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> Spotters can be distracted while monitoring radar while driving. Another cause for concern is that mobile spotters commonly park their vehicles on the shoulder {{for a short time}} while they observe, causing congestion along the roadway. In some areas, parking on the shoulder is only allowed in emergency situations, and it is also believed that spotters pose a distraction to others driving. Most spotter groups do support parking on the shoulder as long as it can be safely done and there is no other alternative. Many spotters have found ways to stay off the roadway altogether by parking in parking lots, driveways (when allowed), or field roads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Improving driving {{safety is}} one major {{objective}} of forming vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Existing VANETs usually assume drivers detect and report safetyrelated road conditions. However, drivers {{may not be}} willing to perform these duties; even they are, these duties may <b>distract</b> them from <b>driving</b> and thus make driving unsafe. To address the problem, this paper proposes an automatic detection system. By taking advantage of the communication capability of roadside sensors, the proposed system can automatically detect and locate problematic road conditions without any human intervention under varying traffic densities. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed system. Keywords-VANETs; sensor; detection; road condition; I...|$|R
30|$|If {{threatening}} or high-risk {{objects in}} plain sight draw attention, officers should be likely {{to see it and}} call attention to it. That is, the potential threat should override inattentional blindness. Alternatively, if unexpected objects are only processed after they reach conscious awareness, then the implied threat might have little effect on conscious noticing, and officers will have inattentional blindness for the gun. We address whether inattentional blindness occurs during this naturalistic, commonly performed task with an unexpected object of direct relevance to the participant. Although anecdotal evidence from real-world analogues suggests that inattentional blindness is common (e.g., in <b>distracted</b> walking or <b>driving),</b> no studies have demonstrated such inattentional blindness under controlled conditions.|$|R

In 2008, there were 23,059 accidents involving 16- to 19-year-olds, which led to 194 deaths. Of these deaths, 10% were reported {{to be caused by}} <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> Throughout the United States, over 3,000 deaths and 416,000 injuries annually can be attributed to <b>distracted</b> <b>driving.</b> To further illustrate the seriousness of this [...] "epidemic," [...] driving while texting is about 4 times more likely to result in an accident than drinking while driving. Not only is <b>distracted</b> <b>driving</b> more likely to result in an accident, but the risk of injury requiring hospital visitation is 3-5 times greater than the rate for other accidents.|$|E
