500|$|Robert Gottschalk founded Panavision in late 1953, in {{partnership}} with Richard Moore, Meredith Nicholson, Harry Eller, Walter Wallin, and William Mann; the company was formally incorporated in 1954. Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing CinemaScope films. At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where many of his customers were cinematographers. [...] A few years earlier, he and Moore—who worked {{with him in the}} camera shop—were experimenting with underwater photography; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses, which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing. The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank periscopes; the periscope image was horizontally [...] "squeezed" [...] by the anamorphic lens. After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic optical element, the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C. P. Goerz, a New York optics company, for use in their underwater photography. As widescreen filmmaking became popular, Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry—first <b>for</b> <b>projectors,</b> and then for cameras. Nicholson, a friend of Moore, started working as a cameraman on early tests of anamorphic photography.|$|E

5000|$|Using this technique, Blodgett {{developed}} practical {{uses for}} Langmuir’s gossamer films. Blodgett used a barium stearate film to cover glass with 44 monomolecular layers, making the glass more than 99% transmissive and creating [...] "invisible" [...] glass. The visible light {{reflected by the}} layers of film canceled the reflections created by the glass. This type of nonreflective coating is now called Langmuir-Blodgett film and is widely used. The first major cinematic production to use Blodgett's invisible glass was the popular film Gone with the Wind (1939), noted for its crystal-clear cinematography. Once introduced, nonreflective lenses were used <b>for</b> <b>projectors</b> and cameras by the post-war movie industry. Blodgett's glass was also used for submarine periscopes and airplane spy cameras during World War II.|$|E
50|$|A halogen lamp, {{also known}} as a {{tungsten}} halogen, quartz-halogen or quartz iodine lamp, is an incandescent lamp consisting of a tungsten filament sealed into a compact transparent envelope that is filled with a mixture of an inert gas and a small amount of a halogen such as iodine or bromine. The combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten to the filament, increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope. Because of this, a halogen lamp can be operated at a higher temperature than a standard gas-filled lamp of similar power and operating life, producing light of a higher luminous efficacy and color temperature. The small size of halogen lamps permits their use in compact optical systems <b>for</b> <b>projectors</b> and illumination.|$|E

50|$|Although few {{cameras were}} made that could record the sound {{directly}} onto the film (Fairchild Cinephonic Eight cameras, Fairchild Professional 900 cameras, and Pictorial cameras), there were many projectors that could record and replay sound on a magnetic stripe. For cameras, this stripe had {{to be added to}} the film before it had been exposed. <b>For</b> <b>projectors,</b> the stripe had {{to be added to the}} film after it had been processed. The stripe was added between the perforations and the edge of the film (see illustration at head of article). Sometimes a balance stripe was added on the opposite edge. This had no purpose other than to allow the film to be completely flat in front the projection window. For synchronised sound, the sound was specified as 56 frames in advance of the picture On the Cinephonic Eight cameras, the picture/sound separation was 52 frames. Fifty six frames was the same physical distance as magnetic sound was specified for the 16mm film format (or 28 frames in that format). Optical sound was never specified as the format had insufficient space for an optical track.|$|E
