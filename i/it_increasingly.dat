5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> stressful, {{especially}} since he did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started thinking about a change of career.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{appeared}} {{on television and}} in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult for her to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th-century, the act {{of suicide}} had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by {{insanity}} in Europe. Although suicide remained illegal during this period, <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>it’s</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{recognised}} that {{meat and}} dairy {{are the largest}} sources of food-related emissions. The UK’s consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption.|$|R

5|$|During this time, the Flames found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult}} {{to retain their}} best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary {{has always been one}} of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult to}} compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} was battle-tested in 1915 when Germany {{attacked the}} Russian Empire, and withstood eleven days of assault before capture. After World War I, the fortress' military importance declined as advances in weaponry rendered <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> obsolete. It {{was used by}} various civil institutions and as a garrison.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E
50|$|Mobile {{account opening}} is so new, it’s {{hard to find}} {{statistics}} on it. Almost all the banks that allow it are larger than $50 billion in assets. But <b>it’s</b> <b>increasingly</b> talked about as an avenue to generate new customers and accounts {{in an age when}} consumers increasingly rely on their smartphones for everything.|$|R

5|$|Goeslaw {{is married}} to guitarist Anto Hoed. Together they have two children, Anakku Lelaki Hoed and Lelaki Bernama Hoed (literally My Son Hoed and Boy Named Hoed). In her spare time she enjoys shopping, playing with her children, and {{browsing}} the internet; she has stated that she finds <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to enjoy shopping due to being constantly recognised. She has stated that she prefers being backstage over giving concerts, as {{she does not have}} to wear make-up or rehearse.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E
5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E

5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the Japanese were finding <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult}} to resupply their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, {{refusing to let}} Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the Japanese were forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult}} or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

50|$|On June 30, 2011, the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway {{opened and}} runs roughly {{parallel}} to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The opening of the high-speed railway relieved the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from overcrowding, and <b>it's</b> <b>increasingly</b> shifted to freight traffic. As of early 2015, 3 regular trains per day go full way from Beijing to Shanghai on the old line, although hundreds of trains still use selected sections of it.|$|R

5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult}} to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean {{to avoid the}} humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1140s the active {{phase of the}} civil war was over, barring the {{occasional}} outbreak of fighting. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> appeared as though the English Church was considering promoting a peace treaty. On Louis VII's return from the Second Crusade in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the potential threat to his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown. In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son Eustace as the rightful heir to the duchy and launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province. Henry's father advised him {{to come to terms with}} Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by Bernard of Clairvaux. Under the settlement Henry did homage to Louis for Normandy, accepting Louis as his feudal lord, and gave him the disputed lands of the Norman Vexin; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.|$|E
5|$|Caesar held {{both the}} {{dictatorship}} and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, {{gave him the}} power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised {{the membership of the}} Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2015-16 season, Tozer {{was offered}} a new {{contract}} by the club. On 10 June 2016, local newspaper based in Yeovil Town reported that Tozer had agree to sign a new contract with the club.

50|$|The United Church of Canada has {{within its}} members those whose values may be {{somewhat}} more conservative than those in higher levels of Church governance. It also has members whose values are somewhat more liberal {{than those in the}} wider levels of Church governance. The Church has taken a rather difficult middle road. <b>Its</b> <b>increasingly</b> inclusive stance has lost it many conservative congregations and members and has gained some of more liberal attitude.|$|R
5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift {{of power in the}} capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{transformed}} Libya {{into a new}} socialist state {{called a}} Jamahiriya ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both {{the military and the}} Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing left <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> isolated on the international stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi rejected Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and Pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009–10. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily {{on the side of the}} anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.|$|E
50|$|Increases in Internet connectivity, {{bandwidth}} availability, and {{the proliferation}} of webcams have also had implications for virtual sex enthusiasts. <b>It's</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for these activities to include the exchange of pictures or motion video. There are companies which allow paying customers to actually watch people have live sex or masturbate {{and at the same time}} allow themselves to be watched as well. Recently devices have been introduced and marketed to allow remote controlled stimulation.|$|R
