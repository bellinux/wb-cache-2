60|$|She still <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} Sydney--still spoke to Sydney.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated. She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{turned away}} from him, but her manner denoted impatience.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not notice}} that her voice was strange, nor that she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted.|$|E
60|$|My aunt <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on me {{over and}} round the coffee-machine as I did so. She was greatly interested, and asked several elucidatory questions.|$|R
60|$|The unbreathed sigh {{seemed to}} be added to the weight of oppression on Mary's patient breast; but she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> steady, <b>her</b> brow unruffled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do stop, Nursey, or I shall {{go crazy}} because I don't know the secret!" [...] cried Effie, more than once; and she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on the clock, for at {{seven in the}} evening the {{surprise}} was to come off.|$|R
60|$|She again muttered {{something}} {{which was all}} but inaudible, but <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed upon her work.|$|E
60|$|She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, {{but he saw}} {{the faint}} spot of color burning in her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|A tremor {{of anxiety}} {{passed over the}} young man's face, on which she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{steadily}} fixed.|$|E
60|$|Lilias, for {{a moment}} or two, <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on <b>her</b> mistress, who looked so unusually pale, that she seemed about to faint; but the Lady {{instantly}} recovered herself, and declining the assistance which her attendant offered her, walked to her own apartment.|$|R
6000|$|Merry hated {{clearing}} up, but dutifully {{did every}} distasteful task, and <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on careless Roxy till all was in order; then she gladly went to perch on her father's knee, seeing {{in all the}} faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the [...] "little one." ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> upon Henchard also. One day he {{answered}} her inquiry for his health {{by saying that}} he could not endure Abel Whittle's pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard. [...] "He is such a fool," [...] said Henchard, [...] "that he can never get out of his mind the time when I was master there." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her in some surprise. She drew a little breath and <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{steadily}} averted.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her thoughtfully. She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, but {{she seemed to be}} {{shivering}} a little.|$|E
60|$|Hetty <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} Dinah's face--at first {{like an animal}} that gazes, and gazes, and keeps aloof.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think you're very simple." [...] And Madame Merle <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on <b>her</b> cup. [...] "I've come to {{that with}} time. I judged you, as I say, of old; but it's only since your {{marriage}} that I've understood you. I've seen better what you have been to your wife than I ever saw what you were for me. Please be very careful of that precious object." ...|$|R
60|$|He then {{expressed}} his regrets to Fan for having come without first writing {{to ask her}} permission, and after shaking hands with her and bowing to Constance, turned away. As he moved across the floor Fan <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on Mary's face, and seemed at last about to make an appeal to her, when Constance, standing by her side, and also observing Mary, touched her hand to restrain her.|$|R
60|$|Katie, {{who wanted}} to begin the play at the beginning, <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> anxiously on Charley, who was still {{standing}} with Lactimel Neverbend on his arm. 'Oh, now,' said she to herself, 'if he should forget me and begin dancing with Miss Neverbend!' But then she remembered how he had jumped into the water, and determined that, even with such provocation as that, she must not be angry with him.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} face towards him, but <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, {{looking out of}} the window. She was flushed.|$|E
60|$|They {{stared at}} one another {{for a moment and}} then she looked away. She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted when she spoke.|$|E
60|$|Florence, {{without knowing}} why, felt almost afraid {{to hear her}} proceed, but <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> riveted on the {{beautiful}} face so fixed upon her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Helen. [...] "Can't you {{remember}} {{as a child}} chopping up hay--" [...] she spoke {{much more quickly than}} usual, and <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed upon Mrs. Thornbury, [...] "and pretending it was tea, and getting scolded by the nurses--why I can't imagine, except that nurses are such brutes, won't allow pepper instead of salt though there's no earthly harm in it. Weren't your nurses just the same?" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Ewes, never faltering, <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> keen <b>eye</b> fixed hard on {{her with}} a searching glance, as she ran over the keys in ever fresh combinations.|$|R
60|$|Surprises, in Josie's line of {{work were}} not uncommon, and this {{was no time to}} {{consider}} whys and wherefores. The one thing she was sure of was that the bomb was in the black satchel and the black satchel in Kauffman's hand. No matter where the other conspirators might be or how they were implicated in tonight's plot, as long as she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on the bomb, {{she would be able to}} control the situation.|$|R
6000|$|Cynthia <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on Jeff, {{who dropped}} his to his mother's face. [...] "Cynthy did it; but I guess I gave her good enough reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|Francie had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the ground; {{the others}} were all now rather unnaturally smiling. [...] "Won't they forgive me ever?" [...] she asked, looking up.|$|E
6000|$|She had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on {{him while}} he spoke, and this was what, visibly, {{determined}} a repetition for her. [...] "Are you trying to frighten me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{good for}} two private boxes, and at leest twenty tickets, I should say," [...] cried the daughter, a prudent lass, who always <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> fine <b>eyes</b> {{on the main}} chance.|$|R
60|$|She saw him no more till evening; then {{he looked}} excited, played stormily, and would sing in {{defiance}} of danger. The trouble in Amy's face seemed reflected in Helen's, though not a word had passed between them. She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on Casimer, with an intentness that worried Amy, and {{even when he was}} at the instrument Helen stood near him, as if fascinated, watching the slender hands chase one another up and down the keys with untiring strength and skill.|$|R
60|$|But that {{princess of}} the Incas, with {{an aspect of}} imperturbable gravity, <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>eyes</b> on the ground, though the brown of her little cheeks seemed to deepen a trifle in colour.|$|R
60|$|She never {{opened her}} mouth. I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on me in}} a cool, {{regardless}} manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will not!" [...] said Gwendolen, {{taking up}} her gauntlets {{and putting them}} on, while she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on him with {{gathering}} fun in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I was saying: It was a cinch to {{see that}} Sandy's girl thought you was ace high, alrightee. She <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> glommed onto you all the time." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be a perfect crowd of richly-dressed nobles, ladies, children; and though the Lady Joanna held her head up in full state, and <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on <b>her</b> sister to make her do the same, their bewilderment was great; and when they had been {{conducted}} to a splendid chamber, within that allotted to the Drummond ladies, tapestry-hung, and with silver toilette apparatus, to prepare for supper, Jean dropped upon a high-backed chair, and insisted that Dame Lilias should explain to her exactly who each one was.|$|R
60|$|Cassy <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> {{glittering}} <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} Legree, as she spoke, {{and he stared}} at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath.|$|R
60|$|Along that {{strip of}} shadow she ran, crouching; now {{stumbling}} over a boulder, now crushing {{her bare feet}} between the sharp pebbles, as, heedless where she stepped, she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on <b>her</b> mother. As if fascinated, she could see nothing else in heaven or earth but that dark figure, hurrying along with a dogged determination, and then stopping a moment to look round, as if in fear of a pursuer. And then Grace {{lay down on the}} cold stones, and pressed herself into the very earth; and the moment her mother turned to go forward, sprang up and followed.|$|R
