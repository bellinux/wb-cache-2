40|$|Many {{companies}} {{build up}} manufacturing networks {{to cope with}} globalized competition. Among others, this requires a decision on a technical basis, which product should be manufactured at which location. In this paper a <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> system is introduced to measure a location’s competence on a technical basis. This system consists of three <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> indicators: cycle time ratio, adjusted cycle time ratio, and stability of the cycle time. The most important <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> in this <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> system is the stability of cycle time. It indicates how experienced and stable the serial production can be managed. This indicator {{is defined as the}} ratio of the mean absolute deviation of the cycle time and the achieved cycle time. Based on this, a company can take a more objective technical decision regarding relocation processes.

500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{discussed}} in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out {{the position of}} the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average annual bonus of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> fixed for each ministry {{at the start of a}} new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that [...] "olitical service is much more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policymaking. ... Pegging ministerial salaries to civil service salaries is not an adequate mechanism to account for the burdens and responsibilities that come with the job." ...|$|E

This paper specifically explores whether tacit knowledge transfer should be made mandatory and a <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> in the annual performance reviews of academic staff. This study was conducted by collecting primary data through interviews of academics in four Australian universities. The findings reveal that academics are not in favour of making tacit knowledge mandatory and also indicated an aversion towards the inclusion of tacit knowledge transfer as a <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> especially because {{it can be difficult to}} measure. Based on the findings, it is recommended universities focus on buttressing encouragement and motivation, developing mentoring programs, providing recognition and collaboration opportunities to entice academics to share tacit knowledge without necessarily making it a <b>key</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator.</b> Adopting the recommendations should enable tacit knowledge to be shared freely in an unimpeded environment...|$|R
