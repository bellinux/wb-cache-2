40|$|Stocking at {{and after}} {{thinning}} forest plantations influences the site {{resources available to}} each tree, thereby affecting the size of logs {{and the value of}} the stand at harvest. Log prices generally indicate increasing value with increasing log size. A Eucalyptus pilularis Correlated Curve Trend (CCT) trial was used to examine distribution of tree size for stands established at 1495 trees ha− 1 and progressively thinned to <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> densities of 700, 450, 250, 125 and 87 stems ha− 1. Diameter at breast height over bark and total height measurements, collected periodically over 36 years, were used to define stem taper. Smalian’s sectional volume formula was used to calculate log volume at 1 -m intervals. Stems were then merchandised to current log size and pricing to determine optimum dollar values. Establishment and early maintenance costs were used to calculate net present value (NPV) at a discount rate of 6 % and internal rate of return (IRR). The relationship between value over time and <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> was irregular. The control (1495 stems ha− 1) had the highest volume ha− 1 at age 36 years. <b>Final</b> <b>stocking</b> densities of 125 stems ha− 1 and 700 stems ha− 1 achieved the highest (8. 13 %) and lowest (6. 19 %) IRR, respectively...|$|R

30|$|The 300 Index is {{a volume}} {{productivity}} index for P. radiata {{that provides a}} more accurate means to ascertain site productivity than Site Index. The 300 Index is calculated by adjusting field plot measurements for age, stand density and silvicultural history to give the mean annual increment (expressed as m 3  ha− 1  year− 1) at age 30 for a reference regime where all crop trees are pruned to 6  m in a timely fashion, thinned to the <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> density (300  stems ha− 1) {{at the completion of}} the final pruning. Research within New Zealand P. radiata plantations has shown that accurate and unbiased values for the 300 Index can be obtained using measurements taken from stands differing in age or stand density from those of the 300 Index standard regime (30  years and 300  stems ha− 1, Kimberley et al. 2005). The mean 300 Index for New Zealand is 27.4  m 3  ha− 1  year− 1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} daily feeding {{frequency}} (Exp I), water temperature (Exp II), and stocking density (Exp III) {{on the growth}} of river puffer, Takifugu obscurus, juvenile fish of 10 and 40  g in body weight were examined to develop effective techniques to produce river puffer in a non-exchange water system. In Exp I, fish were fed commercial floating feed with 45  % protein one to five times per day to apparent satiation each by hand daily for 8  weeks at 25  °C. In both the 10 - and 40 -g size groups, the final body weight, daily feed consumption, and weight gain of fish fed one meal per day were significantly {{lower than those of}} fish fed five meals per day (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in the final body weight, daily feed consumption, and weight gain among fish fed two, three, and five meals per day. Feed efficiency showed decreasing tendency with increasing size of fish. In Exp II, fish of 10 and 40  g in initial body weight were reared with the commercial feed at 15 – 30  °C for 8  weeks. The weight gain of fish increased with raising water temperature up to 25  °C and decreased drastically at 30  °C for both sizes. The Q 10 of specific growth rate was decreased with raising water temperature from 5. 04 (temperature interval, 15 – 20  °C) to 0. 66 (25 – 30  °C) for the 10 -g fish and from 4. 98 to 0. 31 for the 40 -g fish. In Exp III, the effect of stocking density on growth was examined with fish of 10 and 40  g in initial body weight. The final body weight for initial stocking densities of 4, 8, and 12  kg/m 3 was significantly higher than that of 20  kg/m 3 for the 10 -g fish, and the <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> density reached 10. 1, 19. 2, 28. 7, and 39. 9  kg/m 3, respectively. For the 40 -g fish, the final body weight for initial stocking densities of 3 and 6  kg/m 3 was significantly higher than that of 9 and 15  kg/m 3 and the <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> density reached 7. 38, 13. 5, 17. 1, and 27. 5  kg/m 3, respectively (P[*]<[*] 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractMining {{complexes}} contain multiple sequential {{activities that}} are strongly interrelated. Extracting the material from different sources {{may be seen as}} the first main activity, and any change in the sequence of extraction of the mining blocks modify the activities downstream, including blending, processing and transporting the processed material to <b>final</b> <b>stocks</b> or ports. Similarly, modifying the conditions of operation at a given processing path or the transportation systems implemented may affect the suitability of using a mining sequence previously optimized. This paper presents a method to generate mining, processing and transportation schedules that account for the previously mentioned activities (or stages) associated with the mining complex simultaneously. The method uses an initial solution generated using conventional optimizers and improves it by mean of perturbations associated to three different levels of decision: block based perturbations, operating alternative based perturbations and transportation system based perturbation. The method accounts for geological uncertainty of several deposits by considering scenarios originated from combinations of their respective stochastic orebody simulations. The implementation of the method in a multipit copper operation shows its ability to reduce deviations from capacity and blending targets while improving the expected NPV (cumulative discounted cash flows), which highlight the importance of stochastic optimizers given their ability to generate more value with less risk...|$|R

40|$|Clearwood {{conversions}} {{were linked}} to stand growth using a multiple regression approach. Stand growth of Pinus radiata D.

At 20 years and thereafter annually until 30 years of age, a pruned butt log was theoretically cut from the mean stem and sawn, and clearwood timber grades were calculated and expressed as a percentage of sawn timber volume. A multiple regression model that linked rotation age to clearwood conversions, site productivity, and treatments was developed for GF 22 seedlot. Application of the model to a site of moderate productivity, planted at 800 stems/ha, thinned to 400 stems/ha, and pruned when diameter over stubs measured 180 mm, indicated that a rotation of at least 33 years would be needed to achieve a clearwood production level of 40 %. On extremely low or high productivity sites, rotations of 40 and 25 years respectively were predicted. At a <b>final</b> <b>stocking</b> of 200 stems/ha and under the same practices, rotations of 32, 25, and 17 years were predicted for the low, moderate, and high productivity sites respectively.

50|$|Walker {{spent the}} entire year of 2004 {{splitting}} time as a full-time open-wheel sprint racer and a stock car racer. He joined the USAC Silver Crown Series for Kasey Kahne Racing owned by NASCAR driver and that year's Nextel Cup Rookie of the Year and future Allstate Insurance spokesmodel Kasey Kahne. His lone victory that season came in a Silver Crown race at Nazareth Speedway. He would also be named the Most Improved Driver out of anyone who competed in the USAC Silver Crown Series that year. Walker would slowly begin to transition to the Busch Series by first mastering the time trials segment of the race weekend. To prepare for this, he qualified the #38 Great Clips Dodge entry owned by Akins Motorsports, and driven by his USAC boss and now dear friend Kasey Kahne, on two separate occasions, first at Nashville Superspeedway, and again at Kentucky Speedway, both events coming within seven days or an entire calendar week within each other. To further study for his major-league stock passenger car debut, he competed in another ASA race at Madison International Speedway. Walker started the #70 Terry Kunes Chevrolet twenty-eighth, passed a net total of twenty cars, and finished eighth {{at the conclusion of}} the event, completing all 250 laps. Now fully prepared for the rigors involved in NASCAR racing, Walker made his NASCAR Busch Series debut at Pikes Peak International Raceway, near the famous Pikes Peak in Colorado. He posted an eighth place qualification effort in the #38 Great Clips/Akins Dodge but fell to 27th by the end of the racing session and was fifty laps off of the pace. He chose to attempt his next race with BACE Motorsports, which fielded the #74 Outdoor Channel Chevrolet Monte Carlo and had won three consecutive Busch Series championships in the mid-1990s, when young Walker was but a teenager. In this race, he posted 35th during time trials but did pass five cars to finish 30th in the final running order of the race. In his <b>final</b> <b>stock</b> car start of the season at Memphis Motorsports Park, Walker returned to the Great Clips team. He failed to qualify for the main feature on speed and was forced to take a provisional starting spot.
