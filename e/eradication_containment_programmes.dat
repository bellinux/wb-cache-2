40|$|Determining {{the optimal}} policy {{response}} to a species invasion is a multidimensional problem.

Often, economic evaluation {{is used as a}} basis to underpin policy decisions. However, under certain conditions economic evaluation criteria may provide conflicting results. Deterministic factors, such as rate of spread, degree of damage and the time until detection, are derived for identifying when caution must be taken with the results of economic evaluation criteria.

40|$|Aim: To develop {{approaches}} to the evaluation of programmes whose strategic objectives are to halt or slow weed spread. Location: Australia. Methods: Key aspects {{in the evaluation of}} weed <b>containment</b> <b>programmes</b> are considered. These include the relevance of models that predict the effects of management intervention on spread, the detection of spread, evidence for containment failure and metrics for absolute or partial containment. Case studies documenting either near-absolute (Orobanche ramosa L., branched broomrape) or partial (Parthenium hysterophorus (L.) King and Robinson, parthenium) containment are presented. Results: While useful for informing containment strategies, predictive models cannot be employed in <b>containment</b> <b>programme</b> evaluation owing to the highly stochastic nature of realized weed spread. The quality of observations is critical to the timely detection of weed spread. Effectiveness of surveillance and monitoring activities will be improved by utilizing information on habitat suitability and identification of sites from which spread could most compromise containment. Proof of containment failure may be difficult to obtain. The default option of assuming that a new detection represents containment failure could lead to an underestimate of containment success, the magnitude of which will depend on how often this assumption is made. Main conclusions: Evaluation of weed <b>containment</b> <b>programmes</b> will be relatively straightforward if containment is either absolute or near-absolute and may be based on total containment area and direct measures of containment failure, for example, levels of dispersal, establishment and reproduction beyond (but proximal to) the containment line. Where containment is only partial, other measures of containment effectiveness will be required. These may include changes in the rates of detection of new infestations following the institution of interventions designed to reduce dispersal, the degree of compliance with such interventions, and the effectiveness of tactics intended to reduce fecundity or other demographic drivers of spread. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|When a weed {{invasion}} {{is discovered}} a decision {{has to be}} made as to whether to attempt to eradicate it, contain it or do nothing. Ideally, these decisions should be based on a complete benefit-cost analysis, but this is often not possible. A partial analysis, combining knowledge of the rate of spread, seedbank longevity and economic-analysis techniques, can assist in making the best decision. This paper presents a model to decide when immediate eradication of a weed should be attempted, or whether weed control should be attempted at all. The technique is based on identifying two 'switching points': the invasion size at which it is no longer optimal to attempt eradication, and the invasion size at which it becomes optimal not to apply any form of control. It is shown that seed longevity is a critical factor constraining the feasibility of eradicating large invasions. invasive species, <b>eradication,</b> <b>containment,</b> economics, weed control, switching point, Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{identify}} whether <b>eradication</b> or <b>containment</b> {{is expected}} to be the most cost-effective management goal for an isolated invasive population when knowledge about the current extent is uncertain. Location Global and South Africa. Methods We developed a decision analysis framework to analyse the best management goal for an invasive species population (<b>eradication,</b> <b>containment</b> or take no action) when knowledge about the current extent is uncertain. We used value of information analysis to identify when investment in learning about the extent will improve this decision-making and tested the sensitivity of the conclusions to different parameters (e. g. spread rate, maximum extent, and management efficacy and cost). The model was applied to Acacia paradoxa DC, an Australian shrub with an estimated invasive extent of 310 ha on Table Mountain, South Africa. Results Under the parameters used, attempting eradication is cost-effective for infestations of up to 777 ha. However, if the invasion extent is poorly known, then attempting eradication is only cost-effective for infestations estimated as 296 ha or smaller. The value of learning is greatest (maximum of 8 % saving) when infestation extent is poorly known and if it is close to the maximum extent for which attempting eradication is optimal. The optimal management action is most sensitive to the probability that the action succeeds (which depends on the extent), with the discount rate and cost of management also important, but spread rate less so. Over a 20 -year time-horizon, attempting to eradicate A. paradoxa from South Africa is predicted to cost on average ZAR 8 million if the extent is known, and if our current estimate is poor, ZAR 33. 6 million as opposed to ZAR 32. 8 million for attempting containment. Main conclusions Our framework evaluates the cost-effectiveness of attempting <b>eradication</b> or <b>containment</b> of an invasive population that takes uncertainty in population extent into account. We show that incorporating uncertainty in the analysis avoids overly optimistic beliefs about the effectiveness of management enabling better management decisions. For A. paradoxa in South Africa, attempting to eradicate is likely to be cost-effective, particularly if resources are allocated to better understand and improve management efficacy. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the spatial nature of optimal bioinvasion control. We develop and parameterize a spatially explicit two-dimensional model of species spread {{that allows for}} differential control across space and time, and we solve for optimal control strategies. We find that the qualitative nature of optimal strategies depend in interesting ways on aspects of landscape and invasion geometry. For example, we show that reducing the extent of exposed invasion edge, through spread, removal, or strategically employing landscape features, can be an optimal strategy because it reduces long-term containment costs. We also show that optimal invasion control is spatially and temporally “forward-looking” {{in the sense that}} strategies should be targeted to slow the spread of an invasion in the direction of greatest potential long-term damages.

40|$|Most {{terrestrial}} biological invasions {{occur in}} landscapes comprising numerous, independently managed properties. Thus, control of invasion spread generally {{depends on the}} choices of many managers, each deciding the extent to control invasions on their property. Here we develop a spatially-explicit, integrated model of invasion spread and human behavior to examine how people’s control choices under laissez-faire affect patterns of invasion spread and the total costs and damages imposed by an invader. We evaluate how characteristics of the bioeconomic and social system, including the extent of cooperation among managers, affect the divergence between socially optimal and private control efforts. We find that system-wide invasion externalities generally increase with the potential range size of an invader and with marginal damages from invasion and decrease with marginal control costs and {{with the size of}} the invasion when it is discovered. As expected, private control decisions tend to under-control the invasion relative to socially optimal control. However, we also find that less extensive cooperation is needed to control invasions whose costs and damages otherwise lead to the largest externalities. This novel finding suggests that even small amounts of cooperation can avoid some of the worst invasion outcomes and coordination of control can provide large social benefits.

40|$|E. F. Knipling, on the {{occasion}} of receiving the World Food Prize in 1992, stated that "major advances in coping with most of the major arthropod pest problems will require a change in the tactics and the strategies to manage those pests. They must change for the currently used limited scale, reactive, broad-spectrum measures to preventive approaches that are target specific and applied on an area-wide basis". Since then, practices to manage these pests have hardly changed and pesticide use is still on the rise every year {{to the detriment of the}} environment, human health and the ecosystem. The need for more target specific, sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective control tactics and pest management strategies remains to date more pertinent than ever. Integrated pest management (IPM) aims at the careful integration of several control tactics which are the most opportune for the particular ecosystem, while safeguarding human health and the environment. It has remained the dominant paradigm of pest control over the last half century. IPM can be applied on a field-by-field basis (localised IPM), or against an entire pest population within a delimited geographic area (area-wide (AW-IPM). AW-IPM seeks to treat all habitats, also those that are of no economic interest to the farmer, so that none produces migrants to re-establish significant infestations in areas of concern. This is in contrast to the field-by-field approach that focuses narrowly on defending the valued entity (crop, livestock, people, building, etc.). In most cases, AW-IPM leads to more effective and sustainable management of the insect pest. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a species-specific autocidal control tactic that interferes with the reproductive potential of the target insect pest. It is a very powerful tool that is most effective when insect populations are low and when applied on an area-wide basis. The SIT within an AW-IPM context can be applied for the suppression, <b>eradication,</b> <b>containment</b> or prevention of insect pest populations. There are numerous AW-IPM programmes where the SIT has been used successfully, especially against dipteran and lepidopteran pests, and examples will be given to illustrate this. On economic, environmental and biological grounds, the case for SIT is compelling...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{invasive}} species of mammals in Europe. Invasive mammals have far- reaching impacts both {{on the environment and}} on the economy. It is necessary to avoid the transfer and dissemination of such invasive species in the new environment. To prevent the spread of these species and to control them in general, it is crucial to know their characteristics and to strike at an initial phase of the invasion. The characteristics which make invasive species particularly successful in the new environment are, i. e., wide ecological valence, the ability to disseminate quickly, high competitive potential, and the potential to reproduce in the new environment. Another important factor which contributes to sustained existence of invasive species in the new environment is the absence of predators, parasites, and pathogens. Among the management practices which proved to be effective are shooting, trapping, and baiting, fencing and tree protectors are effective, too. In general, the management should be directed towards long-term reduction of population size to a predefined level based on mitigation of impacts and reduction of management costs.

The most lethal human form of the disease is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite which exhibits a complex life cycle whose asexual or intraerythrocytic stage drives the morbidity and mortality associated with malarial infection. While erythrocytic residency helps the parasite avoid immune detection it also presents the parasite with an environment hostile to its continued development. To combat these challenges the parasite radically alters its host red blood cell (RBC), inducing changes in deformability, cytoadherance, and nutrient uptake. These changes are thought to be driven by the 300 – 400 proteins the parasite is known or predicted to export. However, information about function and interacting partners is available for only a handful of these proteins and thus our understanding of how host-parasite protein-protein interactions affect the development and progression of malaria is woefully incomplete. To allay this problem I have undertaken a series of yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H) screens to identify potential host-parasite protein interactions and thereby generate an interaction map that provides insight into the possible function of several parasite exported proteins. The thesis presented herein will describe the theory, methods, and results of these experiments as well as their possible implications for the malaria infected RBC. ^ A series of three Y 2 H assays of erythrocyte membrane cytoskleton proteins versus P. falciparum activation domain libraries were undertaken. These screens yielded 179 unique interactions between 133 parasite proteins and 13 RBC proteins. Thirty-one of these interactions, representing parasite proteins known or predicted to be exported or parasite proteins with known erythrocyte surface localization were selected for confirmation. Though only 9 (29 %) of these interactions retested, the interaction map provided by these linkages does provide some insight. For example, all of the interactions that retested occurred with erythrocyte proteins belonging to the membrane cytoskeleton ankyrin or junctional complexes. Ankyrin appears to {{play a central role in}} host-parasite protein interactions, accounting for five individual interactions. These interactions and several published reports imply that GBP 130 (the glycophorin binding protein) plays a role in merozoite escape, SURFIN 1. 3 is likely involved in the cytoadhereance of infected RBCs (iRBCs) to endothelial cells, and PFI 0130 c links an undefined surface exposed parasite protein to the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton. MESA, a previously described erythrocyte protein band 4. 1 interactor was shown to bind ankyrin and PF 11 _ 0037 appears to play a role in cytoadherance similar to that of PfEMP 1. Finally PFD 0090 c may be a scaffolding protein that binds both ankyrin and band 4. 1. ...|$|R
30|$|NIST [15, 16] and SANS [17, 18] have {{stressed}} the importance to share security lessons. They require that the insights from previous security breaches are documented, reviewed, presented and integrated back into the incident response process for future improvement. A growing number of regulatory agencies now provide detailed reports that are intended to help avoid any recurrence of previous failures. Security management systems have also been introduced into many healthcare organisations to ensure previous security incidents inform threat and risk assessments [19]. Improving situation awareness, in particular about security breaches, help persuade end users {{of the importance of}} existing policies and procedures. There are further benefits from the wider dissemination of incident reports. Security engineers can learn important lessons about the analysis, <b>containment,</b> <b>eradication,</b> and recovery from previous attacks [16].|$|R
40|$|Most ecologists {{and engaged}} environmentalists justifi-ably regard invasive, {{non-native}} species {{as a leading}} threat to conservation values. In the US, for example, they are reportedly the second greatest threat to native species, outranked only by habitat loss (Wilcove et al. 1998). Increasingly large, though still inadequate, finan-cial resources are being brought to bear in the campaign against alien species. Many conservationists feel that to achieve success resources should be focused on preven-tion, <b>eradication,</b> control, and <b>containment.</b> For various reasons, the “kill them all, always, every-where ” perspective is not shared by a very large segment of society. For every ardent opponent of species introduc-tions there are probably several proponents: {{those who want to}} move species around the globe, or at least into their subsection of it, because they are valuable or edibl...|$|R
40|$|Hazard site {{surveillance}} is {{a system}} for post-border detection of new pest incursions, targeting sites that are considered potentially {{at high risk of}} such introductions. Globalisation, increased volumes of containerised freight and competition for space at domestic ports means that goods are increasingly being first opened at premises some distance from the port of entry, thus dispersing risk away from the main inspection point. Hazard site surveillance acts as a backstop to border control to ensure that new incursions are detected sufficiently early to allow the full range of management options, including <b>eradication</b> and <b>containment,</b> to be considered. This is particularly important for some of the more cryptic forest pests whose presence in a forest often is not discovered until populations are already high and the pest is well established. General requirements for a hazard site surveillance program are discussed using a program developed in Brisbane, Australia, in 2006 as a case study. Some early results from the Brisbane program are presented. In total 67 species and 5757 individuals of wood-boring beetles have been trapped and identified during the program to date. Scolytines are the most abundant taxa, making up 83 % of the catch. No new exotics have been trapped but 19 of the species and 60 % of all specimens caught are exotics that are already established in Australia...|$|R
