25|$|Ensuite, il a commencé à percuter des maisons. Tous les colis des marchandises qui étaient à bord ont fait {{mouvement}} vers l’avant de l’avion. J’ai aperçu à côté de moi un trou par lequel <b>je</b> <b>suis</b> sorti sans savoir comment, et <b>je</b> <b>suis</b> tombé sur une flaque d’eau sablonneuse. J’ai pu alors contempler les flammes de l’avion qui consumait. Il ne s’agissait pas d’un poids exagéré. C’est une simple défaillance mécanique.This translates loosely to the following:We {{had taken}} off after taxiing for three minutes. At once, I noted that the plane started to pitch. The effort of the pilot to right the plane remained vain. At {{this point in time}} the stewardess told me to put on my seat belt. At that time, the plane started to fly low and it struck a palm tree and lost a wing.|$|E
25|$|Some screamo groups, such as Orchid, Reversal of Man, and Circle Takes the Square, {{tend to be}} {{much closer}} to grindcore than their forebears. Other screamo acts have {{incorporated}} post-rock into their music. This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace, atmospheric, harmonic instrumentation, and low-volume vocals. Pianos Become the Teeth, City of Caterpillar, Envy, Funeral Diner, and Le Pré Où <b>Je</b> <b>Suis</b> Mort are examples of post-rock influenced screamo acts.|$|E

25|$|Hawthorne Heights, Story of the Year, Underoath, and Alexisonfire, four bands {{frequently}} {{featured on}} MTV, have popularized screamo. Other American screamo bands include Comadre, Off Minor, Men As Trees, Senses Fail and Vendetta Red. Screamo bands, including Funeral for a Friend and Le Pré Où <b>Je</b> <b>Suis</b> Mort, are popular in Europe. Underoath's albums They're Only Chasing Safety (2004) and Define the Great Line (2006) were certified gold by the RIAA, and the Used's self-titled album (2002) and In Love and Death (2004) were also certified gold.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of these defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et <b>je</b> <b>suis</b> moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir men payset de conserver mon honneur, por écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, {{to listen to your}} proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E
500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et <b>je</b> <b>suis</b> moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E
500|$|Bette's {{relationship}} with Valérie is layered with overtones of lesbianism. Early {{in the book}} Bette is [...] "captée" [...] ("bewitched") by Valérie, and quickly declares to her: [...] "Je vous aime, je vous estime, <b>je</b> <b>suis</b> à vous!" [...] ("I love you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours!") This affection may have been platonic, but neighbors of the Marneffes– along with many readers– suspect that their bond transcends friendship. As with Steinbock, Bette and Valérie assume butch and femme roles; the narration even mentions [...] "Le contraste de la mâle et sèche nature de la Lorraine avec la jolie nature créole de Valérie" [...] ("The contrast between Lisbeth's dry masculine nature and Valerie's creole prettiness"). The homoeroticism evolves through the novel, as Bette feeds on Valérie's power to seduce and control the Hulot men. As one critic says: [...] "Valérie's body becomes, at least symbolically, the locus of Bette's only erotic pleasure." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{father died}} in June 1912, which, {{according}} to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu's correspondence), left him indifferent. By then, Caragiale-son resented Ion Luca's alleged exploitation of his popularity for material gains, and, later in the same year, commented that, [...] "for a small fee", Caragiale-father could be persuaded to read his works at the fair in Obor. In a since-lost piece of his diary that was commented upon by Cioculescu, he also claimed that binge drinking and tobacco abuse had made his father decay physically and mentally. Despite his love for Berlin, he was also dissatisfied with his father's move to the city, and spread the rumor that, {{in the eyes of}} his family and friends, Ion Luca's departure was interpreted as [...] "insane" [...] (while alleging that Caragiale-father was planning to author plays in German, with assistance from Mite Kremnitz, the one-time lover of poet Mihai Eminescu). At the funeral ceremony, he reputedly shocked pianist Cella Delavrancea by coldly stating in French: <b>Je</b> <b>suis</b> venu voir feu mon père ("I came to see my late father").|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of X Factor Indonesia, Anggun was {{recruited}} to judge the other Syco's franchise, Indonesia's Got Talent, in 2014. To prepare for the program, she received instruction from Simon Cowell during the set of Britain's Got Talent. Anggun re-recorded her debut international single as a French-Portuguese duet with Tony Carreira, retitled [...] "La neige au Sahara (Faço Chover No Deserto)", for Carreira's album Nos fiançailles, France/Portugal. The duo performed the song at the 2014 World Music Awards in Monaco, where Anggun was awarded the World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist. In June, Anggun launched her first fragrance, Grace, called after her name in English. In late 2014, Anggun recorded two duets: [...] "Who Wants to Live Forever" [...] with Il Divo for their album A Musical Affair and [...] "Pour une fois" [...] with Vincent Niclo for his album Ce que <b>je</b> <b>suis.</b> Anggun also released [...] "Fly My Eagle" [...] as an original soundtrack for the commercially and critically acclaimed film Pendekar Tongkat Emas. Anggun performed in Africa twice during 2014, for Casa Fashion Show in Casablanca, Morocco, and for the 15th annual French-speaking World Summit in Dakar, Senegal.|$|E
