25|$|With {{regards to}} {{cultural}} {{differences in how}} the genders view infidelity, {{it was observed that}} females found emotional infidelity much more <b>distressful</b> and males found sexual infidelity to be much more <b>distressful</b> than females. A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary et al. 1995).|$|E
25|$|An orphan since youth, Luo Qing {{was raised}} by {{relatives}} and became a soldier. At the age of twenty-eight, for his <b>distressful</b> sentiment of forlornness, he went on a spiritual quest and studied with several teachers, although {{he was unable to}} establish permanent relationships. Only at the age of forty, apparently without a direct guidance of a teacher, he reached enlightenment: awareness to be united with the absolute principle of reality. He began gathering disciples and wrote the Wubuliuce ("Five Instructions in Six Books"), first printed in 1527.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or <b>distressful</b> thoughts from view.|$|E
500|$|The mermaid legend {{extends beyond}} the {{creation}} of the Doom Bar. In 1939 Samuel Williamson declared there are mermaids comparable to Sirens who lie in the shallow waters and draw in ships to be wrecked. In addition, [...] "the <b>distressful</b> cry of a woman bewailing her dead" [...] is said to be heard after a storm where lives are lost on the sandbar.|$|E
2500|$|Other [...] "old fashioned" [...] {{techniques}} are being tested with some success. [...] "Facilitated tucking", swaddling and [...] "kangaroo care" [...] {{have been shown}} to reduce the response of babies to painful or <b>distressful</b> circumstances, while a comprehensive technique of nursing, called [...] "developmental care", has been developed for managing pre-term infants.|$|E
2500|$|Negative perceptions: [...] "Quite often, {{individuals}} have negative perceptions of PAs". [...] Receiving and/or {{the anticipation of}} receiving a PA can be uncomfortable and <b>distressful</b> and potentially cause [...] "tension between supervisors and subordinates". If the person being appraised does not trust their employer, appraiser or believe that they {{will benefit from the}} process it may become a [...] "tick box" [...] exercise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Stead went to London to be {{assistant}} {{editor of the}} Liberal Pall Mall Gazette (a forerunner of the London Evening Standard), where he set about revolutionizing a traditionally conservative newspaper [...] "written by gentlemen for gentlemen". When its editor, John Morley, was elected to Parliament, Stead took over the role (1883–1889). When Morley was made Secretary of State for Ireland, Gladstone asked the new cabinet minister if he were confident that he could deal with that most <b>distressful</b> country. Morley replied that, if he could manage Stead, he could manage anything.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through {{the corner of her eye}} wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This <b>distressful</b> behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E

60|$|Lord Evandale {{soon had}} {{additional}} cause for <b>distressful</b> anxiety. Miss Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Fentolin {{shook his}} head slowly--a <b>distressful</b> gesture. Yet {{all the time he}} had somehow the air of a man {{secretly}} gratified.|$|E
6000|$|The boatman paus'd, methought I heard [...] A child's <b>distressful</b> cry! [...] 'Twas but {{the howling}} wind of night [...] Lord William made reply.|$|E
6000|$|I heard a child's <b>distressful</b> scream [...] The boatman cried again. [...] Nay hasten on--the {{night is}} dark-- [...] And we should search in vain.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{better than}} a tumbled bed," [...] said I, [...] "and some boy of a doctor jabbing you with injections, and <b>distressful</b> people {{hovering}} about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thekla. You did behold {{me in my}} agony. [...] A most <b>distressful</b> {{accident}} occasioned [...] You from {{a stranger}} to become at once [...] 5 [...] My confidant.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she went}} from the place {{in the midst of}} an {{impressive}} stillness, which made the sharper and more <b>distressful</b> to me the clank of those pathetic chains.|$|E
60|$|At this {{he seized}} my coat, grovelled upon my desk, and burst again into <b>distressful</b> weeping. Whatever it was about, I {{said to myself}} that his grief was genuine.|$|E
60|$|The {{origin of}} this <b>distressful</b> thing was this--and I assert here that every fact in the {{following}} résumé can be amply proved by the official records of the General Government.|$|E
6000|$|Behind her {{the patient}} was making <b>distressful</b> sounds. [...] "Doctor Greve," [...] she screamed, and from above she heard the Bavarian {{shouting}} and then the noise of his coming down the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "And--O, I know I shan't do!"--she cried with a <b>distressful</b> laugh. [...] "I accidentally {{learned to}} write round hand instead of ladies'-hand. And, of course, {{you want some}} one who can write that?" ...|$|E
60|$|For an instant, a <b>distressful</b> shadow {{crossed her}} face; but, {{even in the}} start it gave me, it was gone; and she was playing on, and {{looking at me with}} her own calm smile.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not turn}} up his lights; he stood at his draughty broken window, a <b>distressful,</b> slight black outline to the officer who looked ever and again {{into the room and}} exhorted him to rest.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Britling {{returned}} to the Dower House perplexed and profoundly disturbed. He had a <b>distressful</b> sense that things were far more serious with Teddy than {{he had tried to}} persuade Letty they were; that [...] "wounded and missing" [...] meant indeed a man abandoned to very sinister probabilities. He was distressed for Teddy, and still more acutely distressed for Mrs. Teddy, whose every note and gesture betrayed suppositions even more sinister than his own. And that preposterous sense of liability, because he had helped Teddy to get his commission, was more <b>distressful</b> than it had ever been. He was surprised that Letty had not assailed him with railing accusations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it!" [...] yelled Jukes, so {{that every}} head on the Nan-Shan's decks looked towards the bridge. Then he sighed, and with sudden resignation: [...] "It would {{certainly}} be a dam' <b>distressful</b> sight," [...] he said, meekly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my master, if I steal you across, it must {{be under}} force or fear," [...] replied the ferryman; [...] "for else, if John Fenne got wind of it, he were like to prove my most <b>distressful</b> neighbour." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she turned}} herself about, and flung face {{downward}} upon their canvas bed. She did not sob, {{she made no}} sound. She lay still upon her face. After a vast, <b>distressful</b> void her shoulders heaved {{and she began to}} weep silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} mistaken squeamish; but me, I know the most advisable, and have great {{fear of the}} sick which catches," [...] said he. [...] "She is <b>distressful</b> for me. Sacre! Here is more other. To-morrow I consult you. Alors, I go." ...|$|E
60|$|To this <b>{{distress}}ful</b> {{emblem of}} a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.|$|E
60|$|Mose turned red, being {{much more}} embarrassed than Jennie. He was indeed enraged, for it hurt his pride {{to be counted}} a suitor of this ungainly and ignorant girl. Right there he {{resolved}} to flee at the first opportunity. <b>Distressful</b> days were at hand.|$|E
6000|$|It never grew longer, and was {{prompted}} by the feeling that her face was like an April day. The cloud which came on it now was like an April cloud, as if a bright shower of rain must follow. Brushing aside the two <b>distressful</b> lines, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Where all the deep-sea galleons {{ride that}} come to bring the corn, Where falls the fog at eventide and blows the breeze at morn; It's there that I was sick and sad, alone and poor and cold, In yon <b>distressful</b> city beside the Gates of Gold.|$|E
6000|$|Alice Deringham's {{face grew}} a trifle scornful. [...] "You will do your best," [...] she said. [...] "The thought {{of one of}} these half-civilized axemen living at Carnaby is almost <b>distressful</b> to me. In fact, I feel a curious dislike to the man even before I have seen him." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, the Vicar, {{interrupted}} {{in conversation}} with the blacksmith, was amazed to see <b>distressful</b> stranded fish leaping out of a few residual pools, and heaped green weed {{in the bed of}} the stream, where ten minutes before there had been eight feet and more of clear cool water.|$|E
