30|$|Let 〈P,A〉 be an eDatalog^ {{knowledge}} base. The set P^ gr _A can {{be constructed}} in polynomial time and has polynomial <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the <b>size</b> of A. As the truth values of the atoms of external checkable predicates that occur in P^ gr _A can be computed in polynomial time, P_A can also be constructed in polynomial time and has polynomial <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the <b>size</b> of A. It {{is well known that}} the well-founded model of the Datalog^ program P_A∪A {{can be constructed}} in polynomial time and has polynomial <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the <b>size</b> of P_A∪A (see, e.g., [1]). Thus, the well-founded model of 〈P,A〉 can be constructed in polynomial time and has polynomial <b>size</b> <b>in</b> the <b>size</b> of A. Consequently, answering queries to 〈P,A〉 w.r.t. the well-founded semantics can be done in polynomial time <b>in</b> the <b>size</b> of A.|$|R

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal <b>in</b> <b>size.</b> In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the Swahili Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> to Gedi. However, compared to sites similar <b>in</b> <b>size,</b> Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers.|$|E

50|$|The medium {{material}} is usually {{soda lime glass}} or a ceramic. It is usually spherical in form, but angular shapes are also used. For plating, medium usage is usually 1 part medium for every workpiece, but for galvanization the ratio is 2:1. However, various sized media are used in each batch with a typical batch consisting of 50% 4 - 5 <b>in</b> <b>sized</b> beads, 25% 2 - 2.5 <b>in</b> <b>sized</b> beads, and 25% 1 - 1.25 <b>in</b> <b>sized</b> beads.
