She was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the right time to step into the journalistic breach, having moved to Mafeking with her husband, Lt.-Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson, at the start of the war, where he was aide-de-camp to Col. Robert Baden-Powell, the commanding officer at Mafeking. Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.|$|E
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, making sense of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E

He had powerful influence over the line of succession, earning him the nickname [...] "The Kingmaker".

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Stevenage manager Graham Westley sent Morison to a training camp whereby he would work on his pace, and later said [...] "he is improving all the time". He also described him as a player that [...] "no defender would want to play against" [...] due to his height, pace, and strength. In May 2010, Millwall manager Kenny Jackett said that Morison [...] "has a lot of strength and pace, which he uses on defenders perfectly", as well as referring to him as a [...] "physical threat" [...] because of his aerial ability. Nick Szczepanik of The Times stated that Morison plays with [...] "a fearless, all-action style", and that this was emphasised when he [...] "played against Huddersfield Town with his head bandaged to protect a wound that required three stitches".|$|E

[...] For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans. However, Pro-O'Malley parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action, and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century.

500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it. I just happened to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi.

500|$|Aurora is {{voiced by}} American singer Mary Costa, who was 22 {{years old when}} she was cast as the {{character}} in 1952. Costa had grown up a fan of Disney films, the first of which she saw was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. As a child, Costa adored the film so much that she would imitate Snow White by parading around her house wearing a bath towel as a makeshift cape. Costa referred to her garnering the role of Aurora as simply a case of [...] "being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the right time." [...] The filmmakers had long been struggling to cast Aurora, having been searching for the right voice for the character for three years. Disney himself had been preparing to shelve the project less they find a suitable voice actress; he strongly believed that the same person should provide both the character's speaking and singing voices. Costa was attending a dinner party for the entertainment industry, to which she had been invited by a friend who was hoping to introduce her to influential people, where she performed the popular standard [...] "When I Fall in Love". The performance was heard by film composer Walter Schumann who, impressed by her vocals, approached Costa about possibly voicing Aurora and inviting her to audition the following morning. Despite her doubts that she would actually be cast, Costa agreed to audition mostly because she wanted to meet Walt Disney. Upon arriving at the studio the next day, composer George Bruns welcomed Costa by asking her to perform a bird call, which she did successfully. However, being from Knoxville, Tennessee, Costa's strong southern accent nearly prevented her from being cast until she proved that she could sustain a fake British accent for the entire film. The filmmakers likened the situation to English actress Vivien Leigh successfully feigning a southern accent for her role as Scarlet O'Hara in the film Gone With the Wind (1939). Within hours of her audition, Walt Disney himself contacted Costa via telephone to offer her the job, which she immediately accepted.|$|E
