40|$|Abstract. Thermal {{analysis}} {{is a widely}} used analytical technique for materials research. However, thermal analysis with simultaneous evolved gas analysis describes the thermal event more precisely and completely. Among various gas analytical techniques, mass spectrometry has many advantages. Hence, an ultra high vacuum (UHV) compatible mass spectrometry based evolved gas analysis (EGA–MS) system has been deve-loped. This system consists of a measurement chamber housing a mass spectrometer, spinning rotor gauge and vacuum gauges coupled to a high vacuum, high temperature reaction chamber. A commercial thermo-gravimetric analyser (TGA: TG + DTA) is interfaced to it. Additional mass flow based gas/vapour delivery system and calibration gas inlets {{have been added to}} make it a versatile TGA–EGA–MS facility. This system which gives complete information on weight change, heat change, nature and content of evolved gases is being used for (i) temperature programmed decomposition (TPD), (ii) synthesis of nanocrystalline materials, (iii) gas–solid interactions and (iv) analysis of gas mixtures. The TPD of various inorganic oxyanion solids are studied and reaction intermediates/products are analysed off-lin. The dynamic operating conditions are found to yield nanocrystalline products in many cases.

40|$|The metal {{catalyst}} {{plays an}} important role on the catalytic growth. The growth mechanism of silicon nanowires synthesized with several metal catalysts via chemical-vapordeposition (CVD) is discussed by using vaporâ€“liquidâ€“solid (VLS) mechanism. However, the growth of silicon nanowires is chiefly affected by the compound <b>decomposition,</b> <b>gas</b> stream, and temperature difference. Silicon nanowires were fabricated on single crystalline silicon wafer. VLS growth of needle-like silicon nanocones via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition from SiCl 4 and using Ga, Al, Pt, Au, and Pb catalysts are reported. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy reveal different shapes due to differences of metals catalyst. For all of catalysts the nanocones are composed of an oxide shell with a Si core. In this growth mechanism, the gradual etching of the Ga, Al catalyst leads to a gradual decrease of the catalyst volume, and hence the tapered Si nanowire morphology. The growth rates were higher with Pt than with Au under all processing conditions. Also the rate determining step is the incorporation of Si atoms in the lattice at the liquid/solid interfaces and, furthermore, the metal catalysts affect this step, resulting in different activation energy. Using Pb resulting the flower-like SiO 2 nanostructures were formed. Unlike any previously observed results using Ga, Al, Pt, and Au as catalyst, the molten Pb-catalyzed VLS growth exhibits many amazing growth phenomena. The silicon oxide nanowires grow out perpendicularly {{from the surface of the}} metal Pb balls. For each ball, numerous nanowires simultaneously nucleate, grow at nearly the same rate and direction, and simultaneously stop growing.

The model, developed for the B- 61 and W- 80 fireset foam, {{is based on a}} cascade of bondbreaking reactions that produce CO 2. Percolation theory is used to dynamically quantify polymer fragment populations of the thermally degrading foam. The partition between condensed-phase polymer fragments and gas-phase polymer fragments (i. e. vapor-liquid split) was determined using a vapor-liquid equilibrium model. The CPUF decomposition model was implemented into the finite element (FE) heat conduction codes COYOTE and CALORE, which support chemical kinetics and enclosure radiation. Elements were removed from the computational domain when the calculated solid mass fractions within the individual finite element decrease below a set criterion. Element removal, referred to as ?element death,? creates a radiation enclosure (assumed to be non-participating) as well as a decomposition front, which separates the condensed-phase encapsulant from the gas-filled enclosure. All of the chemistry parameters as well as thermophysical properties for the CPUF model were obtained from small-scale laboratory experiments. The CPUF model was evaluated by comparing predictions to measurements. The validation experiments included several thermogravimetric experiments at pressures ranging from ambient pressure to 30 bars. Larger, component-scale experiments were also used to validate the foam response model. The effects of heat flux, bulk density, orientation, embedded components, confinement and pressure were measured and compared to model predictions.

In addition, release results from new tests and the results from the extensive post-irradiation examination work on heated fuel elements are presented. The conclusions obtained in Jül- 2234 are being affirmed and extended. At 1600 °C, fission product release from spherical fuel elements is limited to the contribution of the contamination, since the particles remain intact. An exception to this is Ag 110 m. At 1800 °C, deterioration of the SiC layer can be observed to various degrees leading to cesium release from individual coated particles and the buildup of cesium in the matrix graphite of the fuel element. Release from the sphere is observed only after some delay. Strontium is still strongly retained in fuel kernels and in the matrix graphite. Largest release fractions are observed with silver which diffuses fast through matrix graphite. Starting at 1800 °C, and increasing with higher temperatures, release of fission gases and iodine is getting larger due to occasional pressure induced particle failures and due to SiC corrosion and thermal <b>decomposition.</b> <b>Gas</b> release levels can reach 0. 1 % after heatup to 1800 °C and 14 % after heatup to 2500 °C.

The most important conclusion is that the release of all safety relevant radionuclides is negligible for temperatures up to 1600 °C and heating times up to 500 hours.

In addition, the Raman analysis reveals that the simulated biogas forms structure II hydrate and semiclathrate framework with THF-DMSO and TBAB-DMSO respectively, and CH 4 molecules are only found in the smaller (5 (12)) cages of the mixture hydrates. It is inferred that DMSO just performs as an acid gas solvent during the gas dissolution and diffusion processes but {{not participate in the}} hydrate framework formation.

MDCT scans should be interpreted simultaneously with compositional analysis of intra-cadaveric gases.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) consist of a single graphite sheet seamlessly wrapped into a cylindrical tube, while multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) comprise an array of such nanotubes [15]. A large number of researches have also been held to detect the SF 6 <b>decomposition</b> <b>gases</b> using CNT-based sensors, for the purpose of introducing a novel type of sensors that could be employed as an indicator of current state in GIS. To understand the adsorption mechanism of CNTs and exploit new kinds of CNT-based sensors for safe operation of the power system, the effect of CNTs on specific gases is ought to be evaluated both experimentally and theoretically.|$|R

Herein the thermal decomposition of 14 simple triazines and 16 hydrazo or azo-linked bis triazines were studied using mass spectrometry, permanent gas evolution, and differential scanning calorimetry. At temperatures far above the melting/decomposition point, decomposition was complete. Lower temperatures provided insight into {{the stability of the}} functional groups pendant to the triazine rings. <b>Decomposition</b> <b>gases</b> were identified by chromatography; they indicated little degradation of the triazine rings. The s-triazine ring system appears very stable, resisting decomposition up to 550 oC while its substituents undergo relatively isolated chemistry. Since the discovery of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene over a century ago, nitration of aromatic carbon ring systems has been thoroughly exploited. In an effort to construct more energetic yet stable species, carbon backbones 1, 2 have been abandoned in favor of high-nitrogen, heterocyclic rings. 3 - 6 These compounds derive their energy from larg...|$|R
