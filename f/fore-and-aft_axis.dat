40|$|Viewers exposue to a Virtual Environment (VE) can exhibit {{symptoms}} of motion sickness, such as eyestrain and nausea. This type of motion sickness has {{been referred to}} as cybersickness and is a major ergonomics concern with the use of VEs (Stanney et al., 1998). Literatures show that visual scene movement perceived during navigation in a VE {{plays an important role in}} producing cybersickness. In particular, previous studies have shown that speed of navigation through a VE can significantly affect the levels of cybersickness. The purpose of this research is to study the effects of navigation velocities in different axes on the levels of cybersickness. Due to limitations in resources, the effects of navigation velocities have been studied in only three axes of navigation. Experiment 1 studied the effects of navigating through a VE in different translational axes (i. e., fore-and-aft, lateral, vertical) on cybersickness. Results indicated that navigations in all three translational axes could significantly increase the level of cybersickness as measured by nausea ratings and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores (p< 0. 01). In addition, participants reported significantly lower sickness level with navigation conditions in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> (p< 0. 05) and navigating in lateral or vertical axes in the same VE resulted in similar levels of cybersickness. Later experiments would focus on the effects of navigation velocities in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> and lateral axis. Experiment 2 studied the effects of navigation velocities ranged from 3 m/s r. m. s. to 150 m/s r. m. s. in <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> on level of cybersickness. Experiment 3 studied the effects of navigation velocities in lateral. In both experiments, a significant main effect of velocities on levels of cybersickness was found (p< 0. 01) and a nonlinear relationship between navigation velocities in fore-and-aft or lateral axis and levels of cybersickness was identified. Since a previous study has shown that exposures to an oscillating VE in different rotating axes result in similar levels of cybersickness, this research studies the effects of navigation velocties in only one rotational axis: the yaw axis. Experiment 4 studied the effects of navigation velocities in yaw axis on levels of cybersickness. A significant main effect of navigation velocities on cybersickness was found (p< 0. 01) and a nonlinear relationship between navigation velocities in yaw axis and levels of cybersickness was identified. The experimental findings are compared with the past literature concerning visually induced motion sickness with rotating drums. In particular, the consistency among the findings was discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of navigation speed {{on the level of}} motion sickness during and after a 30 -min head-steered virtual environment. Root-mean-squares for 8 speeds in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> were 3, 4, 6, 8. 10, 24, 30, and 59 m/s. Participants were 96 Chinese men. Both the nausea and vection ratings increased significantly with speeds increasing from 3 m/s to 10 m/s. At speeds exceeding 10 m/s, the ratings stabilized. Navigation speeds were found to significantly affect the onset times of vection and nausea but did not affect their rates of increase with duration of exposure. For the various Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores, navigation speed had a significant influence on only the oculomotor subscore. Actual or potential applications of this research include the prediction of sickness associated with simulation tours in a virtual environment at different navigation speeds...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. At times, people exposed to moving visual scenes may perceive themselves as moving even though they are, in fact, stationary. This sensation is sometimes experienced by people sitting in a railway carriage, in a station, when a neighbouring train slowly pulls away. Rather than sensing that the other train is leaving the station, they have the compelling feeling that their own train {{is moving in the}} opposite direction. This phenomenon, the feeling of moving brought about solely by a change in the visual scene, is called vection. Sustained exposure to moving visual scenes may not only produce vection, but can also provoke signs and symptoms of motion sickness such as dizziness, sweating, stomach awareness, and nausea and these adverse effects are now generally termed "visually induced motion sickness" (VIMS). VIMS is frequently reported in a variety of simulated or virtual environments such as flight and driving simulators, as well as in other contexts, such as at the cinema. It not only constitutes a nuisance to the user of these technologies, but also limits the usability of these technologies. Unlike other forms of motion sickness, such as seasickness, little is known about what conditions, or what aspects of moving visual scenes, are particularly provocative. Furthermore, research conducted thus far has generally investigated rotational motion patterns that are not representative of motion typically encountered in the real world. As a consequence, the work presented here has investigated the interrelationship between visual stimulus characteristics, VIMS, and vection during simulated forward and backward selfmotion (Le. along the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis).</b> In the first study, individuals were exposed to moving visual scenes that induced an illusion of motion in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis.</b> These were presented either at a constant speed, or at a sinusoidally varying speed. Although varying the speed was expected to lead to higher levels of VIMS, this was not observed. The absence of an increased level of VIMS was hypothesised to be a consequence of the particular frequency employed (0. 025 Hz). The frequency dependence of VI MS was then tested in a series of experiments. Noting that amplitude and acceleration covaried with frequency, it was found that within the range 0. 025 - 1. 6 Hz, VIMS peaked at 0. 2 Hz. Using motion profiles with varying amplitude and acceleration, studies employing angular motion stimulation, on the other hand, had previously shown a peak in VIMS to occur at a frequency of approximately 0. 06 Hz. This suggests that results obtained with angular motion stimulation cannot be extrapolated to scenarios involving linear motion stimulation in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis.</b> The studies thus far isolated the effect of stimulus characteristics by preventing eye movements from occurring by means of fixation. A further study was conducted with the express purpose of investigating the effect of gaze shifting. It was found that the level of VIMS significantly increased with fixation away from the focus of expansion of a radial display. This suggests that the visual stimulus interacts differently with different portions of the retina. Real-world motion scenarios generally entail motion along different axes simultaneously. Most studies into VIMS have been restricted to single-axis motion and, although VIMS is assumed to increase with more complex motion scenarios, little is known about how VIMS changes withÂ·increasing complexity. Comparing single- versus dual-axis motion, it was unexpectedly found that dualaxis motion did not lead to higher levels of VIMS, challenging the generally held assumption that VIMS is proportional to the degree of sensory conflict. The feasibility of predicting the incidence of VIMS based on an individual's motion sickness history as assessed by the revised Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ) was finally explored. Correlation coefficients were comparable to those observed with true motion suggestive of a common underlying mechanism between different forms of motion sickness. For the prediction of individual behaviour, the MSSQ was found to be of limited value in its current form.. A general finding was that vection consistently preceded the occurrence of VIMS, in line with the idea that vection is a necessary condition for VIMS to occur. This implies that future displays optimising the simulation of self-motion are likely to result in higher levels of VIMS. In addition, the findings that frequency, gaze direction, and multi-axis motion affected VIMS differently with simulated motion in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> as compared to angular motion profiles, indicate that angular motion commonly used to study VIMS may be of limited value...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{velocity}} (SV), {{a product}} of scene complexity and navigation velocity, is a metric to quantify virtual scene movement {{for the study of}} visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) (So et al., 2001). As SV increases, VIMS increases, peaks, and then decreases. Watching VIMS provoking stimuli of similar SV is hypothesized to produce similar levels of vection and VIMS. An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis. Ten participants were exposed to five visual motion oscillating along <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> at different frequencies (from 0. 05 to 0. 8 Hz). The r. m. s. velocity was kept constant and the frequency changes were achieved by changing the amplitudes of oscillation. These five stimuli had similar SVs. To our surprise, participants reported significantly different vection as the frequency increased even though the SVs were kept the same (p < 0. 001). Levels of VIMS was not significantly different because the exposure duration was too short (20 seconds). A second experiment using stimuli with 30 minutes was conducted. Preliminary results indicated that levels of nausea significantly changed when viewers were exposed to visual oscillations with similar SVs but different frequency. Modifications to the previously reported SV metric are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Closed access. The {{majority}} of studies into visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) either use complex motion scenarios or {{are limited to}} single-axis motion. This study compared VIMS during single- and dual-axis motion. Twelve participants were exposed to (i) oscillating roll motion, (ii) linear motion in the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis,</b> and (iii) spiral motion, i. e. the summed direction of both of these flow vectors. Increased sensory conflict during exposure to spiral motion was hypothesised to increase the level of VIMS compared with exposure to its constituent motion patterns in isolation. Unexpectedly, spiral motion was {{not found to be}} more provocative than either of the two single-axis motion patterns, and this finding appears to be inconsistent with VIMS being determined by simple summation of the provocative stimuli. In the spiral motion condition, an atypical decrease in VIMS was observed during exposure, which was consistently preceded by a reduction in reported vection. It was hypothesised that the abstract nature as well as the unusual motion profile in the spiral motion condition may have rendered the stimulus increasingly âimprobableâ and ultimately being disregarded, or âquarantinedâ, as an orientation cue by the central nervous system. The results are discussed in the context of methodological consequences for VIMS research and potential limitations of the use of abstract stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether speed and road conditions have an effect on the physiological stability of sick and preterm babies undergoing inter-hospital transfer by ambulance. Study Design This was a quantitative observational study using primary data. The study compared the stability of physiological parameters (heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation) against speed and g forces experienced in three dimensions, longitudinal direction (x-axis), lateral (y-axis) and vertical direction (z-axis). Data was collected using a DL 1 Raceâtechnology device with a 5 Hz GPS receiver and digital accelerometer to measure the forces acting on the baby. Data was collected from twelve babies undergoing ambulance transfer between neonatal or paediatric units in the North West of England in a neonatal intensive care incubator mounted on an ambulance trolley. Seven complete data sets were analysed. Physiological variability was compared between the two types of road conditions: motorways and other roads. Results The babies demonstrated more stability during motorway journeys, though predictable situations in the journey promoted instability. Speed was not a factor in physiological instability, but acceleration and deceleration exerted pronounced effects on physiological status, particularly when combined with marked lateral forces. Other changes in physiological status during apparently stable transit require further investigation, as does the optimum positioning of the baby along or across the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis</b> of the ambulance. This was the first study to investigate real-time physiological effects on live neonates during required transfer journeys including measurements in three axes throughout the episode while exerting no research effect on the babies...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} judge the speeds of background motion {{is crucial for}} many daily tasks, such as driving. While viewers who experienced illusion of self-motion (vection) tend to overestimate {{the speed of a}} moving object (i. e., positive perceived speed bias (PSB) : Gray and Regan, 2000), {{little is known about the}} effect of vection on speed perception of a moving visual background. Experiment: In this study, vection was provoked by viewing a wide field-of-view (horizontal: 220 Â° x vertical: 56 Â°) radial checker-board pattern oscillating in sinusoidal motions along the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>axis.</b> There were 5 x 5 full-factorial experimental conditions studying different combinations of RMS velocities (from 11 m/s to 178 m/s) and oscillation frequencies (from 0. 05 Hz to 0. 8 Hz). Subjects were required to estimate their perceived vection as well as their perceived speeds of the visual background motion using a ratio-scale method with a reference stimulus (0. 2 Hz with 44 m/s). Ten subjects completed four repetitions for each condition. Results: In general, perceived vection was not significantly correlated with PSB (Spearman: rho=. 017, p=. 584). However, when frequencies were lower (below 0. 2 Hz) or velocities were higher (above 89 m/s), the presence of vection was associated with significantly higher positive PSB (Spearman: rho>. 2, p<. 01). We also observed that frequency of the stimuli had significant effects on PSB as well as on vection perception which were opposite to the effects of velocity. In short, impacts of frequency and velocity were in opposition. Conclusion: The presence of vection encouraged the viewers to increase their perceived speeds but such effect was modulated by both frequency and velocity of the background motion...|$|E
