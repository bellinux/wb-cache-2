This variation of speed of the motor, in addition to the variable speed from the transmission, allowed a wide range of speed for the Union automobile. The transmission was enclosed in a <b>dustproof</b> casing and run in oil. One lever controlled two forward speeds and one reverse. The high speed was 20 mi/h km/h.|$|E

5000|$|An iconic post {{military}} {{watch and}} {{a result of}} the Navy's FSX-797, colloquially known as the US Navy's Bureau of Ships [...] "canteen watch", started out with Jacques Depollier & Sons's waterproof and <b>dustproof</b> strap watch. The first known example of the now common [...] "screw down crown", unlike later examples of the canteen watch, this one lacked the emblematic chain anchoring the crown to the watch. One unusual feature of this watch was the heat disk {{on the back of the}} case to prevent the heat from the wearer's wrist from causing the oil in the watch to drip out of the jewel holes. Depollier ads claim that the US Army Signal Corps used the case to protect watch movement stores in long-term storage. The gasketed and spring-loaded screw-down crown is kept on the case by two flanges on the crown held against two grooves on the case. [...] US Navy Bureau of Ships specification 18W8, published in December 1944. A matte black metal dial, two vertical luminous dots over 12, along with one for every other hour, the hour and minute hand, as well as the tip of the second hand covered in radium lume. With war shortages, the case was made of chromed base metal. A koroseal gasket is used inside the crown. The crystal is tempered glass with a metal rim soldered to the case creating a watertight seal. The 17-jewel sweep-second movement is covered by another koroseal gasket under the caseback.|$|E
40|$|Wild silk has {{properties}} of waterproof and <b>dustproof,</b> but its domestic partner has neither. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{was used to}} observe and compare their morphology difference so that the possible mechanism can be elucidated. By the contrastive research, this paper concludes that the mechanism of waterproof and <b>dustproof</b> of wild silk is due to selective repulsion, each hierarchical cascade of nanoparticles can repel either water molecules or fine particles in air. The SEM study reveals that the different nanoparticles with hierarchical structure on the silk surface are main factors of the highly selective repulsion. This theory can also explain the waterproof property of lotus leaf. A {{better understanding of the}} repulsion mechanism of wild silk could help the further design of bio-mimetic waterproof/dustproof artificial materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. On {{account of}} the serious damage case of {{electron}} gun packaged by using the PE or PVC plastic trays during long-distance distribution, the new-type packages of corrugation paperboard bracket (one layer, two layers and three layers) are developed for the protective packaging of electron gun, which have the advantages of compact structure with placement, orientation and fixation, favorable stability, count, and <b>dustproof</b> function for electron guns. The verification and comparison {{by a series of}} comparison experiments on drop shocks and sine vibrations prove that the improved packages have favorable package cushioning and vibration-proof performances, and can provide effective protection for the products of electron gun during storage and transportation. Moreover the new-type packages have the advantages of compact structure with placement, orientation and fixation, favorable stability, count and <b>dustproof</b> function for electron guns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nanopore on {{a surface}} (e. g. the {{epidermis}} of a leaf) can absorb nanoparticles, and nanoparticles on a surface play a contrary role.
