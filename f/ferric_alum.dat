50|$|Several {{chemicals}} {{can eliminate}} cyanobacterial blooms from water-based systems. They include: calcium hypochlorite, copper sulphate, cupricide, and simazine. The calcium hypochlorite amount needed {{varies depending on}} the cyanobacteria bloom, and treatment is needed periodically. According to the Department of Agriculture Australia, a rate of 12 g of 70% material in 1000 l of water is often effective to treat a bloom. Copper sulfate is also used commonly, but no longer recommended by the Australian Department of Agriculture, as it kills livestock, crustaceans, and fish. Culpricide is a chelated copper product that eliminates blooms with lower toxicity risks than copper sulfate.

Thus, Penrose and Quastel (1) have used a gravimetric determina-tion, based on the reaction of PPA with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine, which, however, lacks specificity.

If nutrient leaching into the bag filtrate could be minimized through coagulant selection, then geotextile bags could provide a convenient and effective method to dewater waste biosolids and provide them in a form that fish farmers could readily transport, store, or send for disposal. Results from replicate geotextile bag filter tests indicate that when <b>alum,</b> <b>ferric</b> chloride, and hydrated lime (plus a polymer) were amended to a backwash flow, both suspended solids capture and solids thickening were improved; i. e., total suspended solids removal rates of 95. 8, 95. 1, and 96. 0 %, respectively, were achieved along with final dewatered filter cake percent solids concentrations of 22. 1, 19. 3, and 20. 9 %, respectively. <b>Alum,</b> <b>ferric</b> chloride, and hydrated lime (plus a polymer) amended geotextile bags were not as effective in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and cBOD 5 removal, resulting in removal rates of 69. 6, 67. 2, and 35. 3 %, respectively, and 56. 6, 9. 3, and − 47. 4 %, respectively.

Oocyst viability was assessed by in vitro excystation and by a viability assay based on the exclusion or inclusion of two fluorogenic vital dyes. Although desiccation {{was found to be}} lethal, a small proportion of oocysts were able to withstand exposure to temperatures as low as - 22 degrees C. The water treatment processes investigated did not affect the {{survival of}} oocysts when pH was corrected. However, contact with lime, <b>ferric</b> sulfate, or <b>alum</b> {{had a significant impact on}} oocyst survival if the pH was not corrected. Oocysts demonstrated longevity in all water types investigated, including seawater, and when in contact with feces were considered to develop an enhanced impermeability to small molecules which might increase the robustness of the oocysts when exposed to environmental pressures...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The Micro-X Imaging X-ray Spectrometer is a {{sounding}} rocket payload slated for launch in 2011. An array of transition edge sensors {{will be used}} to obtain high resolution X-ray spectra of astronomical sources. An Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) forms the heart of the instrument’s cryogenic system. It consists of a <b>Ferric</b> Ammonium <b>Alum</b> (FAA) salt pill in the bore of a low current 4 T superconducting magnet. The detector array is accommodated inside a magnesium housing which is thermally connected to the FAA salt. A bath of superfluid helium functions as a heat sink for the ADR. The helium tank is suspended inside a lightweight aluminum vacuum vessel by a set of reentrant G 10 thrust tubes. The cryogenic system has been designed to withstand the extreme structural loads encountered in rocket flight, {{while at the same time}} providing hold-times sufficiently long to facilitate convenient operation during the launch campaign. Due to the short duration of a {{sounding rocket}} flight, the thermal recovery time constant of the cold mass had to be kept on the order of only a few seconds. In addition, special attention has been paid to minimizing the heating of the cold stage due to the dissipation of vibration originating from the rocket motor. The assembly of the Micro-X cryogenic system has been completed, and performance tests have been carried out. The design of the Micro-X cryogenic system and the results of the performance tests are presented here-in...|$|R
40|$|Pulp and Paper mills are {{generating}} {{millions of}} tons of wastewater and are major source of water pollution. In this research work, pulping wastes have been characterized and found to contain very high COD, TSS and colour. Coagulation–flocculation process was performed to find out the performance of different coagulants and flocculants like <b>alum,</b> <b>ferric</b> chloride, aluminium chloride, ferrous sulphate, poly aluminium chloride (PAC), cationic and anionic polyacrylamide polymers in individual form as well as in different combinations. The effects of dosing rate, settling time and pH were examined for reduction of COD, TSS and colour. Coagulants used in combinations were found to be more effective in reducing COD, TSS and colour instead of using individual form. The initial pH of the effluent for coagulation process was found to have remarkable effect on COD, TSS and colour removal. The most effective results were found using cationic and anionic polyacrylamide combination with ferric chloride and aluminium chloride and reduction of 76 % COD, 95 % TSS and 95 % colour were observed at pH <  3...|$|R
