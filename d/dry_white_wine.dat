25|$|The acidity of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{is reduced}} by {{slightly}} salty or sweet dishes while the wine accentuates the salty side of food and tempers heavy fatty foods. Sweet wine goes well with sweet and savoury dishes to mitigate the heavy sugar and stimulate the fruitiness.|$|E
25|$|Part of European {{trade was}} by sea along the Atlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians from their demand for wine, created a craze for {{planting}} between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> was produced for export from La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the Garonne. When wine production was introduced {{on the banks}} of the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> popular with the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current areas of Muscadet AOC and Gros-plant AOVDQS in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west had their sales network thanks to the navigability of the Loire and the Garonne.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{are made}} {{throughout}} the region, using the regional appellation Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC {{is used for}} wines made in appellations that only allow red <b>wines.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>whites</b> from Graves are the most well-known {{and it is the}} only subregion with a classification for <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence. In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{exceptions}} to the general rule of Bordeaux AOC as simpler <b>wines</b> are some <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> produced in Médoc and Sauternes, where the production of red and sweet wines dominate. In difference from most of Graves, these areas {{are not allowed to}} use any other designation than Bordeaux Blanc AOC for <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Thus, some very ambitious and expensive <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> such as Château Margaux's Pavillon Blanc and Château d'Yquem's [...] "Y" [...] have to be classified as [...] "simple" [...] Bordeaux Blancs.|$|R
5000|$|Jasnières <b>wines</b> are <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{produced}} from Chenin blanc grapes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is a wine without sugar (the sugar {{ratio is}} {{generally}} less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine {{very difficult to}} develop because {{the balance of the}} wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol. This is the wine that the consumer refers to when he speaks of white wine without giving further details.|$|E
25|$|Entre-deux-mers (literally, {{between two}} seas) is a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> made in Bordeaux. The {{appellation}} {{is one of}} the largest in the Bordeaux region and is situated between the Garonne and the Dordogne (which are actually considered inland seas). The area is responsible for three quarters of the red wine sold under the generic Bordeaux AOC or Bordeaux supérieur labels.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation starts spontaneously {{under the}} action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The {{winemaker}} can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20°C or even 25°C.|$|E
50|$|Red, rosé and <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> are {{produced}} in the IGP Charentais.|$|R
50|$|According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Albanella {{tends to}} produce <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> that have notable aging potential.|$|R
5000|$|Bergerac AOC: <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> rosé {{wines and}} red wines. These are wines {{that can be}} enjoyed young (from two years old).|$|R
25|$|Many wine-producing {{countries}} produce white wine, {{however the}} white grape needs less heat than red grapes to ripen: {{the lack of}} maturity of tannins {{is not a problem}} since they are not extracted in pressing. In addition the taste balance is based on a significant liveliness due to the acidity. The grapes for the production of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> are harvested just before ripening. These production conditions can result in a more northerly or mountainous location for the vineyard producing dry white wines.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means to}} balance the fat white wine is {{involved}} in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, béarnaise sauce, marinara sauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.|$|E
25|$|Vienna, {{along with}} Paris, Santiago, Cape Town, Prague, Canberra, Bratislava and Warsaw , {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} world capital cities with its own vineyards. The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as Heuriger, which are especially numerous in the wine growing areas of Döbling (Grinzing, Neustift am Walde, Nußdorf, Salmannsdorf, Sievering), Floridsdorf (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), Liesing (Mauer) and Favoriten (Oberlaa). The wine is often drunk as a Spritzer ("G'spritzter") with sparkling water. The Grüner Veltliner, a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.|$|E
50|$|The Grüner Veltliner is the {{dominant}} grape varietal cultivated in Austria, and the <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> produced from this grape have gained international recognition.|$|R
50|$|Luxembourg mainly {{produces}} <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{and sparkling}} wine under the designation Crémant. There {{are also some}} rosé and red wines made, {{as well as some}} sweet wines.|$|R
25|$|Overall, {{more or less}} <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{are most}} common among the {{sparkling}} wines, but sparkling rosé and red wines are also produced, as well as wines of varying sweetness.|$|R
25|$|Grape {{maturity}} {{depends on}} the requirement of the final product. For a sweet white wine, whether fortified or natural, sugar is the key criterion. For a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> technological maturity is calculated and the fruit is harvested just before (usually eight days) the maturity of the sugar. At this point the relationship between sugar and acid is optimal. Further, low acidity will cause the future wine to be unbalanced with excess alcohol and lack of liveliness. In addition, the flavour will be less fresh and less vivid.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of white wine, <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is the most common. More or less {{aromatic}} and tangy, it {{is derived from the}} complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of Noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} taken when {{consuming}} oysters. Purists insist on eating them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with a home-made Mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include: Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral/nutritional content influence their flavor profile.|$|E
5000|$|Roussette de Savoie's high acidity {{give it the}} {{potential}} to age. These <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> typically have a nose of violet and mountain herbs with flavors of minerals, bergamot, honey and hazelnut.|$|R
50|$|Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh Sec, {{which are}} <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> {{must be made}} from grapes with a minimum {{potential}} alcohol level of 11%, and contain no more than 3 grams per liter of residual sugar.|$|R
25|$|Würzburg is {{also the}} capital of the German wine region Franconia which is famous for its mineralic <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{especially}} from the Silvaner grape. Würzburger Hofbräu brewery also locally produces a well-known pilsner beer.|$|R
2500|$|Airén B: {{a little-known}} variety, {{yet it is}} the most planted vat wine in the world with 390,000 hectares. It is second only to the sultana. Grown almost {{exclusively}} in Spain, it is planted in a low density and produces a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> consumed locally ...|$|E
2500|$|The grapevines {{around the}} town of Chablis make a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> renowned for the purity of its aroma and taste. In {{comparison}} with the white wines {{from the rest of}} Burgundy, Chablis wine has typically much less influence of oak. Most basic Chablis is unoaked, and vinified in stainless steel tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fashion of}} {{drinking}} cheap <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> started in Paris in the 18th century: {{to evade the}} excise duty the Parisians took the habit of going to drink their wine at the producers premises outside {{the walls of the}} city. Cabarets opened their doors by the river, becoming Guinguettes (similar to taverns): so the wine that was drunk there was also called [...] "guinguet". This is a wine from the hills of the Seine or the Marne, sour, but the conditions of transport of the time did not allow it to be used prematurely.|$|E
50|$|Rich, <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{are also}} {{produced}} from {{a blend of}} Marsanne and Roussanne. These wines are also usually left to age, for up to 15 years. Vin de paille or Straw Wine is also produced in this region.|$|R
50|$|Château Talbot {{produces}} three wines; an eponymous grand vin, {{a second}} wine called Connétable de Talbot released since the 1979 vintage, respectively aged 15 and 12 months in oak barrel, {{and one of}} the Médoc's oldest <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> Caillou Blanc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{are mainly}} {{a blend of}} Sémillon with Sauvignon blanc, Sauvignon gris and Muscadelle, to which Ugni blanc, Ondenc and Chenin blanc are {{sometimes}} added. These combinations lead {{to the creation of}} fruity, <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> that can be powerful, and of medium-sweet or sweet wines that are aromatic and powerful.|$|R
2500|$|Chardonnay is {{the only}} {{permitted}} AOC grape variety in the Chablis region, with the wines there developing such worldwide recognition that the name [...] "Chablis" [...] has taken on somewhat generic connotations to mean any <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> even those not made from Chardonnay. The name is protected in the European Union and for wine sold in the EU, [...] "Chablis" [...] refers only to the Chardonnay wine produced in this region of the Yonne [...] The region sits on the outer edges of the Paris Basin. On {{the other side of}} the basin is the village of Kimmeridge in England, which gives its name to the Kimmeridgean soil that is located throughout Chablis. The French describe this soil as argilo-calcaire and is a composition of clay, limestone, and fossilized oyster shells. The most expensive examples of Chardonnay from Chablis come from the seven Grand Cru vineyards that account for around [...] on the southwest side of one slope along the Serein River near the towns of Chablis—Blanchots, Bougros, Les Clos, Grenouilles, Preuses, Valmur, and Vaudésir. The wines from these crus most often capture the goût de pierre à fusil or [...] "gunflint" [...] quality that is characteristic of Chablis wine.|$|E
50|$|In smaller quantities, {{the estate}} {{produces}} the <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> Les Jardins de Thinoy, the <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> Isis, the demi-sec Osiris, {{and the red}} wine Cru de Cinquet.|$|E

50|$|Palmela first gained {{attention}} for its off <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> made from Muscat grapes harvested early but has recently turned {{its attention to}} producing <b>dry</b> red and <b>white</b> table <b>wines.</b> The soil of {{the area of the}} former Arrábida IPR is predominately limestone with good drainage potential for the cultivation of red wine varieties.|$|R
50|$|As with Médoc, Cabernet Sauvignon is the {{predominant}} grape, but a somewhat {{greater proportion of}} Merlot is typically used in the blend, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. The <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> are a blend of Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon.|$|R
50|$|The Cheverny AOC, {{which was}} also {{recognized}} in 1997, covers a wider area but also includes the commune of Cour-Cheverny. The wines produced under this appellation are <b>dry,</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> (the main grape variety being Sauvignon blanc), and red and rosé wines (the main grape variety being Gamay).|$|R
