40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>crabs</b> (Carcinus maenas) are an {{invasive}} species documented as having negative {{impacts on the}} biota of marine and estuarine communities. However, {{their impact on the}} American lobster (Homarus americanus) is not well understood. During a two-year trap study (2013 – 2014) in The Great Bay Estuary, NH, we captured 1229 <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> and 144 lobsters in 248 individual trap hauls (average catch per unit effort = 10. 98 ± 1. 51 for <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> and 0. 49 ± 0. 08 for lobsters), or ∼ 8. 5 times more <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> than lobsters. In general, <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> were more abundant in areas furthest from the coast (up-estuary), which also tended to be warmer, while lobsters were more abundant in areas closer to the coast (down-estuary). Nevertheless, there was still considerable overlap between the two species.

40|$|A strong {{cohort of}} young European <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> (Carcinus maenas) {{appeared}} in North American embayments from Oregon {{to the west}} coast of Vancouver Island following the strong El Niño of 1997 / 1998. Unusually, strong north-moving coastal currents transported crab larvae from established source populations in California to the Pacific Northwest. Since then, both coastal transport and recruit-ment of young <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> have been weaker. Although it was predicted that <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> would become extinct in the Pacific Northwest once the original colonists died of senescence at about age 6, this has not happened. Age-class analysis and the appearance of young crabs evidence the existence of local recruitment in the Pacific Northwest, especially after warm winters. An extensive survey by Fisheries and Oceans Canada found populations of <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> on the west coast of Vancouver Island, with densities of. 2 per trap in some inlets. However, no <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> were found in the inland sea between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Therefore, outreach efforts should continue to prevent the establishment of this invader in those waters via ballast water or shellfish transport...|$|R

25|$|The natural predators of C.sapidus include eels, drum, striped bass, spot, trout, some sharks, humans, cownose rays, and whiptail stingrays. C.sapidus is an omnivore, eating both {{plants and}} animals. C.sapidus {{typically}} consumes thin-shelled bivalves, annelids, small fish, plants and nearly any other item it can find, including carrion, other C.sapidus individuals, and animal waste. C.sapidus {{may be able}} to control populations of the invasive <b>green</b> <b>crab,</b> Carcinus maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C. maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where C.sapidus is most frequent.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{responses}} of the colour forms of Carcinus maenas to salinity variation were investigated, and related to their physiology and distribution in an estuary. Red males, characterised by a thicker carapace were unable to survive in as low salinities as green males; this was reflected in their poorer osmoregulatory capabilities. Haemolymph osmolality and ion concentrations of red crabs decreased {{at a faster rate}} and reached lower levels than in <b>green</b> <b>crabs.</b> Haemolymph osmolality and choice behaviour did not vary with size. In the tidally mixed estuary male and female crabs occurred in roughly similar proportions. Most were green and generally smaller than their open shore counterparts. Migration out of the estuary in winter was reversed in late spring. Differences in salinity tolerance of red and <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> were reflected in salinity preference behaviour. <b>Green</b> <b>crabs</b> persisted longer in the lowest range of salinities tested, especially if a shelter was available. Prior acclimation affected the timing of choice behaviour; the lower the salinity of acclimation the faster the time of exit from the lowest range of salinities tested, and vice versa. Estuarine <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> exhibited endogenous locomotor activity of circatidal periodicity and were less responsive to episodes of low salinity than open shore red and <b>green</b> <b>crabs.</b> Constant low salinity initiated a rhythm of circatidal periodicity in arhythmic red and <b>green</b> crabs; red <b>crabs</b> reacted faster and were more active upon salinity change than <b>green</b> <b>crabs.</b> The amount of locomotor activity induced after prior acclimation was similar within each acclimation salinity tested. Carcinus detected salinity variation by responding to the concentrations of Na and Cl in seawater, and was able to differentiate between salinities separated by as little as 0. 5 ppt., - General physiological changes appear to occur before behavioural responses are mediated; they probably act as cues for the behavioural responses, which appear not to be triggered by specific receptors.

40|$|Changes in prey species {{availability}} {{can present}} energetic challenges to wintering western North American harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). The {{goal of this}} study was to examine the feeding behavior of captive harlequins and compare energy and nutrient contents of native crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis to invasive exotic crab, Carcinus maenas. Intake rate, gut retention time, and assimilation efficiency did not differ between <b>crab</b> species. <b>Green</b> <b>crabs</b> had significantly larger (P= 0. 0034) meat-to-carapace ratio, 79 % greater (P= 0. 0168) fat, and 15 % greater (P= 0. 0058) energy than yellow shore crabs. Yellow shore crabs required 130 % more (P= 0. 0301) force for carapace failure. Gross energy intake rate and assimilable energy intake rate did not differ between crab species. Therefore, energetically and nutritionally, <b>green</b> <b>crabs</b> provide a viable food option to harlequins, if yellow shore crabs are not available.

25|$|The {{invasive}} <b>green</b> <b>crab,</b> Carcinus maenas, {{can turn}} off top down control by facilitating {{the recovery of}} salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, Sesarma reticulatum, can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results are encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.|$|E

Roughly 10 years ago, another exotic crab species (the Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus) became established in the same habitats. This investigation focuses on (1) how the Asian shore crab successfully invaded rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England during the 19902 ̆ 7 s, and (2) how the Asian shore crab is affecting other resident organisms (including C. maenas) in invaded habitats. The first goal was achieved by studying guilds of co-occurring crabs in native (Tanabe Bay, Japan) and invaded (Long Island Sound, USA) habitats of H. sanguineus. Analyses revealed that patterns of resource utilization by H. sanguineus were very similar in both locations. Furthermore, there was little overlap in resource use between H. sanguineus and other co-occurring crabs in invaded habitats. Such ecological factors likely contributed to the invasion success of H. sanguineus in southern New England.
