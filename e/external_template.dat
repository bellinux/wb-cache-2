We extract the tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) from simulated sky maps consisting of CMB, noise (2 micro K arcmin), and a foreground model, and find that, even for the simplest 3 -frequency configuration with 60, 100, and 240 GHz, the residual bias in r is as small as Delta r~ 0. 002. This bias is dominated by the residual synchrotron emission due to spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral index.

This give rise to well-defined functional properties and facilitate control over their supramolecular organization. The solid-state properties of organic electronic materials are determined not only by those of individual molecules but also by those of ensembles of molecules. This ability to control the building of nanoscopic and mesoscopic architectures represents a starting point for the construction of (supra) molecular electronic devices or even circuits (through surface patterning) with nanometer-sized semiconducting objects. The role of self-assembling processes in these systems is demonstrated here for thiophene-, phenylene-, phenylenevinylene-, and fluorene-based conjugated oligomer (and polymer) linear and branched systems [1].

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and {{implement}} on WMAP 5 yr data a model independent approach of foreground power spectrum estimation for multifrequency {{observations of the}} CMB experiments. Recently, a model independent approach of CMB power spectrum estimation was proposed by Saha et al. 2006. This methodology demonstrates that the CMB power spectrum can be reliably estimated solely from WMAP data without assuming any template models for the foreground components. In the current paper, we extend this work to estimate the galactic foreground power spectrum using the WMAP 5 yr maps following a self-contained analysis. We apply the model independent method in harmonic basis to estimate the foreground power spectrum and frequency dependence of combined foregrounds. We also study the behavior of synchrotron spectral index variation over {{different regions of the}} sky. We use the full sky Haslam map as an <b>external</b> <b>template</b> to increase the degrees of freedom, while computing the synchrotron spectral index over the frequency range from 408 MHz to 94 GHz.

40|$|A {{family of}} pseudopeptidic macrocycles {{containing}} non-natural amino acids have been synthesized. The macrocyclization reaction {{has been studied}} experimentally and computationally, demonstrating the key role of both the amino acid side chain and the catalytic bromide anion. The bromide anion acts as an <b>external</b> <b>template</b> assisting the folding of the open-chain precursor in a proper conformation. Computations revealed that {{in the presence of}} the anion, the effect of the side chain on the energy barrier for the macrocyclization is very small. However, the effect on the conformational equilibria of the open-chain precursors is very important. Overall, the stabilization of those conformation(s) in which the two reactive ends of the open-chain intermediate are located at short distances from each other with the correct orientation is the critical parameter defining the success of the macrocyclization. The best yield was found for the compound containing cyclohexylalanine, for which the computationally-predicted most stable conformer in the presence of Br- has a proper preorganization for cyclization. The remarkable agreement obtained between experiments and theory reveals that the computational approach here considered can be of great utility for the prediction of the behavior of other related systems and for the design of appropriate synthetic routes to new macrocyclic compounds. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|While the {{striking}} structures (e. g. nest architecture, trail networks) of insect societies may seem familiar {{to many of}} us, the understanding of pattern formation still constitutes a challenging problem. Over the last two decades, self-organization has dramatically changed our view on how collective decision-making and structures may emerge out of a population of ant workers having each their own individuality {{as well as a}} limited access to information. A variety of collective behaviour spontaneously outcome from multiple interactions between nestmates, even when there is no directing influence imposed by an <b>external</b> <b>template,</b> a pacemaker or a leader. By focussing this review on foraging structures, we show that ant societies display some properties which are usually considered in physico-chemical systems, as typical signatures of self-organization. We detail the key role played by feed-back loops, fluctuations, number of interacting units and sensitivity to environmental factors in the emergence of a structured collective behaviour. Nonetheless, going beyond simple analogies with non-living self-organized patterns, we stress on the specificities of social structures made of complex living units of which the biological features have been selected throughout the evolution depending on their adaptive value. In particular, we consider the ability of each ant individual to process information about environmental and social parameters, to accordingly tune its interactions with nestmates and ultimately to determine the final pattern emerging at the collective level. We emphasize on the parsimony and simplicity of behavioural rules at the individual level which allow an efficient processing of information, energy and matter within the whole colony. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments {{is based on}} the interpretation of multi-frequency sky maps in terms of different astrophysical components and it requires specifically tailored component separation algorithms. In this context, Internal Linear Combination (ILC) methods have been extensively used to extract the CMB emission from the WMAP multi-frequency data. We present here a Modified Internal Linear Component Algorithm (MILCA) that generalizes the ILC approach to the case of multiple astrophysical components for which the electromagnetic spectrum is known. In addition MILCA corrects for the intrinsic noise bias in the standard ILC approach and extends it to an hybrid space-frequency representation of the data. It also allows us to use <b>external</b> <b>templates</b> to minimize the contribution of extra components but still using only a linear combination of the input data.

We also show that, by in situ functionalizing the shell wall of SHNs, it is capable of entrapping nearly an eightfold quantity of vitamin Bc in comparison to the bare bulk silica nanospheres. These results confirm the feasibility of guest species entrapment in the functionalized shell wall, and SHNs are effective carriers of guest (bio-)molecules potentially for a variety of biomedical applications. By rationally choosing the functional (self-templating) molecules, this concept may represent a general strategy for the production of functionalized silica hollow structures.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to foreground removal for CMB maps. Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the foreground components, we first extract the necessary information about them directly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps at different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as internal templates, consist only of linear combinations of Galactic foregrounds and noise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground-cleaned maps by fitting these internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately scaled contributions of them from, the CMB-dominated channels. The fitting operation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high resolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the WMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the WMAP team at the signal-dominated scales. The fact that we obtain basically identical results without using any <b>external</b> <b>templates</b> has considerable relevance for future observations of the CMB polarization, where very {{little is known about the}} Galactic foregrounds. Finally, we have revisited previous claims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales and confirm that these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to foreground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution independently to the northern and southern hemisphere, indicating that the asymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of the hemispheres. This conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of any observed frequency dependence...|$|R

Chapter 2 presents a successful use of this approach to develop a synthetic receptor for nicotine.

Chapter 3 describes the design of a DCL of which nearly all of its macrocyclic, oligomeric members can be amplified, with size selectivity, after being exposed to 30 organic ammonium-ion templates.

Upon irradiation with UV light, thin SAC films undergo spatially localised increases {{of the index}} of refraction, a macroscopic property {{that has been used}} in the photo-lithography of passive integrated optics devices. Our spectroscopic studies indicate that UV initiated free-radical polymerisation of methacrylate substituents trigger further growth and densification of the silica host. This advances our molecular level understanding of photo-reactions in hybrid organo-silica networks. We examine laser-initiated organic chain growth in SAC planar waveguides. Optical modes initiate polymerisation of methacrylate substituents along the propagation path. In turn, the nascent reaction medium presents a non-uniform refractive index profile to the guided laser beam. Spatially localised and intensity-dependent refractive index changes create a lens-like profile in the medium. As a result, the beam self-focuses along its propagation axis without diffraction. We describe oriented organic chain growth in the nonlinear optical and highly anisotropic reaction field provided by a linearly polarised, self-focusing laser beam. A self-focusing laser beam induces an anisotropy in the refractive index profile of SAC waveguides. We characterise laser-induced birefringence in the hybrid network through polarised waveguide Raman spectroscopy and optical birefringence measurements.

40|$|Primordial non-Gaussianity {{of local}} type is {{predicted}} to lead to enhanced halo clustering on very large scales. Photometric quasars, which {{can be seen from}} cosmological redshifts z > 2 even in wide-shallow optical surveys, are promising tracers for constraining non-Gaussianity using this effect. However, large-scale systematics can also mimic this signature of non-Gaussianity. In order to assess the contribution of systematic effects, we cross-correlate overdensity maps of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR 6) in different redshift ranges. We find that the maps are significantly correlated on large scales, even though we expect the angular distributions of quasars at different redshifts to be uncorrelated. This implies that the quasar maps are contaminated with systematic errors. We investigate the use of <b>external</b> <b>templates</b> that provide information on the spatial dependence of potential systematic errors to reduce the level of spurious clustering in the quasar data. We find that templates associated with stellar density, the stellar color locus, airmass, and seeing are major contaminants of the quasar maps, with seeing having the largest effect. Using template projection, we are able to decrease the significance of the cross-correlation measurement on the largest scales from 9. 2 σ to 5. 4 σ. Although this is an improvement, the remaining cross-correlation suggests the contamination in this quasar sample is too great to allow a competitive constraint on f_NL by correlations internal to this sample. The SDSS quasar catalog exhibits spurious number density fluctuations of approximately 2 % rms, and we need a contamination level less than 1 % (0. 6 %) in order to measure values of f_NL less than 100 (10). Properly dealing with these systematics will be paramount for future large scale structure surveys that seek to constrain non-Gaussianity...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in metal nanoparticles has seen {{an exponential growth}} in the last twenty years, due to the astonishing properties these materials possess on the nanometer size scale. Compared to the bulk metal, nanoparticles present different optical and physical properties, which can be tuned according to their size or shape. As an example, colloidal solutions of 15 nm gold nanoparticles appear red, a very different tint as compare to the typical gold color of a gold brick. The reason for this variation {{is due to the}} fact that visible light wavelengths are bigger than the nanoparticles sizes. Therefore, after excitation, part of the light is absorbed and produces a coherent oscillation of the surface electrons, resulting in a phenomenon known as surface plasmon resonance. At this point the system tends to return to the initial state, following different pathways. One of the processes occurring is the local release of heat around the nanoparticle surface. The aim of this thesis is to gain more insight into the actual temperature values achievable after plasmon irradiation and to explore the possible applications of the localized heat release. Synthetic procedures developed in the Scaiano group were used to synthesize and modify the nanoparticles. The applicability of these photochemical procedures was extended to the synthesis of bimetallic silver-gold (Ag/Au) core-shell materials via a controlled and facile synthesis method. Ag/Au core-shells combine the optical and physical properties of gold and silver together and they have shown promise as potential antimicrobial agents. Information regarding the temperatures achievable after plasmon excitation has been obtained using dicumyl peroxide as a molecular thermometer and has indicated temperatures close to 500 oC near the nanoparticle surface. This finding was a precious guideline for the selection of thermal processes that can be performed after plasmon excitation. The catalytic reduction of resazurin to resorufin was one of the reactions chosen. This process, indeed, appears significantly faster (nanoseconds) when performed using AuNP irradiated at 530 nm. The use of laser and LED irradiations has been a constant throughout this work with both systems being to suite the experimental needs. The high temperature reached irradiating metal nanoparticles has also been used to trigger the caprolactam polymerization, in such a way that only in the light exposed position AgNP favored nylon formation, presenting promising applications in lithography. Moreover, DNA melting processes have been successfully studied, by employing a switch On/Off controllable irradiation of AuNP, aiming for eventual application in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. Finally, considerable work has been done in the functionalization and modification of carbon-based materials. Functionalization with silver and gold nanoparticles has been performed using a photochemical procedure, during which a different behavior was observed for the two metals. In addition, modification of the reduced graphene oxide morphology was obtained by laser irradiation without the use of any <b>external</b> <b>template.</b> The spherical reduced graphene oxide, thus obtained, has shown promising potential in water splitting catalysis. In this system, the evolution of hydrogen was observed by employing only spherical reduced graphene oxide and visible light (532 nm laser or LED irradiation).

Low-resolution spectroscopy (R≈ 1000) of 42 CoRoT targets covering a wide range in SNR (1 - 437) and of 149 templates was obtained in 2012 - 2013 with the Nasmyth spectrograph at the Tautenburg 2 m telescope. Spectral types have been derived automatically by comparing with the observed template spectra. The classification has been repeated with the external CFLIB library. The spectral class obtained with the external library agrees within a few sub-classes when the target spectrum has a SNR of about 100 at least. While the photometric spectral type can deviate by an entire spectral class, the photometric luminosity classification is as close as a spectroscopic classification with the external library. A low SNR of the target spectrum limits the attainable accuracy of classification more strongly than the use of <b>external</b> <b>templates</b> or photometry. Furthermore we found that low-resolution reconnaissance spectroscopy ensures that good planet candidates are kept that would otherwise be discarded based on photometric spectral type alone.

40|$|Abstract. Feature point {{tracking}} and detection of X-ray images is challenging due to overlapping anatomical structures of different depths, which lead tolow-contrast images. Tracking ofmotion in X-raysequences can support many clinical applications like motion compensation or 2 D / 3 D registration algorithms. This paper {{is the first}} to evaluate the performance of several feature {{tracking and}} detection algorithms on artificial and real X-ray image sequences, which involve rigid motion as well as external disturbances. A stand-alone application has been developed to provide an overall test bench for all algorithms, realized by OpenCV implementations. Experimentsshow thatthe Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker is the most consistent and effective tracking algorithm. Considering <b>external</b> disturbances, <b>template</b> matching provides the most sufficient results. Furthermore, the influence of feature point detection methods on tracking results is shown. ...|$|R

The objective is to raise brand equity and image through improving the external perception of EWBNZ, while maximising the impact that EWBNZ is able to make in relation to its mission, vision and values. Investigations into how EWBNZ has marketed itself in the past, as well as a stakeholder analysis, have resulted in the identification of key focus areas for the strategy. These focus areas include improving marketing knowledge within the EWBNZ community as well as reducing the time needed to produce <b>external</b> communications. <b>Templates,</b> guides and learning material have been provided to direct marketing personnel to the best approach for external communications for EWBNZ, these {{can be found on the}} EWBNZ shared drive and intranet...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of carbon peapods (encapsulated fullerenes in nanotubes) into doublewalled nanotubes was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The simulations reproduce {{the two main}} trends known experimentally: the production of low-defect nanotubes and the templating effect of the outer tube. The process involves a low-temperature polymerization of the fullerenes followed by higher temperature self-assembly into a tube. Modelling of this second stage is {{made possible by the}} use of the Environment-Dependent Interaction Potential, a large number of atoms and long-time annealing. Analysis shows that the outer tube acts as a container for the self-assembly process, analogous to previous simulations and experiments in which free surfaces, either <b>external</b> or internal, <b>template</b> the formation of highly ordered sp 2 phases...|$|R
30|$|Deformable {{templates}} {{are proposed}} {{to cope with}} the limitations of fixed template matching. A pioneering study in this direction was presented by Yuille et al. [72]. Accordingly, a deformable parametric template is made evolve by internal and <b>external</b> forces. The <b>template</b> is attracted to salient features such as peaks, valleys and edges in the intensity images. For example, eye and lip templates are first extracted via morphological filters and the energy function resulting from internal and external forces is minimized with a gradient descent algorithm [72]. In a recent study [73], Zhang and Ruan combined the fixed and deformable templates, such that first, fixed templates are used to locate a rectangular RoI around the face components, and then deformable templates are used to extract the contour of the component. Notice that template or transform techniques are often used in model-based algorithms as well as part of low-level image processing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Described herein is {{interfacial}} bioorthogonal cross-linking, {{the use of}} bioorthogonal chemistry {{to create}} and pattern biomaterials through diffusion-controlled gelation at the liquid-gel interface. The basis is a rapid (k 2 284000 M − 1 s− 1) reaction between strained trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) derivatives. Syringe delivery of Tz-function-alized hyaluronic acid (HA-Tz) to a bath of bis-TCO cross-linker instantly creates microspheres with a cross-linked shell through which bis-TCO diffuses freely to introduce further cross-linking at the interface. Tags can be introduced with 3 D resolution without <b>external</b> triggers or <b>templates.</b> Water-filled hydrogel channels were prepared by simply reversing the order of addition. Prostate cancer cells encapsulated in the microspheres have 99 % viability, proliferate readily, and form aggregated clusters. This process is projected to be useful in the fabrication of cell-instructive matrices for in vitro tissue models. The construction of cell-instructive hydrogel networksrepresents {{the first step toward}} in vitro engineering of functional tissues. 1, 2 For tissue engineering, it is essential tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether distinct self-propagating structures could be formed within the same amino acid sequence {{in the absence of}} <b>external</b> cofactors or <b>templates</b> has important implications for a number of issues, including the origin of prion strains and the engineering of smart, self-assembling peptide-based biomaterials. In the current study, we showed that chemically identical prion protein can give rise to conformationally distinct, self-propagating amyloid structures in the absence of cellular cofactors, post-translational modification, or PrPSc-specified templates. Even more surprising, two self-replicating states were produced under identical solvent conditions, but under different shaking modes. Individual prion conformations were inherited by daughter fibrils in seeding experiments conducted under alternative shaking modes, illustrating the high fidelity of fibrillation reactions. Our study showed that the ability to acquire conformationally different self-propagating structures is an intrinsic ability of protein fibrillation and strongly supports the hypothesis that conformational variation in self-propagating protein states underlies prion strain diversity...|$|R
40|$|Next Generation Sequencing Technology has {{revolutionized}} {{our ability}} to study the contribution of rare genetic variation to heritable traits. However, existing single-marker association tests are underpowered for detecting rare risk variants. A more powerful approach involves pooling methods that combine multiple rare variants from the same gene into a single test statistic. Proposed pooling methods can be limited because they generally assume high-quality genotypes derived from deep-coverage sequencing, {{which may not be}} available. In this paper, we consider an intuitive and computationally efficient pooling statistic, the cumulative minor-allele test (CMAT). We assess the performance of the CMAT and other pooling methods on datasets simulated with population genetic models to contain realistic levels of neutral variation. We consider study designs ranging from exon-only to whole-gene analyses that contain noncoding variants. For all study designs, the CMAT achieves power comparable to that of previously proposed methods. We then extend the CMAT to probabilistic genotypes and describe application to low-coverage sequencing and imputation data. We show that augmenting sequence data with imputed samples is a practical method for increasing the power of rare-variant studies. We also provide a method of controlling for confounding variables such as population stratification. Finally, we demonstrate that our method makes it possible to use <b>external</b> imputation <b>templates</b> to analyze rare variants imputed into existing GWAS datasets. As proof of principle, we performed a CMAT analysis of more than 8 million SNPs that we imputed into the GAIN psoriasis dataset by using haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{presentation}} at the Fourth European Conference on Education, June 2016. The International Academic Forum (IAFOR), Brighton, UKPsychology, anthropology and neuroscience are currently researching compassion - {{how it can be}} defined and understood, and how compassion can be applied into world and local social systems for building more co-operative and integrated societies. Disappointingly, it appears that so far, education has, on the whole, struggled to translate this research and scholarship into practical pedagogy for the university classroom. Models of 'excellence' that are based on individualistic competitiveness in higher education are largely to blame. This paper reports outcomes of a study that made student attention to compassion for fellow students in their university seminars/tutorials, credit-bearing towards degree programmes. Two departments of a British university participated: Humanities and Business. Subject tutors embedded training of students, in compassionate practice in their seminars/tutorials; these were run as small group discussions amongst students only, of their individual, independent subject reading. Student participants (n= 240) were local white, local black, local ethnic minority, and international; under and post graduates. Effects on social and learning experiences were explored through seven data collection tools, including film analysis, micro-ethnographic observations of seminar discussions (with and without the compassion-focussed pedagogy); and interviews and focus groups with students, teaching staff/assessors, and <b>external</b> examiners. <b>Template</b> analysis was used to identify themes from the data. On an ethnically diverse business module of (n= 38) students, a comparative statistical analysis of all individual, assessed, critical thinking performances was conducted. It showed no attainment gap for critical thinking between the BME/white local students. This study informs theory, practice and policy in Higher Education.

40|$|In view of {{increasing}} {{health care costs}} and budgetary problems, a systematic reimbursement decision process for medical technologies becomes an important instrument of allocation. Coverage decisions have monetary impact on patients and service providers, {{and at the same}} time they implicitly decide whether a technology is implemented and more evidence can be gained. In Austria an overall catalogue of outpatient medical care has been worked on and will need a consistent process for maintenance and further development. Within this context, international practice models of reimbursement processes and their features are analyzed so that critical success factors can be derived. Via hand search on websites and in databases, completed by a systematic literature search, application processes for reimbursement of medical interventions and associated literature has been identified. The criterion for including a country/process was the availability of English, German, or French templates/guidelines for <b>external</b> application. The <b>templates</b> were categorized according to the information domains of the EUnetHTA core model, the funding processes were analyzed regarding to phases and characteristics. The following processes have been analyzed: Australia (MSAC), Denmark (mini-HTA), Spain (GANT), Germany (G-BA, KBV innovation service), England (NICE single technology appraisal), France (HAS application form for medical procedures), Switzerland (BAG) and Austria (MEL, OÖGKK). From the 8 identified and specified country models, Germany, France and Switzerland, which are to some degree comparable to the Austrian health care system, and additionally the Austrian pharmaceutical funding process, have been analyzed according to the process phases (topic selection, assessment, appraisal, decision, implementation) and –aspects (structures, decision criteria, dealing with evidence, stakeholder involvement, communication of results, etc.) ...|$|R
