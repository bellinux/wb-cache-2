40|$|Thinning {{trials in}} {{secondary}} growth ash-maple stands {{carried out in}} the Agno-Chiampo district (VI) : results after second thinning. The second thinning results undertaken in four ash-maple stands of different age are described. In three stands a target tree management system (<b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> around few target trees) was applied. In the oldest stand one mixed thinning has been implemented. In the youngest stand 400 target trees have been preselected and numerically half reduced after a second <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> (aged 18 yr). The basal area of this stand decreased globally with 34 %. In the middle aged stand (aged 28 and 31 yr), all the target trees, previously selected, were favoured. Among them, only those seriously damaged (by logging and frost) were cut down. The overall uptake in this stand has been the 30 % of basal area. In the oldest stand the second traditional thinning (aged 37 yr) was more intensive, than the previous: the 34 % of basal area has been felled. The analysis of target trees diameter growth has revealed that <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> has been efficient for the youngest stand (a constant diameter increment of 8, 6 mm yr- 1). Conversely, a progressive reduction of diameter increment (5, 5 mm yr- 1) has been found in the control plot. The reaction to thinning in the middle aged stand was inferior in terms of homogeneity and diameter increment through years (6 mm yr- 1 average), this underline a less reaction of crowns. In the oldest stand, late thinnings had little incremental effect, however the general stability and specific diversity improved. The experimental results confirm the necessity to carry out the first thinning in young stands (aged 15 - 20 yr) with a frequency of 4 - 6 yr in a restricted number of target trees (100 - 200 per hectare). In the oldest stands the chance to improve the production of good quality timber is reduced, but timber with fairly good technological characteristics can be however obtained. </span...|$|E

30|$|The study {{presented}} the first optimizations for pine, spruce and birch mixtures in Finland. Most previous optimizations are for pure one-species stands (Valsta 1992; Hyytiäinen et al. 2004; Tahvonen 2011), {{and there are}} some studies for pine-spruce mixtures (Pukkala and Miina 1997; Pukkala et al. 1998; Vettenranta and Miina 1999). The latter studies suggest that pine and spruce mixtures are more productive than pure conifer stands. Optimizations for mixed stands also suggest that mixtures may be healthier than monocultures (Möykkynen and Pukkala 2010). They are also better than monocultures in terms of diversity and scenic value (Silvennoinen et al. 2001). Although yield was not maximized in the current study, the optimizations suggest that mixed stands may be more productive than pure spruce stands. When ingrowth was not included in simulation, the mixed spruce plantation produced 8.7 m 3 ha- 1 a- 1 whereas the most productive pure stand (<b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> at most 40 % of basal area) produced 7.8 m 3 ha- 1 a- 1. In the pine plantation, mixed stands were not more productive than a pure pine stand.|$|E
40|$|Thinning trees by {{form and}} defects (tree-class thinnings) and {{practical}} or <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> (according {{to the surrounding}} trees) were unsuitable for comparing thinning methods by the subjectivity of the involved tree classification methods. A thinning criterion based on 'top height' and 'stem number' proved objective. By assuming different ratios between crown diameter and height at a certain developmental stage of the trees, reduction in stem number could be obtained, related to the mean 'top height', which was height, measured and averaged on the 100 highest trees, uniformly distributed over 1 ha. Assuming different ratios gave different stem number reductions. Thus the results of different objective thinning grades could be compared. Initial stem number {{was determined by the}} ratio crown diameter: height and by the relation between spacing and amount of thinning. In spacing experiments the influence of spacing on stem form and the tree defects already yielded conclusions about stem number (not too low; higher on worse soil), mixed plantations and the way of planting (planting in rows was recommended). Conclusions on amount of thinning were not yet possible. The method was simple in practice, even for other tree species...|$|E

40|$|Relatively simple {{analytical}} {{procedures for the}} estimation of natural frequencies of <b>free</b> <b>thin</b> rectangular plates, based on the Rayleigh quotient and the Rayleigh-Ritz method, are presented. First, natural modes are assumed in the usual form as products of beam natural modes in the longitudinal and transverse directions, satisfying the grillage boundary conditions. Based on a detailed FEM analysis, the missing of some natural modes, defined as a sum and a difference of the cross products of beam modes, is noted. The frequencies of these modes are very similar and identical in some special cases, manifesting {{in such a way}} a double frequency phenomenon. These families of natural mode shapes form a complete natural frequency spectrum of a free rectangular plate as a novelty. The reliable approximation of natural modes enables the application of the Rayleigh quotient for the estimation of higher natural frequencies. The application of the developed procedure is illustrated by the case of a <b>free</b> <b>thin</b> square plate. The obtained results are compared with those determined by FEM and also with rigorous ones from the relevant literature based on the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The achieved accuracy is acceptable from the engineering point of view. Furthermore, the same problem is solved by the Rayleigh-Ritz method using approximate natural modes as mathematical ones. Direct and iterative procedures are presented. A small number of mathematical modes and iteration steps are sufficient to achieve reliable results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A test of {{group-selection}} and single-tree {{selection was}} installed in 80 -year-old even-aged oak-hickory stands in the Boston Mountains of northern Arkansas. Twenty-four 11 -acre plots were installed in well stocked stands representing north or east and south or west aspects. Stands between group openings were cut to residual basal areas of 65 and 85 ft 2 per acre using <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> or structural control. Tree quality in residual stands was evaluated using U. S. Forest Service tree grades for factory lumber and Grosenbaugh tree classes. Trees 11. 6 in. and larger in dbh were considered sawtimber and included in the analysis. The effects of density, cutting method, and aspect on tree grade were evaluated using 2, 225 sawtimber-sized trees. Results indicate no difference among treatments due to the short time interval since cutting. However, 53 percent of sawtimber either were or {{have the potential to}} develop into high quality trees. A residual basal area of 65 ft 2 or less is more likely to effectively increase tree quality and control species composition in the Boston Mountains than an 85 ft 2 target basal area. Overall, this study indicates that there is excellent potential to improve stand tree quality in the Boston Mountains of northern Arkansas using uneven-aged silviculture...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different silvicultural systems for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Netherlands in terms of timber production and wind stability over a full rotation. This was done using the forest genetics, ecology, management and wind model (ForGEM-W), which combines a distant dependent tree growth simulator with a mechanical¿empirical wind damage module. Six different silvicultural systems were evaluated: normal yield table management, <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> from above in a monospecies and a mixed stand (50 per cent mixture of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)), uneven-aged system, no thinning regime with low initial stand density of Douglas-fir with and without admixture of beech. Silvicultural systems leading to low height¿diameter (h/d) ratios were most successful in avoiding damage. Low h/d ratios were obtained in the system with low stand density and no thinning and in the uneven-aged system by systematically removing trees with the highest ratios during thinning. In particular, the uneven-aged system combined a high timber production with low risk. The use of Douglas-fir¿beech mixtures changed the competition pressure on Douglas-fir, and thus the h/d ratio and the wind risk. Results from this study indicate that the current trend towards more nature-oriented management could lead to lower wind risks and even to an increase in overall productivity...|$|E
40|$|In the West, {{thinning}} {{and partial}} cuttings are {{being considered for}} treating millions of forested acres that are overstocked and prone to wildfire. The objectives of these treatments include tree growth redistribution, tree species regulation, timber harvest, wildlife habitat improvement, and wildfire-hazard reduction. Depending on the forest type and its structure, thinning has {{both positive and negative}} impacts on crown fire potential. Crown bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height are primary stand characteristics that determine crown fire potential. Thinning from below, <b>free</b> <b>thinning,</b> and reserve tree shelterwoods have the greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown fire behavior. Selection thinning and crown thinning that maintain multiple crown layers, along with individual tree selection systems, will not reduce the risk of crown fires except in the driest ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests. Moreover, unless the surface fuels created by using these treatments are themselves treated, intense surface wildfire may result, likely negating positive effects of reducing crown fire potential. No single thinning approach can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} wildfires in the multiple forest types of the West. The best general approach for managing wildfire damage seems to be managing tree density and species composition with well-designed silvicultural systems at a landscape scale that includes a mix of thinning, surface fuel treatments, and prescribed fire with proactive treatment in areas with high risk to wildfire...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of a comparison of thinning in spruce forest stands and beech forest stands. The data were collected {{in the area of}} forest districts Oravská Polhora and Nadleśnictwa Jeleśnia. The aim was to find out the intensity and the type of thinning. There were particular selected stands with similar natural and characteristic conditions where a future intervention was planned. There were established 8 research plots in the stands with the area of 0, 16 ha. Basic stand characteristics were measured and evaluated on the plots before and also after the interventions. The data analyzing shows a big difference among the intensities of interventions. The thinning in Poland was much more intense. The intensity of thinning on the plots of Slovak territory was just one half of the intensity prescribed in the forest economical plans. There was a big difference between the measured stand reserves and the reserves listed in the plans. On the plots where beech was the dominant tree species a thinning from above with negative selection was done. On the plots where spruce was the dominant tree species a negative thinning from below with minimal intervention into the level was done. This corresponds with the indexes of thinning. The carried out ways of thinning for beech and spruce were often used especially in the past. Current effort is to grow stands with the highest stability and quality. According to these requirements newer and more modern ways of thinning were developed. These ways help us effective to achieve the aims. Based on the results a rationalization thinning from above according to Korpeľ (1988), possibly <b>free</b> <b>thinning</b> from above according to Štefančík (1984) was suggested in the stands with beech as a dominant tree species.
