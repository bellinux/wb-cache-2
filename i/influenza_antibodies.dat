50|$|During the 1918 flu pandemic, an {{estimated}} 20% of the world’s population became infected and 50 million of those infections {{proved to be}} fatal. In the United States, the average lifespan dropped by 12 years per person. The disease struck indiscriminately by class but was often fatal for those that were in their 20s and 30s while having a particularly strong effect on pregnant women, infecting one third of all American women that were pregnant between 1918 and 1919. Children who were born in 1919 and had mothers who were infected during gestation experienced many handicaps later in life. Those born in 1919 experienced a 5% or more wage drop and were often found to have lower educational achievement overall. These children were also 20% {{more likely to be}} disabled than other comparable cohorts (early 1918 and late 1919) who did not experience in utero exposure. In a study conducted in 2008 it was found that in utero exposure to the pandemic led to higher chances of developing coronary heart disease and kidney disease later in life. The study concluded an 11.8% increased chance of coronary heart disease for those born {{in the first quarter of}} 1919. and a 51% increased chance of developing kidney disease for those born in the fourth quarter in 1918 as compared to those born in early 1918 and late 1919. It is also notable that those who were already born but young (between the ages of 1 and 5) during exposure did not have a noticeable increase in coronary heart disease or kidney disease. In Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, there was a drop in educational attainment for those in utero during exposure to the pandemic. Being exposed to the pandemic while in utero would lead to an average loss of 0.3-0.4 years of schooling. These effects were much higher or lower depending on the district of Italy. The possibility that maternal exposure to influenza during gestation may be linked to increased rates of schizophrenia later in life for the child. In a recent study conducted in California they were able to predict schizophrenia in adult offspring by analyzing the <b>influenza</b> <b>antibodies</b> of pregnant women in 1959-1966.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The 2009 swine-origin {{influenza}} virus (S-OIV) H 1 N 1 pandemic has caused more than 18, 000 deaths worldwide. Vaccines against the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 {{influenza virus}} {{are useful for}} preventing infection and controlling the pandemic. The kinetics of the immune response following vaccination with the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine need further investigation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 58 volunteers were vaccinated with a 2009 A/H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza monovalent split-virus vaccine (15 µg, single-dose). The sera were collected before Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on Days 3, 5, 10, 14, 21, 30, 45 and 60 post vaccination. Specific antibody responses induced by the vaccination were analyzed using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After administration of the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine, specific and protective antibody response with a major subtype of IgG was sufficiently developed as early as Day 10 (seroprotection rate: 93 %). This specific antibody response could maintain for at least 60 days without significant reduction. Antibody response induced by the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine could not render protection against seasonal H 1 N 1 influenza (seroconversion rate: 3 % on Day 21). However, volunteers with higher pre-existing seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> levels (pre-vaccination HI titer ≥ 1 ∶ 40, Group 1) more easily developed a strong antibody protection effect against the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza vaccine as compared with those showing lower pre-existing seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> levels (pre-vaccination HI titer < 1 ∶ 40, Group 2). The titer of the specific antibody against the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza was much higher in Group 1 (geometric mean titer: 146 on Day 21) than that in Group 2 (geometric mean titer: 70 on Day 21). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Recipients could gain sufficient protection as early as 10 days after vaccine administration. The protection could last at least 60 days. Individuals with a stronger pre-existing seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> response may have a relatively higher potential for developing a stronger humoral immune response after vaccination with the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza vaccine...|$|R

Given {{the importance of the}} village chickens as a source of income for rural families and its public health concern due to the frequent contact that exist between these birds and humans a study was conducted to assess the presence of antibodies to the H 5 avian influenza virus subtype in village chickens in some Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kaduna State. Materials and Methods: A total of 480 sera samples were obtained from apparently healthy local chickens in five LGAs where the avian influenza outbreak has not been reported. The sera were subjected to the Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using the H 5 N 2 avian influenza antigen. Results: An overall prevalence of 2. 9 % with an individual seroprevalence of 10 %, 0. 8 %, 4. 1 % and 3. 3 % in Jaba, Jemma'a, Kaura and Zango Kataf local government areas respectively. There was no association between presence of pigs and detection of avian <b>influenza</b> <b>antibodies,</b> p= 0. 8723, OR 0. 9153 (95 % CI: 0. 3108 &# 150; 2. 695), but there was an association between presence of water birds (Gesse and Ducks) and detection of avian <b>influenza</b> <b>antibodies,</b> p= 0. 0203, OR 3. 488 (95 % CI: 1. 146 &# 150; 10. 61).

40|$|Background Swine {{influenza}} virus (SIV) was first {{isolated in the}} United States in 1930 and was thereafter widely reported in many countries. Most SIVs that have been identified are influenza A viruses. There was no report of influenza B viruses isolated in swine. Seroepidemiological study in UK has shown a low seroprevalence of <b>influenza</b> B <b>antibody</b> in pigs. The primary serological test used to detect <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> is the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are also available commercially for detection of <b>antibodies</b> against <b>influenza</b> A viruses {{but not for the}} detection of <b>influenza</b> B <b>antibodies.</b> Objectives 1) To examine the prevalence of <b>influenza</b> B <b>antibodies</b> in pig sera sampled at the abattoir in Hong Kong. 2) To develop the cell-based ELISA assay for the detection of <b>antibodies</b> against <b>influenza</b> A and B viruses. 3) To compare the cell-based ELISA assays with three commercial ELISA kits, namely the IDVet ID Screen <b>influenza</b> A <b>antibody</b> competition ELISA, the IDEXX Influenza A Ab test and the IDEXX AI MultiS-Screen Ab test using swine sera. 4) To test swine sera using the influenza B cell-based ELISA assay to complement data on swine seroprevalence obtained with HI tests. Methods The first part of this study involved HI screening of 4643 pig sera from 2009 to 2012. These sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against B/Brisbane/ 60 / 2008 and B/Wisconsin/ 1 / 2010 whichrepresent the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages respectively. The second part of this study involved the development and performance evaluation of the cell-based ELISA assays. The cell-based ELISA assays were developed using {{influenza virus}} infected cells as the capture antigens and fluorescence-labelled anti-IgG antibody as the detection antibody. The viruses that were used to prepare the assays were A/California/ 04 / 2009, B/Brisbane/ 60 / 2008 and B/Wisconsin/ 1 / 2010. All three cell-based ELISA assays were tested with WHO reference sera and swine sera and the results were analyzed using paired t-test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. In addition, the results of the influenza A cell-based ELISA assay were compared with the commercial ELISA assay using Fisher’s exact two-tailed test, Pearson’s correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plot. Results A low prevalence (0. 28 %; 95 %CI: 0. 16 %- 0. 47 %) of <b>influenza</b> B <b>antibody</b> was observed inthe swine sera samples. The seroprevalence for B/Victoria was higher than that of B/Yamagatain 2010 to 2012. Co-existence of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata antibodies were found in the swine population during 2010 and 2011. The influenza A cell-based ELISA was found to have low sensitivity (64. 1 %; 95 %CI: 52. 4 %- 74. 4 %) and high specificity (94. 7 %; 95 %CI: 80. 9 %- 99. 1 %) when compared with the commercial ELISA assays. In contrast, using HI as the reference test influenza B cell-based ELISA prepared using B/Wisconsin/ 1 / 2010 infected cells were shown to have high sensitivity (92. 31 %; 95 %CI: 64. 0 %- 99. 8 %) but low specificity (63. 16 %; 95 %CI: 38. 4 %- 83. 7 %) in detection of <b>influenza</b> B <b>antibodies</b> in swine sera. Conclusion Sporadic transmission of influenza B virus may occur in swine but there is no evidence for efficient and sustained transmission of the virus between them. Cell-based ELISA assay prepared with B/Wisconsin/ 1 / 2010 may be considered as an alternative screening testprior to HI subtyping. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{diagnosis}} of Equine Influenza (EI) {{is critical to}} the implementation of control measures. In this study, two rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits and three ELISA kits were evaluated as diagnostic aids in the detection of EI. The Directigen Flu A, Espline Influenza A&B-N and the ID Screen Influenza A Antigen Capture ELISA were compared to the traditional ‘gold standard’ diagnostic tests, virus isolation (VI) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 75 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from horses on premises where natural outbreaks had occurred, and a total of 104 swabs were collected from experimentally challenged foals and tested by all five methods. RT-PCR was the most sensitive diagnostic technique. Directigen Flu A was the most sensitive kit in both sample groups detecting 46. 95 % positive in comparison to 16. 18 % (Espline Influenza A&B-N) and 16. 96 % (ID Screen Influenza A Antigen Capture ELISA). The superiority of Directigen Flu A was confirmed by comparing the limit of sensitivity of the three assays using known concentrations of virus. Post challenge, Directigen Flu A detected positives at the time of peak virus shedding but was less effective when horses were excreting low levels of virus. Thus Directigen Flu A test is a useful screening technique but negative samples from suspect cases should be submitted to a laboratory for testing by RT-PCR. The ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA which detects antibodies against the viral nucleoprotein (NP) was compared to the single radial haemolysis (SRH) test and the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Paired samples from 203 horses on 14 infected premises were tested. Fewer seroconversions were detected by ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA (25 %) than by SRH (43 %) or HI (41 %). The acute samples from the majority of affected horses that were not detected by ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA were seropositive. Post challenge in seronegative foals, the ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA detected a rise in antibodies earlier than the SRH test suggesting that in naїve populations this ELISA could provide a faster diagnosis than traditional serology methods. Sera collected from 60 weanlings following primary vaccination with five different vaccines (two whole inactivated vaccines, two ISCOM based subunit vaccines and a canary pox recombinant vaccine) were tested by ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA and SRH. The ELISA did not detect the antibody response to vaccination with the canary pox recombinant vaccine (Proteq Flu Te), confirming the usefulness of the combination of this kit and vaccine to differentiate between naturally infected and vaccinated horses i. e.

The pattern of antibody response post vaccination detected with the ID Screen <b>Influenza</b> A <b>Antibody</b> Competition ELISA was similar to that detected by the SRH test for the other four vaccines.

RESULTS: Using our assay, sera from patients who had recovered from infection with influenza H 5 N 1, and sera from animals experimentally immunized or infected with H 5 tested positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to H 5 N 1. Pseudotype neutralizing antibody titers were compared with titers obtained by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays and microneutralization (MN) assays using live virus, and showed a high degree of correlation, sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The pseudotype neutralization assay is as sensitive as horse erythrocyte HI and MN for the detection of antibodies to H 5 N 1. It is safer, and can be applied in a high-throughput format for human and animal surveillance and for the evaluation of vaccine...|$|E
40|$|The pseudotype {{particle}} {{neutralization test}} (pp-NT) is a next-generation serological assay employed for the sensitive study of <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> responses against hemagglutinin (HA), including stalk-directed antibodies. However, a validation of this assay {{has yet to}} be performed, and this limits its use to primarily research laboratories. To identify possible serological standards to be used in optimization and validation of the pp-NT, we have evaluated the cross-reactivity of hyperimmune chicken reference antisera in this assay. Our findings show that the cross-reactivity detected by the pp-NT is only partly explained by phylogenetic relationships and protein homology between the HA subtypes analysed; further studies are necessary to understand the origin of the cross-reactivity detected, and reference standards with higher specificity should be evaluated or generated de novo for future use in pp-NT...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{antibodies to}} polysaccharide antigens of pathogens commonly isolated from HIV- 1 -infected subjects were analyzed in serially collected sera of {{children born to}} seropositive mothers. Purified polysaccharides from type 14 Streptococcus pneumoniae, group C Neisseria meningitidis, type b Haemophilus influenzae, glucomannoprotein from Candida albicans and diphtheria toxoid antigens were used in an ELISA test to assess antibody levels. A significant rise of anti-pneumococcus antibody titres was noticed both in HIV- 1 -infected and in non-HIV- 1 -infected children aged 18 months or more. Anti-C. albicans and anti-group C N. meningitidis antibodies were elevated only in HIV- 1 -infected children older than 12 months. Anti-type b H. <b>influenzae</b> <b>antibodies</b> remained at low titres in both groups. Anti-diphtheria toxoid antibodies, analyzed {{as a model of}} humoral response to a protein antigen, were similar in both groups of HIV- 1 -infected and noninfected children...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the prevalence of}} haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to four strains of influenza viruses among handlers of live pigs in Ibadan, Nigeria. Venous blood specimens were collected from thirty pig handlers (out {{of a total of}} forty-eight) at three locations in Ibadan in April and May 2008. The overall prevalence of antibodies to influenza viruses was 100 %, while those of influenza A and B viruses were 68. 3 % and 58. 3 %, respectively. The prevalence of influenza A/Brisbane/ 59 / 2007 (H 1 N 1), A/Brisbane/ 10 / 2007 (H 3 N 2), B/Shanghai/ 361 / 2002 -like and B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004 -like was 46. 7 %, 90. 0 %, 76. 7 % and 40. 0 %, respectively. A total of 96. 7 % (n = 30) of pig handlers tested had polytypic influenza antibody reactions. This is the first report to document the prevalence of <b>influenza</b> <b>antibodies</b> among pig handlers in Nigeria and shows that humans who have regular and direct contact with live pigs in Ibadan are exposed to different strains of influenza viruses...|$|E

40|$|Influenza is {{a common}} {{infection}} among travelers, and attack rates are well documented in short-term travelers and holiday makers. Little data exists on long-term, non-expatriate travelers. This was a prospective mono-centre study of immunocompetent, Dutch travelers aged ≥ 18 to 64 years. It was conducted at the Public Health Service travel clinic in Amsterdam from December 2008 to September 2011, and included all travelers intending to travel to a tropical or sub-tropical country. Among 602 Dutch long-term travelers to tropical regions, 82 % had protective <b>influenza</b> <b>antibody</b> titres pre-travel. The influenza attack rate of serologically confirmed infection during travel was 15 %, and of symptomatic infection was 6. 3 % (fever alone) and 2 % (ILI), respectively. The attack rate {{in this study is}} similar to seasonal rates of infection in the general population. Influenza vaccination pre-travel is therefore most important for people at risk of medical complications due to influenz...|$|R
