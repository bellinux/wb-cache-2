40|$|Abstract: The present {{work was}} {{conducted}} to study the effect of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) spices or their essential oils on the nutritional parameters of rats suffering from hypercholesterolemic. Fifty-four male rats weighting approximately 300 grams were divided into nine groups, each group containing six rats. Group H 1 fed on basal diet as a control negative group. Group H 2 fed on diets containing 15 % of beef tallow instead of the fresh sunflower oil proportion and allowed added 1 % of H 2 O 2 in the drinking water to increase the oxidative stress and the other groups H 4, H 5, H 6, H 7, H 8 and H 9 fed on the same diet used in group H 2 and supplemented with different treatments nutmeg, rosemary and mixture powders groups H 4, H 5, H 6 (2 g / 100 g diet), respectively. Meanwhile, groups H 7, H 8 and H 9 fed on the same diet used in group H 2 and supplemented with different treatments nutmeg, rosemary and mixture essential oils (0. 6 gm / 100 <b>gm</b> <b>fat),</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract Apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV is {{synthesized}} in {{the small}} intestine during fat absorption and is incorporated {{onto the surface of}} nascent chylomicrons. In circulation, apoA-IV is displaced from the chylomicron surface by high density lipoprotein-associated C and E apolipoproteins; this exchange is critical for activation of lipoprotein lipase and chylomicron remnant clearance. The variant allele A-IV- 2 encodes a Q 360 H polymorphism that increases the lipid affinity of the apoA-IV- 2 isoprotein. We hypothesized that this would impede the transfer of C and E apolipoproteins to chylomicrons, and thereby delay the clearance of postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We therefore measured triglycerides in plasma, Sf � 400 chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in 14 subjects heterozygous for the A-IV- 2 allele (1 / 2) and 14 subjects homozygous for the common allele (1 / 1) who were fed a standard meal containing 50 <b>gm</b> <b>fat</b> per m 2 body surface area. All subjects had the apoE- 3 / 3 genotype. Postprandial triglyceride concentrations in the 1 / 2 subjects were significantly higher between 2 – 5 h in plasma, chylomicrons, and VLDL, and peaked at 3 h versus 2 h for the 1 / 1 subjects. The area under the triglyceride time curves was greater in the 1 / 2 subjects (plasma, P � 0. 045; chylomicrons, P � 0. 027; VLDL, P � 0. 063). A posthoc analysis of the frequency of the apoA-IV T 347 S polymorphism suggested that it had an effect on triglyceride clearance antagonistic to that of the A-IV- 2 allele. We conclude that individuals heterozygous for the A-IV- 2 allele display delayed postprandial clearance of triglyceride-ric...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} allometric development of intramuscular (imf), subcutaneous, and intramuscular fat in Australian Angus heifers and steers a. Steers (90) heifers (75) were fed a grain based ration and randomly allocated to a slaughter {{weight in the}} range 200 kg to 450 kg carcass weight Body composition was estimated from a 6 rib dissection (5 - 10) and imf content was estimated on of m. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL). Analysis of the results using general linear modelling (SAS) showed that at any given level of estimated total body fatness, steers had a significantly higher level of intramuscular fat (P 0. 05). There was a significantly linear increase (P < 0. 0001) in imf of the LTL as proportion of total rib fat. As carcass weight increased {{there was a significant}} increase in the ratio of <b>gms</b> <b>fat</b> in the LTL/gms of total body fat (P< 0. 0001), although the r 2 was low (r 2 = 0. 121), indicating that intramuscular fat tended to develop more strongly as the carcass weight increased. It can be concluded that steers are more efficient than heifers with respect to accumulation of imf, as they have a higher level of imf at the same total carcass fatness. In addition intramuscular fat accumulation occurred primarily in parallel with total body fat synthesis...|$|R
40|$|ITTLE ATTENTION {{has been}} paid to the {{observation}} of Longimui and Johnsontm that an alimentary lipemia may be responsible for increased fragility of erythrocytes. The possibility that the hemolysis may also occur in vivo is suggested by Loewy, et al., 2 who demonstrated that the output of bile pigment increased in dogs receiving high fat diets. More recently, Creditor 3 has observed that hemolysis due to shaking whole blood imucreased after intra-venous injection of two different fat emulsions. Our interest in this phenomenon aroused when it was observed that after shaking whole blood in a mechanical shaker to facilitate the solution of high molecular weight dextrans, the blood plasma of normal human subjects usually contained some free hemoglobin whereas the plasma of patiemits with multiple sclerosis contained none. Further investigation indicated that the degree of hemolysis in the blood of both patients and normal subjects paralleled the degree of the lipemia. The blood specimens were drawn three hours aft-er having given the subject a breakfast containing 15 <b>Gm.</b> of <b>fat.</b> The patients, most of whom wer...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of acetate}} as an {{intermediate}} metabolite {{has been the subject}} of considerable study (1). Its importance as a common pathway in the me-tabolism of carbohydrate, protein and fat has been established, and it has been implicated in the syn-thesis of cholesterol (2), porphyrins (3), fatty acids (4) and indirectly glucose (5). Acetate is rapidly metabolized and its measure-ment is a difficult procedure. Information con-cerning its behaviour has been derived from ex-periments involving the acetylation of the aromatic amines para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and sulf-anilamide. This reaction has been shown by Lip-mann to require, in addition to available acetate, coenzyme A (6), which contains pantothenic acid, and adenosine triphosphate (7). Although there have been many in vivo and in vitro studies in animals there are few reports of studies of this re-action in human subjects. In this study we have used the acetylation of PABA and sulfadiazine in normal individuals and in persons with metabolic disorders as a means of investigating acetate me-tabolism in human subjects. PROCEDURE The subjects were normal males and females, including several patients convalescing from mild infections; pa-tients with cirrhosis of the liver, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, leukemia, sprue, diabetes mellitus, rheu-matoid arthritis, and adrenal insufficiency. The hospital patients were maintained on the regular hospital diet which consisted of approximately 250 - 300 gms. of carbo-hydrate, 70 gms. of protein, 85 <b>gms.</b> of <b>fat,</b> supplying about 2, 300 Calories a day. Clinic patients were allowed to eat their usual diets. Patients with diabetes mellitus were attending the outpatient clinic and continued on their diabetic diets.

40|$|The larva of the weevil Rynchophorus ferrugineus is {{popularly known}} as sago worm. The sago worms were {{purchased}} from the wet market in Kuching, Sarawak. The fat tissues were dissected separately from the viscera and the cuticle. The neutral lipid content of the fat tissue was extracted with 150 ml of dichloromethane by using a Soxhlet apparatus. The neutral lipid content per <b>gm</b> <b>fat</b> tissue (fresh weight) from the viscera {{was found to be}} 59. 8 % whereas that from the cuticle was 11. 7 %. The profile of triacylglycerols was analyzed by using high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 501 HPLC pump) equipped with evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD, VAREX MKIII). The HPLC column used was Supelcosil LC- 18 column and the solvent system was acetonitrile /dichloromethane (68 : 32,v/v). The identification of triacylglycerols was carried out using purified olive and linseed oils and commercially available lipid standards. From the HPLC-ELSD chromatograms, two (2) major triacylglycerols, namely triolein (OOO) and l-palmitoyl- 2 - oleoyl- 3 -oleoyl-rac-glycerol (POO) and at least ten (10) other minor triacylglycerols were identified. The percentage (w/w) of triolein (OOO) in neutral lipid of the fat tissues from both viscera and cuticle was found to be 50 % whereas that of l-palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl- 3 -oleoyl-racglycerol (POO) was 41. 7 %. Other minor triacylglycerols identified in the neutral lipid of fat tissue from viscera were l-palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl- 3 -linolenoyl-rac-glycerol, POLn (0. 6 %), 1 - palmitoyl- 2 -linoleoyl- 3 -linoleoyl-rac-glycerol, PLL (0. 1 %), l-palmitoyl- 2 -palmitoyl- 3 - linoleoyl-rac-glycerol, PPL(1. 1 %) and l-palmitoyl- 2 -stearoyl- 3 -linoleoyl-rac-glycerol, PSO (2. 9 %) whereas that of cuticle were POLn (0. 2 %), PLL (1. 0 %), PPL(1. 1 %) and PSO (2. 9 %) ...|$|E

As a rich source of MUFA, pecans should represent a non-hyperlipidemic fat addition in isocaloric diets of equivalent SFA content. In this study hypercholesterolemic (mean ? SD serum total cholesterol, 5. 76 ? 0. 85 mmol/L) men and women with a pre-entry fat intake similar to an AHA Step I diet (32 % fat, 10 % SFA, 9. 6 % MUFA, 5. 6 % PUFA and 237 mg CHOL per day) participated in an 8 week, randomized, controlled feeding trial. Forty subjects (26 women, 14 men; mean age 55 y, range 22 - 71) were fed one of two diets: an AHA Step I diet (31 % fat: 9. 9 % SFA, 9. 2 % MUFA, 5. 5 % PUFA and 225 mg CHOL) or an isocaloric but higher fat percent pecan-based diet (40 % fat: 8. 4 % SFA, 17 % MUFA, 9. 9 % PUFA and 203 mg CHOL). There {{was no significant difference in}} SFA intake between either treatment group; MUFA intake increased by 17. 4 gm, from 19. 8 to 37. 2 gm per day, and PUFA intake increased 9. 74 gm, from 11. 5 to 21. 2 gm per day. Dietary compliance was excellent as judged by changes in proportions of n- 9 to n- 7 fatty acids within individual plasma lipid classes. Serum lipids, density fractionated lipoproteins, apolipoproteins (Apo B 100, Apo AI, Lp(a)), and acute phase proteins (CRP, SAA) were analyzed on all subjects at the end of the initial run-in period and at the end of the diet period by repeated measures analysis of variance (SAS, ProcGLM) with significance set at p 0. 2). As a rich nutrient source, pecans significantly increased dietary fiber, beta-carotene, thiamin, magnesium, copper, and manganese, normalizing inadequate magnesium and copper intake. Results of this study indicate that altering the Step I diet to include 20 % of daily energy intake as whole pecans can be as effective as the Step I diet in maintaining plasma lipids...|$|E
40|$|The main objetive of this Doctoral Thesis was {{to study}} the {{influence}} of female castration and pig sex on growth performance and carcass and meat quality of white pigs slaughtered at different final weights. Three experiments (Exp.) were conducted. In Exp. 1, a total of 200 (Landrace * Large White dam x Pietrain * Large White sire) gilts of 50 ± 3 days of age (23. 3 ± 1. 47 kg BW) was used to investigate the effects of castration (intact females, IF vs. castrated feamles, CF) and slaughter weight (106 vs. 122 kg BW) on productive performance and carcass and meat quality. There were four experimental treatments arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial and 5 replicates of 10 pigs each per treatment. Half of the gilts were ovariectomized at 58 d of age (8 days after {{the beginning of the}} trial; 29. 8 ± 1. 64 kg BW) whereas the other half remained intact. Meat samples were taken at m. Longissimus thoracis {{at the level of the}} last rib and subcutaneous fat samples were taken at the tail insertion. For the entire experiment period, CF had higher BW gain (P< 0. 05) and backfat and m. Gluteus medius (<b>GM)</b> <b>fat</b> thickness (P< 0. 001) than IF. However, IF had higher loin and trimmed primal cut yields (P< 0. 05) than CF. Meat quality was similar for IF and CF but the proportion of linoleic acid in subcutaneous fat was higher (P< 0. 001) for IF. Pigs slaughtered at 122 kg BW had higher (P< 0. 001) feed intake and poorer feed efficiency than pigs slaughtered at 106 kg BW. An increase in slaughter weight (SW) improved (P< 0. 001) carcass yield but decreased (P< 0. 05) trimmed primal cut yield. Meat from females slaughtered at the heavier BW was redder (a*; P< 0. 001) and had more (P< 0. 01) intramuscular fat and less thawing (P< 0. 05) and cooking (P< 0. 10) loss than meat from females slaughtered at the lighter BW. Also, females slaughtered at 122 kg BW had less (P< 0. 01) linoleic acid content in the subcutaneous fat than pigs slaughtered at 106 kg BW. Castration of gilts and slaughtering at heavier BW might be useful practices for the production of heavy pigs destined to the dry cured industry in which a certain amount of fat in the carcass is required. In contrast, when the carcasses are destined to fresh meat production, IF slaughtered at 106 kg BW are a more efficient alternative. In Exp. 2, crossbred pigs (n= 240) from Pietrain*Large White sires mated to Landrace*Large White dams with an average of 100 d of age (60. 5 ± 2. 3 kg) were used to investigate the effects of gender and slaughter weight (SW) on growth performance and carcass and meat quality characteristics. There were 6 treatments arranged factorially with 3 genders (IF vs. CF vs. castrated males, CM) and 2 SW (114 vs. 122 kg BW). Each of the 6 combinations of treatments was replicated 4 times and the experimental unit was a pen with 10 pigs. Castrated males and CF ate more feed, grew faster and had more carcass backfat depth and fat thickness at the GM muscle, but lower loin yield than IF (P< 0. 05). In addition, CF and CM had more intramuscular fat (P< 0. 05) and less linoleic acid content in the subcutaneous fat (P< 0. 01) than IF. Pigs slaughtered at 122 kg BW had lower ADG (P< 0. 05), poor gain-to-feed ratio (P< 0. 05), and more <b>GM</b> <b>fat</b> than pigs slaughtered at 114 kg BW (P < 0. 05). It is concluded that CF and CM had similar productive performance and meat quality characteristics when slaughtered at the same age, and that the castration of females improved daily gains and increased weight and fat content of primal cuts with respect to IF. Therefore, castration of females is recommended in pigs destined to the dry-cured industry because of the beneficial effects on the quality of the primal cuts. In Exp. 3, the effects of gender and castration of females (IF vs. CF vs. CM) on performance and carcass and meat quality were studied in crossbred pigs (Landrace x Large White dams x Duroc sires) slaughtered at 119. 2 (trial 1) or 131. 6 (trial 2) kg BW. Intact females had better feed conversion and less carcass fat than CF and CM. Trimmed shoulder yield was higher for CM than for CF with IF being intermediate. Primal cut yield and meat quality, however were similar for all treatments. Proportion of linoleic acid in backfat was lower for CF than for IF or CM, and the differences were significant in pigs slaughtered witn 131. 6 kg BW. The higher fat content and the fatty acid profile favour the use of CF and CM over IF for the production of heavy pigs destined to the dry-cured industry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMultiparous Holstein cows (n= 82) {{of either}} {{high or low}} genetic merit (<b>GM)</b> (for milk <b>fat</b> + protein yield) were {{allocated}} to 1 of 2 diets in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Diets differed in the ratio of rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) to rumen-degradable protein (37 % RUP vs. 15 % RUP) and were fed from 21 d precalving to 150 days in milk. This study evaluated {{the effects of these}} diets and GM on concentrations of milk casein (CN) variants and aimed to identify precalving and early lactation variables that predict milk CN and protein yield and composition and fertility of dairy cows. It explored the hypothesis that low milk protein content is associated with lower fertility and extended this hypothesis to also evaluate the association of CN contents with fertility. Yields (kg/d) for CN variants were 0. 49 and 0. 45 of α-CN, 0. 38 and 0. 34 of β-CN, 0. 07 and 0. 06 for κ-CN, and 0. 10 and 0. 09 of γ-CN for high- and low-RUP diets, respectively. Increased RUP increased milk, CN, and milk protein yields. Increased GM increased milk protein and γ-CN yields and tended to increase milk CN yield. The effects of indicator variables on CN variant yields and concentrations were largely consistent, with higher body weight and α-amino nitrogen resulting in higher yields, but lower concentrations. An increase in cholesterol was associated with decreased CN variant concentrations, and disease lowered CN variant yield. A diet high in RUP increased proportion of first services that resulted in pregnancy from 41 to 58 %. Increased precalving metabolizable protein (MP) balance decreased the proportion of first services that resulted in pregnancy when evaluated in a model containing CN percentage, milk protein yield, diet, and GM. This finding suggests that the positive effects of increasing dietary RUP on fertility may be curvilinear because cows with a very positive MP balance before calving were less fertile than those with a lower, but positive, MP balance. Prepartum MP balance was important to production and reproductive outcomes, but surprisingly, metabolizable energy balance was not. The hazard of pregnancy in the first 150 d of lactation was 28 % lower in cows producing milk with the lowest quartile of protein percentage compared with cows with milk in the upper 3 quartiles. Milk CN percentage was positively associated with improved pregnancy at first service. This study demonstrates the importance of protein metabolism to reproductive performance of the dairy cow...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{and genetic}} {{strategies}} {{are needed to}} enhance intramuscular fat (IMF) and MUFA content without altering carcass leanness. Dietary vitamin A restriction has been suggested to specifically promote IMF, whereas a polymorphism of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene has shown to specifically increase MUFA. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the combined effects of provitamin A (PVA) carotenoid intake and SCD genotype (AY 487830 :g. 2228 T>C) on hepatic retinoid content and on the liver, muscle (LM and gluteus medius [GM]), and subcutaneous fat (SF) content and fatty acid composition. Following a split-plot design, 32 castrated Duroc pigs, half of each of the 2 homozygous SCD genotypes (CC and TT), were subjected from 165 to 195 d of age to 2 finishing diets differing in the PVA carotenoid content (an enriched-carotene diet [C+] and a control diet [C-]). Both diets were identical except for the corn line used in the feed. The C+ was formulated with 20 % of a carotenoid-fortified corn (M 37 W-Ph 3) whereas the C- instead used 20 % of its near isogenic M 37 W line, which did not contain PVA carotenoids. No vitamin A was added to the diets. The C- was estimated to provide, at most, 1, 300 IU of vitamin A/kg and the C+ to supply an extra amount of at least 800 IU vitamin A/kg. Compared with the pigs fed the C-, pigs fed with C+ had 3 -fold more retinoic acid (P < 0. 01) and 4 -fold more SCD gene expression in the liver (P = 0. 06). The diet did not affect performance traits and backfat thickness, but pigs fed the C+ had less fat (4. 0 vs. 5. 0 %; P = 0. 07) and MUFA (18. 3 vs. 22. 5 %; P = 0. 01) in the liver, less IMF (5. 4 vs. 8. 3 %; P = 0. 04) in the <b>GM,</b> and more <b>fat</b> content (90. 4 vs. 87. 9 %; P = 0. 09) and MUFA (48. 0 vs. 46. 6 %; P = 0. 04) in SF. The TT genotype at the SCD gene increased MUFA (P < 0. 05) in all tissues (21. 4 vs. 19. 5 % in the liver, 55. 0 vs. 53. 1 % in the LM, 53. 9 vs. 51. 7 % in the GM, and 48. 0 vs. 46. 7 % in SF for TT and CC genotypes, respectively). Liver fat and MUFA content nonlinearly declined with liver all-trans retinoic acid, indicating a saturation point at relatively low all-trans retinoic acid content. The results obtained provide evidence for a complementary role between dietary PVA and SCD genotype, in the sense that the TT pigs fed with a low-PVA diet are expected to show higher and more monounsaturated IMF without increasing total fat content...|$|R
