It was found through the analysis {{that the impact}} increases when {{a small amount of}} Gd 2 O 3 is added to pure UO 2 fuel although the impact decreases for a large amount of Gd 2 O 3. This tendency was discussed with the usage of simplified expression for the difference of <b>Doppler</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The simplified expression was used to consider the tendency, and it was revealed that the tendency mainly comes from the rapid decrement of multiplication factor and the relatively slow decrement of the magnitude of sensitivity coefficient of U- 238 capture cross section at low Gd 2 O 3 concentration. Similar tendency which shows a maximum impact on <b>Doppler</b> <b>coefficient</b> at interior concentration is expected for other UO 2 fuel with a slight content of strong absorber.

40|$|An {{operating}} {{nuclear power}} reactor {{is a complex}} system that is sensitive to many material parameters including densities, temperatures, and compositions. There is great interest in solving the neutron transport with Monte Carlo methods due to their extremely high fidelity, but Monte Carlo methods are too slow to run in an iterative brute-force search of the reactor parameter space. This thesis discusses the derivation, implementation, and applications of differential tallying [...] a method {{which can be used}} to mitigate the computational cost of mapping out a reactor parameter space with Monte Carlo. With differential tallies, each calculation provides derivatives of tallied quantities like reactivity and fission reaction rates with respect to material density, temperature, etc. These derivatives directly provide reactivity coefficients and they {{can also be used to}} extrapolate and predict small changes in reactor parameters. Notably, a novel method is presented which uses the windowed multipole cross section representation to compute temperature derivatives due to the resolved resonance Doppler broadening effect. To demonstrate the utility of differential tallies, this thesis presents example computations of moderator density and fuel <b>Doppler</b> feedback <b>coefficients</b> in pressurized water reactor pincells. With differential tallies, the moderator and fuel <b>Doppler</b> <b>coefficients</b> can be computed 40 % and 50 x faster, respectively, than by brute-force methods.

In the energy region analyzed, 1825. 0 to 2017. 0 eV, a direct application of the pseudo-resonance approach using a customary average strength function will not provide effective cross sections which fit the measured cross section behavior.

40|$|Calculations {{have been}} {{performed}} to assess the neutronic behavior of pins of Fully-Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel in otherwise-conventional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel pins. The FCM fuel contains transuranic (TRU) -only oxide fuel in tri-isotropic (TRISO) particles with the TRU loading coming from the spent fuel of a conventional LWR after 5 years of cooling. Use of the TRISO particle fuel would provide an additional barrier to fission product release {{in the event of}} cladding failure. Depletion calculations were performed to evaluate reactivity-limited burnup of the TRU-only FCM fuel. These calculations showed that due to relatively little space available for fuel, the achievable burnup with these pins alone is quite small. Various reactivity parameters were also evaluated at each burnup step including moderator temperature <b>coefficient</b> (MTC), <b>Doppler,</b> and soluble boron worth. These were compared to reference UO{sub 2 } and MOX unit cells. The TRU-only FCM fuel exhibits degraded MTC and <b>Doppler</b> <b>coefficients</b> relative to UO{sub 2 } and MOX. Also, the reactivity effects of coolant voiding suggest that the behavior of this fuel would be similar to a MOX fuel of very high plutonium fraction, which are known to have positive void reactivity. In general, loading of TRU-only FCM fuel into an assembly without significant quantities of uranium presents challenges to the reactor design. However, if such FCM fuel pins are included in a heterogeneous assembly alongside LEU fuel pins, the overall reactivity behavior would be dominated by the uranium pins while attractive TRU destruction performance levels in the TRU-only FCM fuel pins is.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a {{high power}} and high neutron flux {{research}} reactor operating in the United States. Powered with highly enriched uranium (HEU), the ATR has a maximum thermal power rating of 250 MWth. Because of the high total core power and high neutron flux, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting an HEU driven reactor to a low-enriched core. An optimized low-enriched uranium (LEU) (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case, which can meet the project requirements, has been selected. However, LEU contains a significant quantity of high density U- 238 (80. 3 wt. %), which will harden the neutron spectrum in the core region. Based on the reference ATR HEU and the optimized LEU full core plate-by-plate (PBP) models, the present work investigates and compares the neutron spectra differences in the fuel element (FE), Northeast flux trap (NEFT), Southeast flux trap (SEFT), and East flux trap (EFT) positions. A detailed PBP MCNP ATR core model was developed and validated for fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. The current ATR core with HEU U 235 enrichment of 93. 0 wt. % {{was used as the}} reference model. Each HEU fuel element contains 19 fuel plates with a fuel meat thickness of 0. 508 mm (20 mil). In this work, an optimized LEU (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case with a nominal fuel meat thickness of 0. 330 mm (13 mil) and the U- 235 enrichment of 19. 7 wt. % was used to calculate the impact of the neutron spectrum in FE and FT positions. MCNP-calculated results show that the neutron spectrum in the LEU FE is slightly harder than in the HEU FE, as expected. However, when neutrons transport through water coolant and beryllium (Be), the neutrons are thermalized to an equilibrium neutron spectrum as a function of water volume fraction in the investigated FT positions. As a result, the neutron spectrum differences of the HEU and LEU in the NEFT, SEFT, and EFT are negligible. To demonstrate that the LEU core fuel cycle performance can meet the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety requirements, additional studies will be necessary to evaluate and compare safety parameters such as void reactivity and <b>Doppler</b> <b>coefficients,</b> control components worth (outer shim control cylinders, safety rods and regulating rod), and shutdown margins between the HEU and LEU cores...|$|R

Because of these operating parameters, and the large test volumes located in high flux areas, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting an HEU driven reactor to a low-enriched core. The present work investigates the necessary modifications and evaluates the subsequent operating effects of this conversion. A detailed plate-by-plate MCNP ATR 1 / 8 th core model was developed and validated for a fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. Using the current HEU U- 235 enrichment of 93. 0 % as a baseline, an analysis can be performed to determine the low-enriched uranium (LEU) density and U 235 enrichment required in the fuel meat to yield an equivalent Keff between the HEU core and a LEU core versus effective full power days (EFPD). The MCNP ATR 1 / 8 th core model {{will be used to}} optimize the U 235 loading in the LEU core, such that the differences in Keff and heat profile between the HEU and LEU core can be minimized for operation at 125 EFPD with a total core power of 115 MW.

The MCWO-calculated results for the LEU case demonstrated adequate excess reactivity such that the Keff versus EFPDs plot is similar in shape to the reference ATR HEU case.

This study is also concerned with the effect of the intra-assembly representation in calculations. The issue is the error that might be present if assembly-average power is calculated, and pin peaking factors from a static calculation are then used to determine local fuel enthalpy. This is being studied {{with the help of a}} collaborative effort with Russian and French analysts who are using codes with different intra-assembly representations. The US code being used is PARCS which calculates power on an assembly-average basis. The Russian code being used is BARS which calculates power for individual fuel pins using a heterogeneous representation based on a Green`s Function method...|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} of the at-power moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) at the pressurized water reactor Unit 4 of the Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant (Sweden) during fuel cycle 16 is analyzed. The measurement was performed when the boron concentration decreased under 300 ppm in the reactor coolant system, by using the boron dilution method. Detailed calculations were made to estimate all reactivity effects taking place during such a measurement. These effects can only be accounted for through static core calculations that allow calculating contributions to the reactivity change induced by the moderator temperature change. All the calculations were performed with the Studsvik Scandpower SIMULATE- 3 code. Analysis of the measurement showed that {{the contribution of the}} Doppler effect (in the fuel) was almost negligible, whereas the reactivity effects due to other than the <b>Doppler</b> fuel <b>coefficient</b> and the boron change were surprisingly significant. It was concluded that due to the experimental inaccuracies, the uncertainty associated with the boron dilution method could be much larger than previously expected. The MTC might then be close to - 72 pcm/oC, whereas the main goal of the measurement is to verify that the MTC is larger (less negative) than this threshold. The usefulness of the boron dilution method for MTC measurements can therefore be questioned...|$|R
40|$|The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) has {{among its}} main goals the {{excellence}} in safety {{and reliability of}} the proposed innovative nuclear systems. The development of computational tools {{that are able to}} assist the design and safety analysis of these innovative reactor concepts is crucial. In this line, the JRC-IET is developing a static and dynamic integrated safety analysis platform with the objective to perform an integrated core and safety analysis of nuclear rector systems. The first application of this platform has been made in the framework of the Collaborative Project on European Sodium Fast Reactor (CP-ESFR) that is also part of EURATOM contribution to GIF. Two core designs have been currently proposed for the 3600 MWth sodium-cooled reactor concept based on oxide and carbide fuel respectively. Using the integrated safety analysis platform, static calculation on neutronics (incl. reactivity coefficients) and thermal-hydraulic characteristics for both oxide and carbide reference cores have been conducted. The quantities evaluated include: keff, coolant heat-up, void, and <b>Doppler</b> reactivity <b>coefficients,</b> axial and radial expansion reactivity coefficients, pin-by-pin calculated power profiles, average and peak channel temperatures. This paper presents the tools and the models applied in the study together with the relevant results for the oxide and carbide core. JRC. F. 5 -Nuclear Reactor Safety Assessmen...|$|R
