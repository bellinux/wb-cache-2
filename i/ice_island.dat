25|$|In {{addition}} to size classification, icebergs {{can be classified}} {{on the basis of}} their shape. The two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular. Tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top, much like a plateau, with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1. This type of iceberg, also known as an <b>ice</b> <b>island,</b> can be quite large, as in the case of Pobeda <b>Ice</b> <b>Island.</b> Antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf or Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, are typically tabular. The largest icebergs in the world are formed this way.|$|E
25|$|Panarctic's <b>ice</b> <b>island</b> wells {{were not}} the first {{offshore}} wells in the Canadian north. In 1971, Aquitaine (later known as Canterra Energy, then taken over by Husky Oil) drilled a well in Hudson Bay from a barge-mounted rig. Although south of the Arctic Circle, that well was in a hostile frontier environment. A storm forced suspension of the well, and the ultimately unsuccessful exploration program languished for several years.|$|E
25|$|Collecting oceanographic and hydrographic data en route, Seadragon transited the Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and McClure Strait. On 21 August, she {{completed}} the first submarine transit of the Northwest Passage, entered the Beaufort Sea, {{and headed for}} the North Pole, which she reached on 25 August. The ship surfaced through the thin ice becoming the third submarine to surface at the pole. Members of the crew laid out a softball diamond with the pitcher's box at the pole where the captain claimed he hit a fly ball at 4:00pm on Wednesday and it wasn't caught until 4:00am on Thursday. From the pole, Seadragon (having no other choice) turned south, and after conducting experiments in cooperation with scientists on <b>ice</b> <b>island</b> T-3, headed for the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. On 5 September, she reached Nome, Alaska, and, nine days later, she arrived at her home port, Pearl Harbor.

40|$|Abstract. Artificial, {{grounded}} <b>ice</b> <b>islands</b> {{built by}} controlled flooding {{of the sea}} ice surface with sea water {{have been used for}} exploratory drilling in the Arctic offshore. <b>Islands</b> fabricated from <b>ice</b> are becoming more prevalent as offshore oil speculation in the Arctic gains more interest. Ice has been a strategic building material in the Arctic for the construction of roads, airstrips, housing, and, in the last few decades, as temporary drilling platforms to explore for oil. This article describes various methods of artificial ice building, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using man-made <b>ice</b> <b>islands</b> for exploratory drilling...|$|R

50|$|The National Ice Center {{named the}} new iceberg, the Petermann <b>Ice</b> <b>Island</b> (2010) to {{differentiate}} {{it from a}} similar calving event two years earlier which produced Petermann <b>Ice</b> <b>Island</b> (2008).

40|$|In the 19702 ̆ 019 s and 19802 ̆ 019 s, {{a number}} of {{grounded}} <b>ice</b> <b>islands</b> were used as drilling platforms in the Beaufort Sea. These islands were constructed by spraying sea water into the air to form ice, gradually building up a large platform area that eventually grounded on the seabed. One {{important factor in the}} feasibility of using ice in such a manner concerns the sliding resistance of the grounded spray ice. Reports and papers from <b>ice</b> <b>islands,</b> relief well <b>ice</b> pads and spray ice barriers were studied in detail. This study provides both qualitative and quantitative knowledge on the sliding resistance of grounded spray ice structures. It illustrates that these structures were very stable with respect to seabed sliding. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In 2002 and 2003, {{offshore}} operators on the Grand Banks {{reported an}} unusually large number of <b>ice</b> <b>islands</b> and large tabular icebergs up to 20 million tonnes, with drafts of 65 to 80 m. This paper describes sightings of large tabular icebergs and <b>ice</b> <b>islands</b> in 2001 to 2003 north of the Grand Banks, from Lancaster Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to the Labrador and Newfoundland shelves. Based on the dimensions and surface appearance of the icebergs, the most probable source is the Petermann glacier.

I have several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same proportion. While north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable <b>ice</b> <b>islands,</b> some of which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water." ...|$|R
