25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines.

In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.|$|E

However, comparisons between predictions and reality indicate that these approaches are limited. Given the relevance of agricultural <b>international</b> <b>policies</b> {{for the life of}} millions and the impact on the environment, including initiatives linked to global environmental change, the framework used to develop such policies has to be clearly defined.
