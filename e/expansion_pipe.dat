40|$|Whether at {{the level}} of a single protein, or in the {{cytoplasm}} as a whole, the diffusive mobility of proteins {{plays a key role in}} biological function. To measure protein diffusion in cells, researchers have developed multiple fluorescence microscopy methods, and have tested them rigorously. However, using these methods for precise measurement of diffusion coefficients requires expertise that can be a barrier to broad utilization of these methods. Here, we report on a new method we have developed, which we name Photo-converted Intensity Profile <b>Expansion</b> (<b>PIPE).</b> It is a simple and intuitive technique that works on commercial imaging systems and requires little expertise. PIPE works by pulsing photo-convertible fluorescent proteins, generating a peaked fluorescence signal at the pulsed region, and analyzing the spatial expansion of the signal as diffusion spreads it out. The width of the expanding signal is directly related to the protein ensemble mean-square displacement, from which the diffusion coefficient of the ensemble is calculated. In the main part of the thesis, we demonstrate the success of PIPE in measuring accurate diffusion coefficients in silico, in vitro and in vivo. We then broaden the discussion, and challenge the assumption that the Fickian diffusion equation is the most appropriate model for describing protein motion in the cytoplasm. Since the cytoplasm is crowded with obstacles that trap proteins for a wide range of times, the motion of those proteins may be more accurately described by models of anomalous diffusion. To contribute to the ongoing debate about anomalous diffusion, we show how PIPE can be used to measure the degree of diffusion anomality by examining the temporal scaling of the mean-square displacement. Whether for measuring normal or anomalous diffusion, we suggest that the simplicity and user-friendliness of PIPE could make it a useful tool in molecular and cell biology. by Rotem Gura Sadovsky.

The first version of this electronic ignition was overly complex and proved unreliable, so Kawasaki gave up on it briefly, using traditional breaker points, one set for each cylinder, in 1972. For the 1973 H1D, a redesigned CDI was used, which was more reliable with a hotter spark at lower engine speeds, which in turn {{made it possible to}} re-jet the three Mikuni carburetors for a wider power band.

40|$|Noise {{radiated}} {{from high}} speed centrifugal compressors {{is becoming a}} significant design factor. The dominant noise components of a centrifugal compressor can be identified at its blade passing frequencies (BPFs), of which each is a strong tonal noise. Popular noise control methods of a centrifugal compressor includes building of sound insulation enclosure, wrapping of noise insulation materials, mounting of vibration absorbers, and etc. These noise control methods are more effective for broadband noise reduction. Thus, they are generally ineffective to reduce a tonal noise such as the BPF components of the centrifugal compressor. In this thesis, a quarter-wavelength resonator array installed at the outlet pipe of a single-stage centrifugal compressor is studied, which is aimed to reduce the tonal noise of the compressor. In order to optimally design the quarter-wavelength resonators, numerical simulations are performed by using a commercial software package, COMSOL Multiphysics ? Acoustics Module. The optimization procedure is to optimally select geometric design parameters of the quarter-wavelength resonator array such as the diameter and depth of each resonator, and the spacing between the resonators in the axial and circumferential directions. The next procedure is to investigate the effect of four different configurations (i. e., staggered and slanted resonators and the resonators mounted on an <b>expansion</b> <b>pipe</b> and a curved pipe) on the noise reduction performance. Then, the analyses of flow effects on the noise reduction performance of the resonator array are conducted both numerically and experimentally. The high speed air flow induced by the compressor results in wavenumber shifts of noise waves, thus influencing the tonal noise reduction performance of the resonator array. The numerical flow effect analyses are conducted by using commercial software packages, ANSYS FLUENT and ACTRAN. In particular, these software package are used to conduct hybrid aeroacoustic simulations, in which fluid flow and aeroacoustic noise analyses are conducted separately, based on {{the theory of the}} Lighthill?s aeroacoustic analogy. The numerical and experimental results show that the optimally designed quarter-wavelength resonator array can be used to achieve nearly 10 dB noise reduction. From these results, it is also shown that a relation between the Mach number of the airflow and the maximum performance frequency shift is represented as a quadratic curve of ?f = 1918 M^(2) - 24. 21 M where M is the Mach number and ?f is the frequency shift...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} and separation {{of oil and}} water is an essential process to the oil and chemical industries. Although transporting the mixtures is often necessary due to few reasons, it is generally beneficial to separate out the phases {{in order to reduce}} installation and maintenance costs, at the same time, avoiding safety problems. Thus, separation of liquid-liquid flows is a necessary part of many industrial processes. Hence, knowledge of two-phase flow dynamics is important for the design optimisation of separators. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility of a sudden pipe expansion to be used as phase separator because it compact in design and capable for converting dispersed flow to stratified flow. In the test section, spatial distribution of the liquid-liquid phases in a dynamics flow system was visualised for the first time for by means of capacitance Wire Mesh Sensor (CapWMS), providing instantaneous information about the interface shapes, waves and phase layer evolution of oil-water flow. Visual assessment and analysis of the WMS data showed three distinct layers: an oil layer at the pipe top; a water layer at the pipe bottom and a mixed layer between them. The interfaces that form between the separated phases (oil or water) and the mixed layer were classified as oil interface or water interface. Results showed interface shapes were initially concave or convex near to the inlet of the test section and became flat further downstream the expansion, especially for water interfaces. There were no waves observed for horizontal and downward pipe orientations at all flow conditions and axial position downstream of the expansion. As for the upward inclined pipe orientation, waves were found, and they formed at position close to the inlet at all input oil volume fraction except at 0. 2 OVF. The amplitude of the waves was: ~ 0. 29 D for 0. 8 OVF; ~ 0. 22 D for 0. 6 OVF and ~ 0. 26 D for 0. 4 OVF. The higher the input oil volume fraction, the larger the waves become. In conclusion, the WMS results demonstrated that spatial distributions are strongly dependent on the mixture velocity, input oil fraction and inclination angles for the far position. In this present work, droplets were found to be larger near the interface. Drops were large nearer to the interface at the near position (10 D) for all pipe orientations and throughout the test section for horizontal flow. The drops size decreased when the distance from the interface increased for these pipe configurations. As for the furthest position from the expansion for upward and downward inclined pipe orientation, larger droplets could also be seen at distance away from the interface and vice versa. The gravity or buoyant force is one of the contributing factors to the settling of the droplets. These forces are acting simultaneously on the droplets i. e. if the buoyant force which tends to spread the droplets throughout the pipe cross-section, is not large enough to overcome the settling tendency of gravity settling of the droplets occurs. Hence, the droplets that are non-uniformly scattered within the continuous phase begin to coalesce as they flow further downstream the pipe, producing larger drops. In addition, as the distance from expansion increased, the mixed layer becomes narrow and more drops begin to coalescence to form large drop due to increased droplet-droplet collision. Owing to these factors, results indicate that the mechanisms of coalescence occurred faster at the bottom, for water droplets and at the top, for oil droplets than the other locations in a pipe cross-section. For a better separation design, the coalescence process should occur at the aforementioned (bottom for water and top for oil) locations within the <b>expansion</b> <b>pipe.</b> However, at higher mixture velocities the mixed layer would be responsible for the smaller droplet size for horizontal and both inclinations of pipe orientation. The mixed layer dominated almost entirely in the pipe cross-section...|$|E

Four two-stage <b>pipe</b> <b>expansions</b> using standardly available materials were constructed and tested at common irrigation flow rates. These expansions require less space and cost less than optimum two-stage expansions. Pressure change across the <b>pipe</b> <b>expansions</b> were measured. The calculated head loss coefficients were compared to published values of abrupt, single-stage, and optimum two-stage <b>pipe</b> <b>expansions.</b> Head loss coefficients for the 50 - 100 mm and 75 - 150 mm two-stage expansions averaged 0. 32 and 0. 28 respectively. Loss coefficients for the 100 - 200 mm and 125 - 250 rim two-stage expansions averaged 0. 16 and 0. 17 respectively. The two-stage expansions operated more efficiently than abrupt and single-stage expansions and were economically practical for many pumping situations. The 50 - 100 mm two-stage expansion was only a slight improvement over a single-stage welding cone expansion. The fitting was economical as electricity prices rose over 0. 05 /kWh for crops requiring 3000 annual operating hours. The larger fittings became progressively better. The 75 - 150 mm expansion became economically practical at 0. 03 /kWh when operating more than 1, 600 hours. The 100 - 200 mm and 125 - 250 mm two-stage fittings were always practical. Beginning with the 75 - 150 mm size and increasingly with the next two larger sizes, optimum two-stage fittings became economically competitive. Optimum two-stage expansions operated most efficiently, but because of their high cost were only practical for high electricity costs and long irrigation seasons. The three largest two-stage expansions tested are improvements over abrupt or single-stage expansions when constructing a pump discharge. Replacing an existing, less efficient expansion may not be cost effective because the existing fitting cost is lost. While only a small part of an irrigation system, these two-stage expansions can improve system performance with little extra cost and without requiring difficult to obtain components...|$|R
