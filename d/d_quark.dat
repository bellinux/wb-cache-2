40|$|Deep inelastic {{structure}} {{functions for}} the nucleon are obtained in a constituent quark model {{on the light}} cone. In the Bjorken limit the parton model is derived. Structure functions from the hadronic tensor at the scale µ ∼ 0. 25 GeV are evolved from (0. 6 GeV) 2 to −q 2 ∼ 15 GeV 2.

The main effect of the spin force between quarks is described in terms of smaller (and lighter) scalar u − <b>d</b> <b>quark</b> pairs in the nucleon. To account for the negative slope of F n 2 p (x) /F 2 (x), attraction between scalar u − <b>d</b> <b>quark</b> pairs and incorporation of boosts are required.

40|$|We {{check the}} u and <b>d</b> <b>quark</b> {{contributions}} to the spin content of the Λ {{by means of the}} q → Λ fragmentation and find that the u and d quarks of the Λ are likely positively polarized.

With the Gribov-Lipatov relation between the quark distributions and fragmentation functions, the longitudinal spin transfer for the Λ production in the polarized charged lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS) process and the Λ-polarization in the neutrino (antineutrino) DIS process are predicted. The available experimental data suggests that the u and <b>d</b> <b>quark</b> {{contributions to the}} spin of the Λ are positive.
