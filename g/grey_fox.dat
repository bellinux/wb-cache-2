5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, <b>grey</b> <b>fox,</b> and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.|$|E
5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and <b>grey</b> <b>fox.</b> The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E
40|$|Archival {{specimens}} of gastric mucosa of 10 raccoons (Procyon lotor), 9 porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum), 6 <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), 6 bobcats (Lynx rufus), 4 skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and 3 black bears (Ursus americanus) were microscopically examined {{for evidence of}} Helicobacter-like organisms. Such organisms were seen in the specimens from the <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> and bobcats only. Histochemical stains (modified Steiner and carbol fuchsin methods) revealed long spiral organisms within lumina of gastric glands; however, neither gross nor microscopic lesions were observed.

Morphologically, 2 different phenotypes of spiral organisms were identified by EM.

2500|$|In America, fox {{hunting is}} also called [...] "fox chasing", {{as it is}} the {{practice}} of many hunts not to actually kill the fox (the red fox is not regarded as a significant pest). Some hunts may go without catching a fox for several seasons, despite chasing two or more foxes in a single day's hunting. Foxes are not pursued once they have [...] "gone to ground" [...] (hide in a hole). American fox hunters undertake stewardship of the land, and endeavour to maintain fox populations and habitats as much as possible. In many areas of the eastern United States, the coyote, a natural predator of the red and <b>grey</b> <b>fox,</b> is becoming more prevalent and threatens fox populations in a hunt's given territory. In some areas, coyote are considered fair game when hunting with foxhounds, even if they are not the intended species being hunted.|$|E

There was no doubt upon the terms of introduction; this could be no other than the {{forfeited}} Master of Lovat and chief of the great clan Fraser. I knew he had led his men in the Rebellion; I knew his father's head--my old lord's, that <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> of the mountains--to have fallen on the block for that offence, the lands of the family to have been seized, and their nobility attainted.

Nutting had a famous foxhound named Burgoyne--he pronounced it Bugine--which my informant used to borrow. In the [...] "Wast Book" [...] of an old trader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and representative, I find the following entry. Jan. 18th, 1742-3, [...] "John Melven Cr. by 1 <b>Grey</b> <b>Fox</b> 0--2--3"; they are not now found here; and in his ledger, Feb, 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit [...] "by 1/2 a Catt skin 0--1--4-1/2"; of course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble game. Credit is given for deerskins also, and they were daily sold. One man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here. I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the roadside and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.|$|E

40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; PubMedBackground: Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a {{vector-borne disease}} {{affecting}} humans and other mammals and {{caused by the}} protozoan parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn. L. chagasi), belonging to the L. donovani complex. The regions in Northern Argentina (above 32 degrees S) are its southern distribution limit in South America. Results: We detected Leishmania sp. DNA (most likely belonging to the L. donovani complex) in 37. 5 % of 32 <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pseudalopex griseus) captured in Argentinean Patagonia (48 degrees S and 50 degrees S). Eleven monosexual pools of Amblyomma tigrinum ticks from eight different <b>foxes</b> (six <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> and two culpeo foxes P. culpaeus) were also positive. The southernmost known distribution limit for L. infantum, and the southernmost reported capture of a phlebotominae, had previously been 2000 and 750 km north of our study area, respectively. Conclusions: This finding is significant because it markedly extends the distribution area of leishmaniasis; supports {{the existence of a}} sylvatic cycle in the absence of dogs; and has implications in transmission, indicating that either sand fly distribution is broader than currently thought or non-sand fly Leishmania maintenance is possible. Additional molecular, parasitological, epidemiological and entomological studies are still needed. [URL]...|$|R
