50|$|Apis cerana is {{the natural}} host to the mite Varroa jacobsoni and the {{parasite}} Nosema ceranae, both serious pests of the western honey bee. When first discovered near Beijing, China, in 1994, it was originally thought that Nosema ceranae was restricted to Apis cerana within in the East Asian region. However, {{it has now been}} confirmed that this parasite species is actually present in colonies of Apis mellifera as well, both in Taiwan as well as Spain, though the origins of its arrival in Europe are still unknown. Bees infected with Nosema ceranae suffer reduced lifespans as well as increased mortality in the winter and poor buildup and reduced <b>honey</b> <b>yield</b> in the spring. Having coevolved with these parasites, A. cerana exhibits more careful grooming than A. mellifera, thus has an effective defense mechanism against Varroa that keeps the mite from devastating colonies. Other than defensive behaviors such as these, much of their behavior and biology (at least in the wild) is very similar to that of A. mellifera.|$|E
5000|$|Saturation {{pollination}} is a pollination {{technique for}} agricultural crops in areas dominated by non-crop plant {{species that are}} preferred by pollinators.

50|$|The {{seasonal}} trend of typical infections exhibits low levels during summer, a small peak in autumn, and a slow rise of infection during winter.

In the spring, the level of infection increases rapidly as brood-rearing starts and while flight possibilities are still limited. Colonies in northern climates are more seriously affected than colonies in the south because of the increased amount of time bees are confined in the hive. Nosema, if left untreated, can cause queen supersedure, winter kills, reduced <b>honey</b> <b>yields,</b> and dwindling populations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outlook for}} meliponines in Mesoamerica is uncertain. The number of active Melipona beekeepers is rapidly declining {{in favor of}} the more economical, nonindigenous Africanized Apis mellifera. The high <b>honey</b> <b>yield,</b> 100 kg or more annually, along with the ease of hive care and ability to create new hives from {{existing}} stock, commonly outweighs the negative consequences of [...] "killer bee" [...] hive maintenance. Furthermore, Africanized honey bees do not visit some flora, such as those in the tomato family, and several forest trees and shrubs, which rely on the native stingless bees for pollination. A decline in populations of native flora has already occurred in areas where stingless bees have been displaced by Africanized honey bees. An additional blow to the art of meliponine beekeeping {{is that many of the}} meliponine beekeepers are now elderly, and their hives may not be cared for once they die. The hives are considered similar to an old family collection, to be parted out once the collector dies or to be buried in whole or part along with the beekeeper upon death. In fact, a survey of a once-popular area of the Mayan lowlands shows the rapid decline of beekeepers, down to around 70 in 2004 from thousands in the late 1980s. It is traditional in the Mayan lowlands that the hive itself or parts of the hive be buried along with the beekeeper to volar al cielo, [...] "to fly to heaven". Conservation efforts are underway in several parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
50|$|Though fruit {{growers and}} beekeepers were {{well acquainted with}} the vital role of Western honey bees in pollinating fruit blossoms, the role of these bees in alfalfa seed {{production}} was poorly understood. In the 1920s California beekeepers began migrating into Utah during the alfalfa bloom; at that time Utah being the largest alfalfa seed producing state in the US. When alfalfa first comes into bloom the flowers are bluish-purple and the fields have a bright cast. As the blossoms are pollinated the flowers fade and take on a grayish cast, making the field appear dull colored. Utah farmers were convinced that the bees were somehow damaging the blossoms, and persuaded the state legislature in 1930 to enact an embargo against bees entering the state from other states. Alfalfa seed yields from the fields declined so precipitously that the farmers were going bankrupt. The error was realized and the embargo rescinded in 1934; however Utah had forever lost its pre-eminent position as an alfalfa seed growing state, and California took the lead. After World War II, demand for alfalfa seed reached an all-time high. Normally alfalfa is planted in rotation with other crops, because, as a legume, it replenishes nitrogen in the soil. However, wartime needs had caused many alfalfa fields to be converted to vegetables and other crops thought to be more necessary to the war effort. Now, the farmers were trying {{to repair the damage}} done to soils by replanting alfalfa. While the demand was the highest in history, seed production was steadily declining. Increasing pesticide use and the increased utilization of fallow land and hedgerows was depleting wild pollinators to near the vanishing point. California beekeepers produced a high quality honey from alfalfa, and were willing to move bees to the alfalfa seed fields at a rate of one and a half hives per acre. Experience had shown this the maximum rate at which bees could be stocked without damaging the <b>honey</b> <b>yield</b> per hive. Vansell and Whitcombe had become convinced by their observations that the optimum rate for honey production for beekeepers was not sufficient for optimum pollination and seed production. Whitcombe notes that he always observed the heaviest seed set in the plants that were nearest the stands of bees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Avocado nectar {{is unusual}} because it {{contains}} perseitol, a 7 -carbon sugar alcohol. We compared avocado-nectar collection by commonly used Italian-based (IT) honey bee colonies and New World Carniolan (NWC) colonies introduced in avocado orchards in Israel (IS) and California (CA). In IS, NWC colonies had greater <b>honey</b> <b>yields</b> (1. 2 – 4. 3 fold), with a higher perseitol content (1. 1 – 5. 4 fold), than IT colonies. Overall, we calculated that NWC bees collected 1. 4 to 18. 1 times more avocado nectar than IT bees in the IS orchards. In CA, analyses of the crop contents of foragers revealed non-significant strain-specific trends in visitation to avocado flowers that were consistent with those indicated by data from IS. The genetic basis for honey bee differences in visitation to avocado flowers was further supported by the consistently high honey perseitol content of selected colonies over two years.

During the acquisition phase, A. mellifera showed higher learning scores than A. cerana. However, there was no statistical difference between the two species in the retention phase. Both species discriminated an experienced odor from a non-experienced odor. Our results suggested that A. cerana is equally amenable to the study of learning using the proboscis extension response paradigm supporting the behavioral evidence for future olfactory learning research with A. cerana...|$|R

40|$|The farming systems {{strongly}} intensified {{over the}} past 50 years, {{which led to a}} homogenization of agrosystems, now accounting for a high proportion of total land cover (e. g. 46 % in France and 61 % in the Poitou-Charentes French region). Mechanization of agricultural practices and increasing of inputs i. e. agrochemicals, resulted in losses in biodiversity in agricultural lands. While rapeseed and sunflower have favoured the development of beekeeping in cereal medium by providing almost 70 % of the total production of honey, beekeepers tend to desert these intensive cereal territories in favour of more diversified areas, richer in ressources. In parallel, beekeeping sustainability in farming landscapes is currently threatened, and beekeepers changed theirs activities by more intensive practices in order to compensate for colony losses and decreasing <b>honey</b> <b>yields.</b> Consequently, honeybees faced hazard gradient depending to the location of apiary. In this context, the choice of hive locations for honey production and honeybee conservation in intensive agrosystems remains a central issue.

ECOBEE is a colony monitoring scheme specifically ntended to provide beekeepers and researchers with basic ecological data on honeybees in intensive agrosystems, as well as colony population dynamics. ECOBEE was launched in 2008 as a long-term ecological project with three specific aims: 1. to monitor seasonal and inter-annual population dynamic parameters of honeybee colonies in a heterogeneous farming system; 2. to provide relevant and robust datasets to test specific hypotheses about bees such as the influence of landscape planning, agricultural inputs or human pressure; and 3. to offer opportunities for assessing the effectiveness of agro-environmental schemes or the effects of changes in agricultural policies on honey bee wellbeing. Here we present an overview of ECOBEE, the type of datasets collected over the first four years of monitoring, and their possible application and use. We found that colony dynamics were largely influenced by the phenology of the main mass-flowering crops foraged by bees, namely oilseed rape and sunflowers. Furthermore, we detected a sharp food shortage period in late spring between the flowering of oilseed rape and sunflowers, possibly temporarily constraining colony sustainability.

The average number of combs with bees throughout the experiment in Group I, Group II, Group III and Group IV was 10. 92 ± 0. 78, 14. 68 ± 0. 55, 10. 10 ± 0. 60, 7. 88 ± 0. 45 number combs/colony; the average of brood areas was 3078 ± 372. 5 cm 2, 3668 ± 460. 3 cm 2, 2215 ± 294. 0 cm 2, 1665. 38 ± 241. 8 cm 2; the average of wintering abil-ity was 84. 3 ± 2. 9 %, 88. 0 ± 3. 7 %, 46. 6 ± 19. 0 %, 26. 8 ± 16. 5 %; the survival rate was 100 %, 100 %, 60 %, 40 %; and the average of honey yields was 31. 4 ± 1. 89 kg, 41. 5 ± 1. 05 kg, 20. 4 ± 2. 62 kg and 12. 0 ± 1. 41 kg per colony, respectively. A significant and negative correlation between queen age and brood produc-tion (r=- 80. 2), colony strength (r=- 62. 5), wintering ability (r=- 66) and <b>honey</b> <b>yield</b> (r=- 75. 6) were cal-culated (P< 0. 01). The colonies headed by young queens had more brood areas, longer worker colony population, better wintering ability and greater <b>honey</b> <b>yield</b> in comparison to colonies headed by old queens...|$|E

40|$|Distribution Endemic {{to the six}} largest Hawaiian islands. Size Greatly variable, {{typically}} reaches 20 – 24 m (66 – 79 ft) in height; may be {{much smaller}} on lava rock or boggy soils. Habitat Wide range, 1 – 2500 m (1 – 8200 ft) elevation with rainfall of 400 – 10, 000 mm (16 – 400 in). Largest component of lowland and montane wet and mesic forests, dry forests, subalpine shrublands, and new lava flows. Vegetation Associated with dozens of other native species. Soils Very widely adapted, occurring on medium and heavy clay uplands; tolerates rocky soils and organic soils forming on recent lava flows. Growth rate Slow growing, 0. 3 – 0. 6 m (12 – 24 in) per year in height, and 1 – 3 mm (0. 04 – 0. 12 in) in stem diameter per year. Main agroforestry uses Windbreak, shade, ornamental. Main products Pole wood, fuelwood, <b>honey</b> source <b>Yields</b> High-volume, old-growth stands may yield 70 – 84 m 3 /ha (1000 – 1200 ft 3 /ac or 5000 – 6000 bf/ac); stands on poor soils such as lava rock may yield much less. Intercropping Used in farm cultivation only when naturally present due to very slow establishment and growth. Invasive potential Poses a serious risk of being invasive if introduced outside of Hawai‘i. Huge old ‘ōhi‘a tree at Kīpuka Puaulu, Hawai‘...|$|R
