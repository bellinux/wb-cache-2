5|$|In captivity studies, it {{has been}} {{discovered}} {{that most of the}} hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but sometimes hybrid females <b>die</b> <b>before</b> they reach sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} <b>die</b> <b>before</b> the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth. He was sickly as a young child—so much so that his mother feared he would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> he could be baptized. He later {{attributed}} his sickness to the poverty his family had to endure. The family moved twice {{while he was still}} young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where he would eventually have his funeral service.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making a quicker than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to <b>die</b> <b>before</b> their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Jaime Lannister {{arrives in}} King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, {{and returns to}} his sister Cersei Lannister. Cersei recounts the prophecy which Maggy the Frog told her as a child, when she was told all her {{children}} would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> her {{and she would be}} left with nothing. Jaime promises that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of he and Cersei staying close.|$|E
5|$|Nico di Angelo: The 10-year-old demigod son of Hades {{and older}} sister Bianca di Angelo are rescued from a manticore by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. He is left at camp during the quest, but {{stays in the}} Hermes cabin because his {{parentage}} {{has not yet been}} discovered. He leaves camp after hearing Percy broke his promise, letting Bianca <b>die.</b> <b>Before</b> he leaves, he sends an army of skeletal warriors back to the underworld.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend {{to fight}} and often <b>die</b> <b>before</b> reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} spawned a {{disastrous}} humanitarian crisis in Angola, internally displacing 4.28million people – one-third of Angola's total population. The United Nations estimated in 2003 that 80% of Angolans lacked access to basic medical care, 60% lacked access to water, and 30% of Angolan children would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> {{the age of}} five, with an overall national life expectancy of less than 40years of age.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as labetalol may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent <b>die</b> <b>before</b> reaching a hospital.|$|E

5|$|When a cell's DNA {{is damaged}} by a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} apoptosis. One {{of the results of}} apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself. Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not <b>die</b> <b>before</b> progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the <b>die</b> <b>before</b> each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{arrives at}} the {{building}} where Rachel perished, at which point Dent judges his fate, along with his own and Batman's, with three separate coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence caused his family to <b>die.</b> <b>Before</b> he can, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent's heroic image by holding Batman responsible for the killing spree. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs and {{walks out of the}} room, and Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter from Rachel about her choice to marry Dent.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman {{provides}} the Group with information {{leading them to}} Pocatello, Idaho, {{where a group of}} even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. Another possibility is that people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore <b>die</b> <b>before</b> reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
5|$|The median is {{the halfway}} point, {{which means that}} 50% of people will <b>die</b> <b>before</b> eight months, but the other half will live longer, {{potentially}} much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned {{that he should be}} in the favorable half of the upper statistical range. After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.|$|E

5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu <b>die</b> <b>before</b> the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{exclusively}} {{reported a}} new storyline for Hollyoaks as Mercedes and Joe Roscoe's (Ayden Callaghan) unborn baby would <b>die</b> <b>before</b> birth in scenes to air in early November 2015. It was revealed the show {{had been working}} with stillbirth charities, Count the Kicks and Sands to produce various ways mothers can monitor their unborn baby's progress. Rival soap opera, EastEnders, had produced a similar storyline when Shabnam Masood and Kush Kazemi (Rakhee Thakrar and Davood Ghadami) lost their son Zaair before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned {{months prior to the}} announcement of EastEnders storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.|$|E
