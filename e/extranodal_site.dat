40|$|Lymphoma may {{originate}} in <b>extranodal</b> <b>sites.</b> <b>Extranodal</b> lymphoma {{may also be}} secondary to and accompany nodal disease.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 75 -year old man that came at hematologist’s {{attention}} for lymphoma evaluation due to axillary lymph node enlargement and fever. Thorax, abdomen and pelvis Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) showed lymph nodes, spleen and liver lesions. Axillary lymph node biopsy was performed and the diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) at stage IV was postulated, then the patient was submitted to chemotherapy (CHT) following the R-CVP scheme. After the end of the eighth cycle of CHT he was submitted to a restaging CECT that showed lymph nodes size reduction in all the sites identified on the staging exam. Furthermore the liver lesions disappeared and spleen lesions size was reduced. A whole-body and head 18 F-FDG PET/CT was also performed that showed 18 F-FDG uptake lesions in right axillary lymph nodes, spleen and liver and the identification of two more <b>extranodal</b> <b>sites,</b> respectively in conjunctiva and skin.

40|$|Objective: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the anatomic distribution, clinical features and outcome of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Patients according to the primary site (extranodal vs. nodal) with applicability of International Prognostic Index (IPI). Methodology: A retrospective review (1988 to 2004) of 557 cases of DLBC. Results: The median age was 48. 7 +/- 15. 3 years, M:F ratio was 2 : 1. The distribution according to the primary site was: lymph node (N-NHL), 322 cases (58 %) of which 145 (44 %) were stage IV, 76 (23 %) stage III, 60 (18 %) stage II and 47 (15 %) stage I. The extra nodal sites (EN-NHL) 235 (42 %) cases included gastro-intestinal tract (44 %), upper aerodigestive tract (19 %), bones (8 %), spine (5 %), and unusual sites less than 3 % each as breast, CNS, testis, lungs and skin. The median survival rate was 4. 8 years and 6. 3 years in N-NHL and EN-NHL respectively. In the latter this varied greatly depending on the primary site and stage of disease at presentation. In the univariate analysis factors associated with good prognosis were: age less than 60 years, early stage (I-II), extranodal involvement primarily gastric or bone, 0 - 1 <b>extranodal</b> <b>site,</b> 0 - 1 performance status, lack of B symptoms and normal LDH level. In the multivariate analysis age, performance status, stage of disease and level of LDH were the main variables predicting overall survival, no nodal or <b>extranodal</b> <b>site</b> maintained their prognostic value. Conclusion: Patients with EN-NHL present more frequently with early stage disease then those with N-NHL, overall survival in both groups largely depended on IPI and not on the site of origin of the malignancy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract is {{the most}} common <b>extranodal</b> <b>site</b> of involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Primary GI NHL is frequently discussed in survival analyses. Primary intestinal NHL is significantly different from primary gastric NHL with regard to its clinical features, pathological subtype, treatment and prognosis. The small intestine is involved in lymphoma less often than the large intestine. The present study aimed to analyze the clinical and pathological characteristics of primary NHL of the small intestine and its prognostic factors. A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data from 313 cases of NHL that occurred between 1995 and 2008 in the Tri-Service General Hospital (National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan). Among these cases, 11 cases of primary NHL of the small intestine were identified. A Cox model was used t...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. High-dose {{chemotherapy}} with autologous {{stem cell}} transplantacion (ASCT) has shown to produce long-term disease-free survival {{in patients with}} chemotherapysensitive Hodgkin disease. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate efficacy of ASCT in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. Methods. Between May 1997 and September 2008, 34 patients with Hodgkin's disease in median age of 25 (range 16 - 60) years, underwent ASCT. Autologous SCT were performed as consolidation therapy in one poor-risk patients with complete response (CR) and in 10 patients in partial remission (PR) after induction chemotherapy (32. 5 %), for chemosensitive relapse (CSR 1 and CSR 2) in 47 % patients and in 20. 5 % patients with chemoresistant disease (CRD). All except one patient were in stage III/IV, <b>extranodal</b> <b>site</b> of disease had 24 patients and bulky disease had l 0 patients. All the patients received a uniform preparatory regimen (BEAM). Results. An overall response was achieved in 30 of 32 evaluated patients, with 62. 5 % in CR and 31. 25 % in PR. After applying radiotherapy, two patients with PR after ASCT reached CR. Median follow-up was 15. 5 months (range 3 - 133 months). The probability of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at a 3 -year period for all patients was 51. 9 % and 48. 9 %, respectively. For 22 patients in CR after ASCT, a 3 -year DFS was 66. 5 %. Estimates of 2. 5 -year survival were 14. 3 %, 61. 9 % and 100 % for CRD, CSR and for patients with CR/PR, respectively (p < 0. 01). However, when patients undergoing consolidation were analyzed separately from those in CSR, no significant difference in OS and PFS was observed according to the disease status at ASCT. In univariate analysis for OS, PFS i DFS, <b>extranodal</b> <b>site</b> of disease and disease bulk had no predictive value. Twelve patients died. The main cause of death was Hodgkin's disease. Transplant-related mortality was 3. 1 %. One patient with CRD developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia and died 28 months after the transplantation. Conclusion.
