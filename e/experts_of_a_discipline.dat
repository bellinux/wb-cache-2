Academic discourse can be studied to see {{the ways in which the}} <b>experts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>discipline</b> construct their own activity in terms of a "conversation" within and around the scientific community. The tools of corpus analysis, especially with reference to small, specialized corpora, have greatly contributed to the study of language variation across genres and across disciplines both from a descriptive as well as from a didactic point of view...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the species concept of Ernst Mayr does not {{consider}} the evolution and modes of reproduction of eucaryotic organisms as a whole. It is only translatable into a taxonomic practice in a very special situation: sexually reproducing and sympatrically occurring organisms that do not exchange genes. Mayr’s central criterion of reproductive isolation is not applicable to the pervasive cases of reticulate evolution, to numerous groups of organisms with asexual reproduction, to the frequent situations of allopatry and to classification of fossil organisms. Evaluating {{advantages and disadvantages of}} five broadly applied species concepts and integrating elements of the related concepts of Sonneborn (1957), Sokal & Crovello (1970) and De Queiroz (2007), a new synthesis, called the Pragmatic Species Concept, is presented: ‘A species is a cluster of organisms which passed a threshold of evolutionary divergence. Divergence is determined by one or several operational criteria described by an adequate numerics. A single conclusive operational criterion is sufficient. Conflicts between operational criteria require an evolutionary explanation. Thresholds for each operational criterion are fixed by consensus among the <b>experts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>discipline</b> under the principle of avoiding over-splitting. Clusters must not be the expression of intraspecific polymorphism. ’ This concept is applicable to all known groups of eukaryotic organisms independent from their mode of reproduction or evolutionary history. It allows both an approach by multisource integrative taxonomy as well as by a single discipline and is open for integrating new disciplines. The concept enables sound taxonomic decisions also in case of reticulate evolution, parthenogenesis, apomixis, allopatry, separate time horizons and reversal of strong evolutionary divergence. The complex problem could only be solved by focusing on the degree of evolutionary divergence, reproducible numeric data recording, adequate numeric analyses and the threshold principle. Recommendations of how to translate this concept into a taxonomic practice are given...|$|E

Disciplines that are better aligned with the epistemic assumptions of evaluation standards appear to produce more "scientific" findings. To restore epistemic justice in research evaluation, we argue that the specificity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>discipline's</b> epistemic aims, values, and cultural identities {{must be taken into}} account...|$|R
