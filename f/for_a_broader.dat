5|$|Swedish {{is officially}} the main {{language}} of Sweden. Swedish {{is also one}} of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden it has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system but remained only a de facto primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, the sampan-men of Penang harbour went on strike.

In December 1908, the Government acted on Bland's suggestion and a Committee comprising Judge L. E. P. Wolferstan (Chairman), Harbour Master Commander D. C. MacIntyre R.N.R., and Assistant Protector of Chinese David Beatty was appointed to enquire into the complaints of the sampan men of Penang.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{original}} 1971 definition, the memristor was the fourth fundamental circuit element, forming a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011 Chua argued <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> definition that included all 2-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching. Williams argued that MRAM, phase change memory and RRAM were memristor technologies. Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs {{and other forms of}} RRAM were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.|$|E

25|$|Fasting, {{which plays}} so {{essential}} {{a part in}} the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only {{in the development of the}} Day of Atonement. The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. Isaiah (lviii.), while appealing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the Hafṭarah for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.|$|E
25|$|Tactical {{media in}} video games plays {{a crucial role}} in making a {{statement}} or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point. For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include Darfur is Dying, Finding Zoe, and In The Balance. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events in an intelligent and well thought out manner.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Christopher Hoch and Percussion Instructor Mr. Mark Reynolds, a decision was made to expand the band {{for the first time in}} over 40 years. Three additional band members were added; one each on bass drum, cymbals, and tenor drums. This allows for four of each part for the Ramp entrance, while expanding the percussion section by three for halftime. The driving decision to allow this expansion is to bring the band's percussion section closer in number and substance to other comparable college marching bands by having a full tonal bass drum section. From 2005 to 2015, the band used four tonal bass drums for halftime, which presents a challenge to percussion writers, as the standard instrumentation of a bass drum line is five drums. The addition of the fifth bass drum allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> color of percussion parts to be written. The traditional Ramp entrance block band will still maintain four bass drums tuned to two pitches, high and low, for effect.|$|E
