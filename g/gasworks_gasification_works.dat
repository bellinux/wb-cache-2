40|$|With {{the limited}} {{reserves}} {{of fossil fuels}} and the environmental problems associated with their use, the world is moving towards cleaner, renewable, and sustainable sources of energy. Biomass is a promising feedstock towards attaining this goal because it is abundant, renewable, and {{can be considered as}} a carbon neutral source of energy. Syngas can be further processed to produce liquid fuels, hydrogen, high value chemicals, or it can be converted to heat and power using turbines. Most of the downstream processing of syngas occurs at high pressures, which requires cost intensive gas compression. It has been considered to be techno-economically advantageous to generate pressurized syngas by performing high-pressure gasification. Gasification utilizes high temperatures and an oxidizing gas to convert biomass to synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of CO and H 2). Most of the past studies on gasification used process conditions that did not simulate an industrial <b>gasification</b> operation. This <b>work</b> aims at understanding the chemical and physical transformations taking place during high-pressure biomass gasification at heating rates of practical significance. We have adopted an approach of breaking down the gasification process into two steps: 1) Pyrolysis or devolatalization (fast step), and 2) Char gasification (slow step). This approach allows us to understand pyrolysis and char gasification separately and also to study the effect of pyrolysis conditions on the char gasification kinetics. Alkali and alkaline earth metals in biomass are known to catalyze the gasification reaction.

40|$|Under Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 36 - 00 GO 10529 for the Department of Energy, General Atomics (GA) is {{developing}} Supercritical Water Partial Oxidation (SWPO) {{as a means}} of producing hydrogen from low-grade biomass and other waste feeds. The Phase I Pilot-scale Testing/Feasibility Studies have been successfully completed and the results of that effort are described in this report. The Key potential advantages of the SWPO process is the use of partial oxidation in-situ to rapidly heat the gasification medium, resulting in less char formation and improved hydrogen yield. Another major advantage is that the high-pressure, high-density aqueous environment is ideal for reaching and gasifying organics of all types. The high water content of the medium encourages formation of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich products and is especially compatible with high water content feeds such as biomass materials. The high water content of the medium is also effective for gasification of hydrogen-poor materials such as coal. A versatile pilot plant for exploring gasification in supercritical water has been established at GA's facilities in San Diego. The Phase I testing of the SWPO process with wood and ethanol mixtures demonstrated gasification efficiencies of about 90 %, comparable to those found in prior laboratory-scale SCW <b>gasification</b> <b>work</b> carreid out at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) as well as other biomass gasification experience with conventional gasifiers. As in the prior work at UHM, a significant amount of the hydrogen found in the gas phase products is derived from the water/steam matrix. The studies at UHM utilized an indirectly heated gasifier with an acitvated carbon catalyst. In contrast, the GA studies utilized a directly heated gasifier without catalyst, plus a surrogate waste fuel. Attainment of comparable gasification efficiencies without catalysis is an important advancement for the GA process, and opens the way for efficient hydrogen production from low-value, dirty feed materials. The Phase I results indicate that a practical means to overcome limitations on biomass slurry feed concentration and preheat temperatuare is to coprocess an auxiliary high heating value material. SWPO coprocessing of tow hgih-water content wastes, partially dewatered sewage sludge and trap grease, yields a scenario for the production of hydrogen at highly competitive prices.

An existing coal Entrained Flow Gasification (EFG) Reduced Order Model (ROM) was expanded to more accurately simulate the gasification of a mixed feedstock of biomass and coal. The GE 2700 tpd gasifier was used because it is a widely used technology. The characteristics and state of the art in biomass conversion models were applied in the expanded ROM to model coal-biomass mixture gasification. Biomass has higher oxygen content and lower fixed carbon content than coal. Therefore, as results show, increasing the mass fraction of wood leads to a rise in temperature and drop in syngas heating value and Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE).

This research focussed on IGCC with coal as a feedstock in an attempt to establish the applicability of this technology in South Africa. Fluidised bed gasification technology was found to be the fine coal gasification technology in IGCC with greatest potential when considering the qualities of coals currently being used in local power stations. <b>Gasification</b> test <b>work</b> on four selected South African coals was undertaken at the CSIR gasification testing facility, to assess the behaviour and compatibility of these coals with fluidised bed gasification.

Basically it involves drilling a pair of wells into a coal seam and injecting gasifying agent like oxygen or air and steam through the Injector and after ignition and gasification of coal, the gas is brought to the surface through the other hole (Producer) and used as fuel or chemical feedstock. The first experimental work {{can be traced back}} to 1912 when William Ramsey began work in Durham, U. K. Intensive coal <b>gasification</b> <b>work</b> began in the then USSR in 1930 s at a shallower depth. This led to industrial scale projects in several parts particularly in Russia and Uzbekistan. One project of Uzbekistan is still operational. These trials established the basic technology of UCG. There was a renewed interest in UCG in Western Europe in view of energy shortage in 1944 - 1959. Borehole method was tested in Newmann Spinney and Bayton in U. K. This could not be sustained for long as during 1960 s, low cost fuel was available in plenty and therefore there was a period of lull on the progress of UCG in Europe. Oil/gas price and supply have dictated the pace of progress in UCG. After the first oil crisis, USA again embarked on the development of UCG in 1972 and continued in 1980 s, involving in the process a number of institutes and agencies. This led to considerable technological development. There were concerns on environmental pollution which the trial raised. It was thought appropriate to test the application of technological developments that had taken placed in oil and gas industry in UCG. In 1990 s deviation and in seam drilling was tried in “Al Tremidal” in Spain. The trial was successful and it proved the viability of directional drilling and benefits of CRIP technology (Controlled Retractable and Injection Point). As a result of Spanish trial, Department of Trade and Industry Technology (DTI), U. K., emphasized growing importance of UCG as clean coal technology. In its report of 2004 on the Review of Feasibility of UCG in U. K., UCG has been identified as an additional source for energy security within the context of a low carbon economy, if planning and environmental issues can be dealt with. China has carried out 16 field trials since 1980 s and has involved a number of agencies in order to address various issues in a comprehensive manner. Technology transfer agreement was executed with DTI-UK and a UCG Centre has been created in China University of Mining and Technology. Attempts are also being made in China to carry out gasification at deeper depths. Recently Australia has carried out a successful trial in Chinchila involving several agencies like Sydney University, Ergo Energy, Linc Energy, GE etc. Japan has overseas coal interests and has involved University of Tokyo for experimental studies. New Zealand carried out a small trial in 1994 with the help of USA. Other countries like Pakistan, Ukraine and Romania are also interested in UCG. In India, a beginning was made in UCG in 1980 s. Two pilot bore holes were drilled north of Mehsana town of Gujarat to see the suitability of application of UCG technique. However, further study on the subject has not been made since then. Recently there has been a surge of interest in UCG and as a consequence ONGC has signed an agreement with Skochinsky Institute of Mining (SIM), Russia.

Its chracteristics in low quality can be improved by pretreatment, i. e., torrefaction process, addressed by slow heating of biomass on wet or dry conditions on atmosphere pressure for 1 hour before it is used as feedstock <b>gasification.</b> This preliminary <b>work</b> features an experimental investigation of torrefaction process of Indonesian sugarcane cane bagasse. Temperature of torrefaction varies from 150, 175, 200, 225, 250 and 300 °C. For bagasse gasification process, the optimum temperature of dry torrefaction is 150 °C. At this temperature, yield of syngas will higher than other torrefaction temperature. Temperature of dry torrefaction will give energy saving opportunities than that's of wet torrefaction (180 °C, 1 hr). Analysis ultimate and proximate also indicate that sugarcane bagasse with temperature torrefaction 150 °C give better result than other torrefaction's temperature in high content of hydrogen and low content of carbon...|$|R

This research has abundant applications in energy, chemical, and conversion processes. Common use of these technologies includes catalytic cracking for petroleum refineries, fluidized bed reactors (type of chemical reactor), interface modification, and has been an important technology breakthrough in coal <b>gasification.</b> The present <b>work</b> will concentrate on the investigation and validation of gas-solid flows utilizing numerical methods. The gas-solid flows study on this research assumes the solid and gas phases as continua with averaged properties. ^ The fluid flow computation was achieved using two different solvers: 1) FLUENT a general-purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. FLUENT technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries, 2) MFIX (Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges) a solver developed at the Department of Energy 2 ̆ 7 s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for multiphase flows. MFIX is a general-purpose hydrodynamic model that describes chemical reactions and heat transfer in dense or dilute fluid-solids flows, typical in energy conversion and chemical processing reactors.

40|$|The {{presented}} work aims {{to provide}} information on solid biomass conversion into fuel gas {{as a result of}} air and steam gasification process. In contrary to the conventional <b>gasification</b> in this <b>work</b> highly preheated air and steam is used as a gasifying agent. Preheat of air and steam is realised by means of the high-cycle regenerative air/steam preheater. Use of highly preheated gasifying media provides additional energy into the gasification process, that enhances the thermal decomposition of the gasified solids. The objective of this work is {{to provide information}} on the process of biomass wastes to fuel gas using high temperature air and steam gasification. High Temperature Air/Steam Gasification of biomass wastes has very clear economical and environmental benefits. It will increase consumption of biomass thus decreases CO 2 emissions from energy intensive industries. Apart from CO 2 reduction possibility the new process, High Temperature Gasification has the following advantages:- No land filing of ash residues is required,- No need to treat ashes from gasification since there is no ash or at least no carbon in the ash produced,- Clean fuel gas for combustion and production of heat or electricity. In this work high temperature air and steam gasification of wood pellets in a fixed bed, updraft gasifier is tested...|$|R
40|$|General Atomics (GA) is {{developing}} Supercritical Water Partial Oxidation (SWPO) {{as a means}} of producing hydrogen from low-grade biomass and other waste feeds. The Phase I Pilot-scale Testing/Feasibility Studies have been successfully completed and the results of that effort are described in this report. The key potential advantage of the SWPO process is the use of partial oxidation in-situ to rapidly heat the gasification medium, resulting in less char formation and improved hydrogen yield. Another major advantage is that the high-pressure, high-density aqueous environment is ideal for reacting and gasifying organics of all types. The high water content of the medium encourages formation of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich products and is especially compatible with high water content feeds such as biomass materials. The high water content of the medium is also effective for gasification of hydrogen-poor materials such as coal. A versatile pilot plant for exploring gasification in supercritical water has been established at GA's facilities in San Diego. The Phase I testing of the SWPO process with wood and ethanol mixtures demonstrated gasification efficiencies of about 90 %, comparable to those found in prior laboratory-scale SCW <b>gasification</b> <b>work</b> carried out at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), as well as other biomass gasification experience with conventional gasifiers. As in the prior work at UHM, a significant amount of the hydrogen found in the gas phase products is derived from the water/steam matrix. The studies at UHM utilized an indirectly heated gasifier with an activated carbon catalyst. In contrast, the GA studies utilized a directly heated gasifier without catalyst, plus a surrogate waste fuel. Attainment of comparable gasification efficiencies without catalysis is an important advancement for the GA process, and opens the way for efficient hydrogen production from low-value, dirty feed materials. The Phase I results indicate that a practical means to overcome limitations on biomass slurry feed concentration and preheat temperature is to coprocess an auxiliary high heating value material. SWPO coprocessing of two high-water content wastes, partially dewatered sewage sludge and trap grease, yields a scenario for the production of hydrogen at highly competitive prices. It is estimated that there are hundreds if not thousands of potential sites for this technology across the US and worldwide. The economics for plants processing 40 tpd sewage sludge solids augmented with grease trap waste are favorable over a significant range of cost parameters such as sludge disposal credit and capital financing. Hydrogen production costs for SWPO plants of this size are projected to be about $ 3 /GJ or less. Economics may be further improved by future developments such as pumping of higher solids content sludges and improved gasifier nozzle designs to reduce char and improve hydrogen yields. The easiest market entry for SWPO is expected to be direct sales to municipal wastewater treatment plants for use with sewage sludge in conjunction with trap grease, as both of these wastes are ubiquitous and have reasonably well-defined negative value (i. e., the process can take credit for reduction of well-defined disposal costs for these streams). Additionally, waste grease is frequently recovered at municipal wastewater treatment plants where it is already contaminated with sewage. SWPO should also be favorable to other market applications in which low or negative value, high water content biomass is available in conjunction with a low or negative value fuel material. For biomass slurries primary candidates are sewage sludge, manure sludge, and shredded and/or composted organic municipal solid waste (MSW) slurries. For the high heating value stream primary candidates are trap grease, waste plastic or rubber slurries, and coal or coke slurries. Phase II of the SWPO program will be focused on verifying process improvements identified during Phase I, and then performing extended duration testing with the GA pilot plant. Tests of at least 100 hours duration using sewage sludge and trap grease as simultaneous feedstocks are a primary objective. Follow-on Phases III and IV of the SWPO program will develop and demonstrate a dedicated 5 tpd reduced-scale SWPO facility at a location such as the Encina municipal wastewater treatment plant. Subsequent to this demonstration, the technology will be ready for a commercial-scale demonstration. While there are clearly technical challenges that must still be addressed, SWPO represents an outstanding opportunity to further the dual goals of developing a hydrogen economy and practicing environmentally friendly waste disposal. It may well represent one of the few scenarios in which hydrogen may be produced economically from biomass at a relatively small scale. SWPO could thus play a pivotal role in the proliferation of distributed hydrogen generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{supercritical}} water gasification of Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgae {{has been}} studied in term of process development at 24  MPa and 663  °C. Gasification has been investigated using a 200  cm 3 down flow reactor working continuously. The effect of microalgae slurry concentration, with or without alkali catalysts, was studied. Moreover, {{the role played by}} different constituents of microalgae on gasification was investigated. Particularly, gasification of amino acids, carbohydrates and model mixtures among them was studied. Nannochloropsis gaditana was successfully gasified up to 97. 4  wt% as gasification efficiency and 86. 0  wt% as carbon efficiency. The product gas is mainly composed of hydrogen (52. 0 %), methane (17. 9 %) and CO 2 (23. 0 %). Gasification of pure amino acids, which are the main components of microalgae, showed a very different resistance to gasification depending on the molecular structure of the molecules. Among the amino acid that have been studied in this <b>work,</b> <b>gasification</b> resistance is in the order glycine > leucine > glutamic acid, whereas CH 4 concentration increases in order leucine > glutamic acid > glycine due to the number of methyl groups that are present in the molecules. From this work it can be concluded that gasification of microalgae is feasible in a continuous mode and that, depending on their molecular structure, amino acids offer a different resistance to gasification. These results can be of help in evaluating the feasibility of gasification of defatted microalgae after extraction of the oil...|$|R
40|$|Solid wastes, and {{especially}} RDF {{in dealing with}} the growing presence of organic compounds, mainly plastics, can be considered an important source of energy owing to their inexpensiveness and large availability. However, the presence of heavy metals in the waste can result in a recycling problem when thermal treatment is involved. In fact, small amounts of these metal species {{can be found in the}} gaseous stream, and this is particularly true for <b>gasification</b> processes. This <b>work</b> investigates the possibility of using theoretical calculations to evaluate the amount of volatile metal species in the gas stream, obtained by a gasification process, in order to select the adequate gas cleaning facilities. To this aim, the chemistry and volatility of the heavy metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn, commonly present in RDF, were investigated both theoretically and experimentally at different gasification conditions. A theoretical approach at equilibrium conditions based on thermodynamic data was performed by means of the total Gibbs free energy minimization method. The equilibrium distribution of the trace element species formed under reducing conditions in the 700 - 1300 K temperature range was calculated. The theoretical results are in substantial accordance with experimental data obtained using a bench scale gasification reactor. This study demonstrates that is possible to predict with reasonable conditions the operating conditions of a RDF gasifyier in order to obtain a syngas with a controlled content of polluting compounds...|$|R
40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión post-print. - Available online February 9, 2012 The Chemical-Looping Combustion of coal in {{the reactor}} {{system has been}} {{proposed}} as an interesting option to process a solid fuel in a CLC system. In this process, a solid fuel is directly fed to the fuel reactor in a CLC system. Solid fuel pyrolysis, char gasification and oxidation of gaseous products by reaction with the oxygen-carrier are the main chemical processes happening in the fuel reactor. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the performance of ilmenite as oxygen-carrier for CLC of coal regarding to the conversion of gaseous products from char gasification. Successive reduction-oxidation cycles were carried out in a fluidized bed using bituminous coal char as reducing agent. The changes on chemical and physical properties of ilmenite particles were determined. An activation process of ilmenite through the redox cycles was evidenced which was justified by an increase of porosity. The results showed that the activation for ilmenite reduction reaction was completed after 7 redox cycles. However, the oxidation reaction rate was increasing still after 16 redox cycles because the porosity was not fully developed. The gasification reaction rate and the ilmenite reactivity were analyzed. The effect of ilmenite itself and the influence of the gasification agent, i. e. H 2 O, CO 2 or H 2 O/CO 2 mixtures, and temperature on the gasification rate were evaluated. Limited use of CO 2 in the fluidizing gas was identified in order to maintain high gasification rates. Higher temperature improved the char gasification rate, mainly using steam as gasification agent, and the combustion efficiency of the gasification products. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature on the combustion efficiency was of lower relevance than that on the gasification rate. Finally, a theoretical approach was developed to easily evaluate the conversion of char in the fuel-reactor by <b>gasification.</b> This <b>work</b> was partially supported by the European Commission, under the RFCS program (ECLAIR Project, Contract RFCP-CT- 2008 - 0008), from Alstom Power Boilers and by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Project ENE 2010 - 19550).
