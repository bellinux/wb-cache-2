5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a native pony <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> Wales before 1600 BC. The original Welsh Mountain Pony {{is thought to have}} evolved from this prehistoric Celtic pony. Welsh ponies were primarily developed in Wales, and their ancestors <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> the British Isles prior to the arrival of the Roman Empire. Bands of ponies roamed in a semi-feral state, climbing mountains, leaping ravines, and running over rough moorland terrain.|$|E
