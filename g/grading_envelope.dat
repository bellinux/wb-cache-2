Taking AC- 20 and SMA- 20 as examples, selected 6 groups of representative grading curves within the <b>grading</b> <b>envelope</b> {{proposed by the}} present specification, and calculated their fractal dimensions. The asphalt mixture gradation has fractal dimension D (D∈(1, 3)), and the fractal of continuous gradation is single while the fractal of gap-gradation shows multi-fractal with 4. 75 as the dividing point. Fractal dimension of aggregate gradation of asphalt mixture reflect the structure characteristics of aggregate distribution, that is, finer is aggregate, bigger is the fractal dimension...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the problem regarding asphalt concrete mixtures, concretely ACO 11 +. This type of mixture has low resistance to permanent deformation (rutting) while high temperatures are present. The binder and aggregate tests regarding physical and mechanical properties were carried out. Subsequently the new mixture was designed {{on the basis of}} stricter requirement for <b>grading</b> <b>envelope</b> and air void content. The design mixture was tested for resistance to permanent deformation. From the obtained results the change in the national annex of the standard ČSN EN 13108 - 1 is considered in terms of change in testing temperature for some kinds of binders. The same tests were conducted in others asphalt laboratories in the Czech Republic to ensure the maximum comparability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of a study about the {{mechanical}} behavior of dense graded asphalt-rubber hot mixes (<b>grading</b> <b>envelope</b> C of DNER-ES 313 / 97) prepared with two different types of asphalt-rubber binders. These asphalt-rubber binders were obtained with penetration grade asphalt (AC 50 / 70) mixed with 21 % and 25 % of crumb rubber in weight. The rubber was recycled from unserviceable tires using the ambient grinding process. Hot mixes made with the conventional binder AC 50 / 70 were also studied for comparison. The mechanical behavior of hot mixes was evaluated through laboratory tests for fatigue life, permanent deformation and indirect tensile strength. The results showed that asphalt-rubber hot mixes presented better mechanical behavior for fatigue life and permanent deformation than those obtained with the straight binder...|$|E

40|$|The {{modification}} {{process of}} hot mix asphalts in which crumb rubber is initially {{mixed with the}} mineral aggregates before {{the addition of the}} binder is known as dry process. This process has as main advantages the use of conventional mixing plants and, at least in principle, has no limitation of the incorporated rubber content. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of the incorporated crumb rubber content in the mechanical behavior of dense <b>graded</b> mixes (<b>grade</b> <b>envelope</b> C of Brazilian specification DNER-ES 313 / 97). For this purpose, laboratory tests were carried out to determine the main properties to be used in numerical analyses of a structure of flexible pavement executed with that type of asphalt mixture. The mechanical properties of asphalt hot mixes used in the numerical analysis were determined by laboratory tests (stiffness modulus and fatigue life). The studied asphalt hot mixes were produced with a crumb rubber obtained by the milling process at ambient temperature and a straight binder AC 50 / 70 (classification by penetration). The incorporated rubber content varied from 2 % up to 3, 6 % in relation to the mineral aggregate mixture. For the sake of comparison, a conventional asphalt mixture produced with straight binder AC 50 / 70 and an asphalt-rubber hot mix produced by wet process were also studied. The results showed that the asphalt hot mixes modified with crumb rubber by dry process presented a significant improvement in terms of mechanical behavior in relation to conventional asphalt hot mixes, especially in terms of increase of fatigue life, as can be observed in the numerical analysis performed.

40|$|As {{part of this}} {{research}} project, a test stretch with a sub-base with a hydraulic binder of sand (hydraulically bound sand sub-base) was set up. The project aimed to observe the filling behaviour of the base {{as well as its}} characteristics after it had been laid compared to a hydraulically bound gravel base in accordance with ZTVT. The grading curve of the chosen sand lay within <b>grading</b> <b>envelope</b> 'A' as designated by the supplement for hydraulically bound sand sub-base. A blast furnace cement HOZ 35 L was used as a binder. In particular, extended suitability tests were used to investigate the strengths, frost resistance and initial stability of the mixed materials. The material mixture for hydraulically bound sand sub-base requires a higher binder content compared with that for hydraulically bound gravel base, though from a technical point of view, a material can be produced which meets ZTVT requirements. When the hydraulically bound sand sub-base was laid it became clear that compaction with the heavy-duty screed of a road finishing machine at a thickness of 15 cm was generally sufficient to achieve the specified rate of compaction. Owing to different weather conditions during the construction of the test stretch, there were two qualitatively different areas in the hydraulically bound sand sub-base section. The control test section with hydraulically bound gravel base served as a further comparison to these two sections. In light of the deflection measurement results {{on the surface of the}} hydraulically bound base, the hydraulically bound sand sub-base sections show slightly less favourable characteristics. Whether or not this has any effect on long-term behaviour remains to be seen. With a view to the course bonding between the hydraulically bound base and the asphalt road base, a bond could in no way be determined from the material taken from the drilling core. With the help of surveys carried out by the 'Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen' (Federal Highway research Institute) over a longer period of time, during which the deflections as well as the transverse and longitudinal profiles will be measured, the continued behaviour of the test stretch under traffic conditions is to be evaluated.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted under four study phases. Phase 1 involved a full scale laboratory study to evaluate three different underdrain pipe and envelope systems. It was found that an open <b>graded</b> FA- 4 <b>envelope</b> material without a geotextile wrapped pipe was a viable design option. In Phase 2 a {{study was conducted to}} relate the pipe slot size to the envelope gradation. A testing procedure was developed. A 2 mm pipe slot prevented FA- 4 envelope material from passing into the pipe. In Phase 3 it was found that a modified FA- 4 material with control of the 0. 075 mm aterial could be produced which would have an acceptable saturated hydraulic conductivity value for good subdrainage performance. The study in Phase 4 was inconclusive in terms of selecting geotextiles that would not clog in subdrainage applications. Neither the Gradient Ratio Test nor the Hydraulic Conductivity Ratio Test identified conclusively whether soilgeotextile combinations would clog in the field. 17. Key Word...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed which measures the settling velocity distribution of particles within a complete sewage sample. The development of the test method included observations of particle and liquid interaction using both synthetic media and sewage. Comparison studies with two other currently used settling velocity test procedures was undertaken. The method is suitable for use with either DWF or storm sewage. Information relating to the catchment characteristics of 35 No. wastewater treatment works was collected from the privatised water companies in England and Wales. 29 No. of these sites were used in an experimental programme to determine the settling velocity grading of 33 No. sewage samples. The collected data were analysed {{in an attempt to}} relate the settling velocity distribution to the characteristics of the contributing catchment. Statistical analysis of the catchment data and the measured settling velocity distributions was undertaken. A curve fitting exercise using an S-shaped curve which had the same physical characteristics as the settling velocity distributions was performed. None of these analyses found evidence that the settling velocity distribution of sewage had a significant relationship with the chosen catchment characteristics. The regression equations produced from the statistical analysis cannot be used to assist in the design of separation devices. However, a <b>grading</b> curve <b>envelope</b> was produced, the limits of which were clearly defined for the measured data set. There was no evidence of a relationship between settling velocity grading and the characteristics of the contributing catchment, particularly the catchment area. The present empirical approach to settling tank design cannot be improved upon at present by considering the variation in catchment parameters. This study has provided a basis for future research into the settling velocity measurement and should be of benefit to future workers within this field...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTransitive {{methods were}} {{developed}} to estimate the global in situ resources of an orebody without requiring a random function model. They are very useful when the geometry of the orebody is poorly known, as is demonstrated in the present study. The orebody is a carbonates replacement deposit, whose gold mineralization is strongly linked with igneous intrusives. It comprises two units: the Jasperoid unit in the central part, with the highest gold <b>grades,</b> and the <b>Envelope</b> unit at the periphery. New geostatistical tools show that the transitions from waste to the Envelope and from the Envelope to Jasperoid are sharp in terms of grade. Conversely, in each unit the variogram of gold grade shows a good continuity. In the absence of geological guidelines, modeling the geometry of the various units is the main concern. Transitive methods were put into practice to model the mineralized zone (Envelope + Jasperoid) and the Jasperoid unit alone. Transitive kriging provides {{an estimate of the}} indicator of these units in a grid of blocks. Gold grade was kriged separately for each unit over the same grid as the indicators. The resources of each block are derived from the indicator and grade estimates. The global resources are obtained by summing up the resources of the blocks. In practice, blocks with a too large transitive kriging variance or a too low proportion estimate are discarded, and the resources are parameterized by the corresponding thresholds, giving access to the uncertainty of these resources...|$|R
40|$|The Mt Carlton high-sulphidation Au-Ag-Cu deposit {{is located}} in the {{northern}} Bowen Basin, NE Queensland (Australia). High-grade mineralisation is confined to NE-trending, steeply dipping (75 - 90 °) structures, and is hosted in a rhyodacitic unit of the Lizzie Creek Volcanic Group (Early Permian). The core of the hydrothermal system shows silicic alteration, with variable amounts of alunite (disseminated-and vein-type), anhydrite and pyrite. Outwards, the silicic zone progressively <b>grades</b> into an <b>envelope</b> of quartz- alunite-barite-pyrite → quartz-dickite-kaolinite-pyrite → illite-montmorillonite-pyrite alteration. After the alteration, the majority of metals were deposited in an initial stage of high-sulphidation mineralisation, dominated by enargite-luzonite-pyrite. This stage is overprinted by two intermediate-sulphidation stages, one Zn-Pb-Au rich (sphalerite-galena-electrum) and one Cu-(Au) rich (tennantite), respectively. The known mineralisation along 800 m strike length shows a distinct metal zonation from NE to SW of Cu-Au→ Cu+Zn+Pb+Ag →Ag+Pb →Ag. This metal zonation is mainly linked to the mineralogy of the initial high- sulphidation ore stage. Ar-Ar dating of alunite from the Mt Carlton lithocap gives an age of 284. 3 ± 2. 0 Ma. It is not distinguishable from U-Pb ages of the Lizzie Creek volcanic rocks (283 - 287 ± 2 - 4 Ma), indicating that the mineralisation occurred shortly after the formation of the host rocks. Stable isotope analyses (S, O, H) of sulfates (alunite, anhydrite and barite) and coeval pyrite suggest that they formed from a SO 42 - -dominated fluid with a mixed magmatic-meteoric signature. Thermometric calculations based on S isotope pairs indicate a temperature range of 220 - 130 °C for the hydrothermal alteration stage (alunite-pyrite), and 130 - 115 °C for late, intermediate-sulphidation ore (sphalerite-galena, sphalerite-pyrite). The combined petrographic and isotopic evidence thus suggest that a cooling fluid that evolved from high - to intermediate-sulphidation states was involved in the genesis of the Mt Carlton deposit...|$|R
