5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trip to Sorrento, {{called for}} a {{government}} meeting {{on the night of}} March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E

25|$|Arbutus {{was secured}} {{alongside}} Black Prince, having <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> two-month show the flag cruise around the Pacific Islands. The deployment had seen several incidents, {{the first of}} which occurred while the ship was docked in Tahiti; sailors who were meant to be guarding the ship became drunk, after which a crowd of Tahitians attempted to board the ship and remove equipment. On departure, the corvette sailed into a heavy storm, which lasted for several days. Waves breaking over the bow rendered the bridge unusable, and many aboard—including the ship's cat, for the first and only time in its life—were seasick. Water contamination of the fuel oil taken on in Tahiti damaged the propulsion machinery, further adding to the problems. When Arbutus finally limped into port, the ship's company were informed that they would only remain at Philomel long enough to take on aviation fuel and supplies to be delivered to the Cook Islands.|$|E
500|$|According to his {{recollection}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison wrote much of {{the lyrics}} to [...] "Far East Man" [...] while driving to The Wick to record the song.

500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] was {{watched by}} 3.6 million viewers on initial broadcast, with a 1.4 rating {{in the target}} 18–49 age demographic, tying its {{previous}} season low. The episode lost 100,000 viewers between {{the first half and}} the second. SFScope Fringe reviewer Sarah Stegall noted that the episode's ratings were not surprising, considering the series had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> three-week break. Time shifted viewing led to an increase of 69 percent in the all-important 18-49 demographic, a 2.2 rating share. This was the largest percent increase of the week.|$|E

A month earlier, one security officer at Ministry of Interior was terminated from employment after joining ISIL and calling on other officers to defect.

500|$|On October 23, 1883, an {{interview}} with Hay, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trip to Colorado, appeared {{in the pages of}} the Cleveland Leader. [...] Hay stated that such a novel would be beyond his powers, and that inaccuracies in the depiction of the local scene suggested to him that it was not written by a Clevelander. He offered no candidates who might have written it. Nevertheless, in November, the Leader ran a column speculating that Hay was the author, based on phrases used both in The Bread-Winners and in Hay's earlier book, Castilian Days, and by the fact that one character in the novel was from Salem, Indiana, Hay's birthplace. Further textual analyses led a number of newspapers in early 1884 (when the novel appeared in book form) to state it had been written by Hay.|$|E
500|$|On September 1, 2010, Seattle hosted its {{semifinal}} {{match against}} another MLS club, Chivas USA. [...] Like the quarterfinal, it was hosted at Starfire with a sellout crowd of 4,547.

500|$|Having {{retired from}} rugby league, Lindwall was {{selected}} to make his Ashes and home soil debut in the First Test against England in Brisbane. It was his first Test under the captaincy of Don Bradman, universally regarded as the best batsman in history. Bradman had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> break. Lindwall was a fan of Bradman's leadership, recalling that [...] "he put me at ease straight away" [...] and that [...] "his presence was inspiring for all the team". Lindwall waited for over two days to see action, coming to bat after Australia had reached 7/599. He scored his first runs with 31 as Australia reached 645. He bowled only briefly in the first innings, with 0/23 before being forced from the field with chickenpox, which prevented him from bowling in the second innings as Australia secured a heavy innings victory. The illness prevented Lindwall from playing in the Second Test in Sydney in {{what would have been}} his first Test in his home town.|$|E

500|$|Prince Robot IV: A {{member of}} the royal family of the Robot Kingdom, {{assigned}} by Landfall as their primary pursuer of Alana and Marko {{in the beginning of the}} series when his wife is pregnant with their first child. Like others of his race, he is a humanoid with a small television set for a head, which Vaughan explains is influenced by a fascination with old televisions that he developed when he began writing for TV. He also has blue blood and the ability to morph his right arm into a cannon. In the beginning of the series, Prince Robot IV has <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> [...] "two–year tour of hell" [...] after which he had to be given a new leg following a brutal sneak attack. His brain [...] "reboots" [...] after he is injured confronting the family in the third story arc and he is still missing when his son is born in the fourth story arc.|$|E
500|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, King George V {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. Repeated reports of submarines in Scapa Flow led Jellicoe to conclude that the defences there were inadequate and he ordered that the Grand Fleet be dispersed to other bases until the defences be reinforced. On 16 October the 2nd BS was sent to Loch na Keal on the western coast of Scotland. The squadron departed for gunnery practice off the northern coast of Ireland on the morning of 27 October and her sister [...] struck a mine, laid a few days earlier by the German auxiliary minelayer [...] Thinking that the ship had been torpedoed by a submarine, the other dreadnoughts were ordered away from the area, while smaller ships rendered assistance. In late November 1914, King George V developed problems with her condensers, even though she had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> refit. This forced the ship to be withdrawn from operations while her port condenser had its tubes replaced, which took until 12 December.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{impetus for}} the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration is {{somewhat}} contested {{as it is a}} vague international movement. George von Neumayer of Hamburg, also an Antarctic explorer, worked to renew Antarctic exploration in 1861 onwards as he worked in an observatory in Melbourne. His particular interests were the importance of meteorology and how more information of the South Pole could lead to more accurate weather predictions. This helps explain German involvement in Antarctic research. Another, particularly British, impetus more closely tied to the period [...] is a lecture given by Dr. John Murray entitled [...] "The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration", given to the Royal Geographical Society in London, November 27, 1893. Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to [...] "resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south". Furthermore, the Royal Geographic Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully incited many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and foregrounded the lecture given by Murray. In August 1895 the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration [...] "in whatever ways seem to them most effective". Such work would [...] "bring additions to almost every branch of science". The Congress had been addressed by the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink, who had <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> whaling expedition during which he had become {{one of the first to}} set foot on the Antarctic mainland. During his address, Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition, to be based at Cape Adare.|$|E
