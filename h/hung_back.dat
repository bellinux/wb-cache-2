25|$|At {{the end of}} January a 10,000–11,000-man French corps under Marshal Jacques MacDonald {{approached}} from the north. Supposing that Schwarzenberg's maneuvers would draw Napoleon away from his Army of Silesia, Blücher focused on destroying MacDonald's corps. During {{the first week of}} February, the Prussian field marshal ordered Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's corps to pursue MacDonald along the main highway in the Marne River valley. Hoping to trap the French corps, Blücher sent Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's corps along the more direct road through Montmirail and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. Trying to accomplish two strategic goals at once, the Prussian army commander <b>hung</b> <b>back</b> to allow the newly arrived corps of Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich and Friedrich von Kleist to catch up with him. Blücher utilized Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev's small corps to link the two parts of his army.|$|E
500|$|For {{his first}} start on July 4, 1972 at Aqueduct Racetrack, Secretariat was made the lukewarm {{favorite}} at 3–1. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut {{in front of the}} field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he would have fallen if he hadn't been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position {{at the top of the}} stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only [...] lengths. In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat <b>hung</b> <b>back</b> at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.|$|E
500|$|Wyatt Earp drew {{a sketch}} in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15, 1926 that {{depicted}} Billy Clanton {{near the middle}} of the lot, close to the Harwood house. Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot. Frank was in the center between the two buildings, holding the reins of his horse. Tom was closer to C. S. Fly's boarding house. According to Wyatt's sketches, Morgan was on the right of the lawmen, close to the Harwood house, opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot, opposite Frank and Ike Clanton. Wyatt was to Virgil's left, opposite Tom. [...] Doc Holliday <b>hung</b> <b>back</b> a step or two on Fremont Street. [...] Neither of Wyatt's sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Clairborne, who ran from the fight.|$|E

500|$|Around 5:00 pm {{the wind}} began to shift, to British disadvantage. De Grasse gave signals for the van to move further ahead {{so that more}} of the French fleet might engage, but Bougainville, fully engaged with the British van at musket range, {{did not want to}} risk [...] "severe {{handling}} had the French presented the stern." [...] When he did finally begin pulling away, British leaders interpreted it as a retreat: [...] "the French van suffered most, because it was obliged to bear away." [...] Rather than follow, the British <b>hung</b> <b>back,</b> continuing to fire at long range; this prompted one French officer to write that the British [...] "only engaged from far off and simply {{in order to be able}} to say that they had fought." [...] Sunset brought an end to the firefight, with both fleets continuing on a roughly southeast tack, away from the bay.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the region}} around Medina, the Islamic capital, was recaptured, Khalid entered Nejd, a stronghold of the Banu Tamim tribes. Many of the clans hastened to visit Khalid and {{submit to the}} rule of the Caliphate. But the Banu Yarbu' tribe, under Sheikh Malik ibn Nuwayrah, <b>hung</b> <b>back.</b> Malik avoided direct contact with Khalid's army and ordered his {{followers}} to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert. He also collected taxes and sent his men to Medina to deliver them. Nevertheless, Malik was accused of rebelling against the state of Medina and charged for entering into an anti-Caliphate alliance with Sajjah, a self-proclaimed prophetess. Malik was arrested along with his clansmen, and asked by Khalid about his crimes. Upon hearing Malik's response: [...] "your master said this, your master said that" [...] referring to Abu Bakr, Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans tried {{twice to}} bluff Gambier-Parry into {{surrender}} {{but he had}} received orders from CYRCOM to break out and retreat to El Adem and decided to attack at dawn, to gain a measure of surprise. On 8 April, A Squadron of the 18th Cavalry broke through {{and then turned to}} attack Italian artillery, as some Indian troops of the 11th Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) got away. Most of the garrison was pinned down but during a second attempt at [...] small parties of the 2nd Royal Lancers escaped. The garrison had fired most of its small-arms ammunition at the vision slits of the German tanks, which had <b>hung</b> <b>back</b> in fear of mines and when Italian infantry attacked, had little ammunition left. Gambier-Parry and [...] Indian and Australian troops surrendered to Major-General Pietro Zaglio, commander of the Pavia Division.|$|E
2500|$|Boyar shirts were of silk, {{embroidered}} with gold thread {{and decorated with}} pearls.

2500|$|She {{was placed}} under the {{temporary}} command of Commander Thomas Boys immediately after her capture, after which Captain Sir John Gore was placed in command. Censeur, jury-rigged and armed en flûte was then sent back to England with a convoy under Commodore Thomas Taylor. It consisted of 63 merchants of the Levant convoy, the 74-gun ships [...] under Taylor, and [...] under Captain Augustus Montgomery, the 44-gun [...] under Captain Richard Randall Burgess, the 32-gun frigates , Captain Lord Amelius Beauclerk, HMS Lutine, Captain William Haggit, and the fireship , Captain Joseph Turner. The convoy called at Gibraltar on 25 September, at which point thirty-two of the merchants left that night in company with Argo and Juno. The rest of the fleet sailed together, reaching Cape St Vincent by the early morning of 7 October. At this point a sizeable French squadron was sighted bearing up, consisting of six ships {{of the line and}} three frigates under Rear-Admiral Joseph de Richery. The British ships of the line formed a defensive line, but as they were doing so Censeurs jury-rigged foretopmast carried away, and only having been fitted with a frigate's mainmast, she was obliged to fall behind. Fortitude and Bedford <b>hung</b> <b>back</b> to support her, and resisted the French attack for an hour, during which Censeurs remaining top masts were shot away and she exhausted her supply of powder. Gore surrendered his ship, and the remaining British warships and one surviving merchant of the convoy made their escape.|$|E

50|$|MAFAC sold {{tool kits}} for general repair while riding, but the kits {{specifically}} included {{all of the}} tools to work on MAFAC brakes. They were sold in a plastic folder-type bag which could be <b>hung</b> from the <b>back</b> of bicycle saddles.|$|R

60|$|She came {{to light}} much younger than Stacey thought her. She was not eighteen, but her supple and splendid figure was fully matured. Her hair <b>hung</b> down her <b>back</b> in a braid, which gave a {{distinct}} touch of childishness to her.|$|R
60|$|Sitting in {{the shade}} of the poop, they opened the box, which was filled with fine dull-yellow grains. Then Lister sent a man to the boat for some things he had brought, and when the fellow came <b>back</b> <b>hung</b> a small steel cup from a spring-balance.|$|R

6000|$|As thus {{he walked}} down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming, {{trolling}} a merry song as he drew nigh. On his <b>back</b> <b>hung</b> his bag and his hammer, and in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long, and thus sang he: ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then his}} eye, {{wandering}} aside, {{collided with the}} following objects: a fluffy pink dressing-gown, <b>hung</b> over the <b>back</b> of a chair, an entirely strange suit-case, and, on the bureau, a photograph in a silver frame of a stout gentleman in evening-dress whom {{he had never seen}} before in his life.|$|R
6000|$|His mind <b>hung</b> at that. <b>Back</b> {{upon his}} {{consciousness}} came crowding the horrors and desolations {{that had been}} his daily food now for {{three quarters of a}} year.

5000|$|His horrified father {{turned him}} out of house, so the boy set out {{to learn how to}} shudder. He complained {{whenever}} he could, [...] "If only I could shudder!" [...] One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging. He did so, and set a fire for the night. When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, <b>hung</b> them <b>back</b> up in the gallows.|$|R
25|$|Having {{thoroughly}} {{checked the}} surrounding area, the officer in command, Captain D.H. Galatti, began cutting down {{the body of}} Clifford Martin using a knife fastened to a pole.
