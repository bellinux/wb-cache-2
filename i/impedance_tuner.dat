After presenting the proposed tuner principle, a demonstrator based on a 3. 5 mm coaxial line and designed to operate at microwave frequencies from 2 to 18 GHz is introduced. Then, its performances are measured and compared to simulation results. Finally, overall performances are compared to other currently commercialized <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> technologies. Depending on the targeted frequency band, different slugs {{can be used to}} obtain an optimal VSWR. Slugs typically offers a 200 : 1 VSWR.

40|$|This work {{contributes}} to two fields {{of research at}} millimeter wavelengths: waveguide <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> and Schottky diodes. Three novel impedance tuning devices for frequencies between 75 - 220 GHz are presented and new modeling and characterization methods applicable to millimeter-wave and THz Schottky diodes are introduced. In addition, the use of waveguide <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> and Schottky diodes is demonstrated in three different applications. Waveguide tuners are used for dielectric material characterization at 75 - 110 GHz and in a fundamental frequency mixer diode test platform at 183 GHz. Schottky diodes characterized in this work are used in a novel MMIC frequency tripler for 75 - 140 GHz and in the aforementioned 183 GHz mixer diode test platform. Waveguide <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> are widely used {{in a variety of}} applications at millimeter wavelengths, ranging from device matching to load-pull and noise parameter measurements. The three <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> presented in this work are a multiwaveguide-band backshort, waveguide EH-tuner for 140 - 220 GHz, and a double-stub E-plane tuner for 75 - 110 GHz. All <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> are based on the dielectric backshort concept, which offers resonance-free operation, low losses, and tuning with higher resolution than is possible with traditional backshorts. For example, at the center frequency of the W-band, 92 GHz, the VSWR of the multiwaveguide-band backshort is larger than 165 for all positions of the backshort and the phase resolution {{as a function of the}} backshort movement is 0. 0825 (deg) / 10 micrometers, which is 10 times more accurate than with a traditional backshort. The Schottky diode is the workhorse in almost all room temperature mixer and frequency multiplier applications at 100 - 3000 GHz. Design of Schottky-based circuits at these frequencies relies on accurate models for the Schottky diode. In this work, a novel method is presented for simultaneous extraction of Schottky diode series resistance and thermal resistance. The method avoids the inaccuracies inherent in the traditional I-V extraction methods caused by the self-heating of the diode, which can result in too small a value for the extracted series resistance. In addition, a quantitative comparison of low-frequency (1 MHz) and microwave frequency (3 - 10 GHz) capacitance determination techniques is performed for millimeter-wave and THz Schottky diodes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{wireless}} market, users {{have a high}} level of expectations regarding the functionalities and services added to their wireless mobile devices. At the same time, they also expect performance to remain optimal. In order to meet users’ heightened expectations, the level of integration between different subsystems of wireless radios must increase exponentially {{to keep pace with the}} increased demand of functionalities. For example, the current size limitations for mobile wireless devices allow space for only a single antenna, but this antenna must cover dual frequency bands, the first extending from 800 MHz to 960 MHz and the second from 1710 MHz to 2300 MHz. Extending the antenna bandwidth to cover the lower edge of the spectrum without increasing the physical size of the antenna is a challenging task. Meanwhile, there is also a demand to decrease antenna size to achieve more compact wireless mobile devices and to free up space for newly added features. One means to achieve these contradicting requirements is to use <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners</b> to enable a small-sized antenna to cover wider range of frequencies. In this thesis, we investigate some methods of applying <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners.</b> First, we conduct a comprehensive study on the tuning range of multiple network topologies, after which we present a design method to substitute impractical and expensive variable inductors with practical and relatively inexpensive fixed inductors connected to variable capacitors. These serve as building blocks for <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners.</b> This is followed by a performance investigation of a readily available tunable capacitor. The equivalent circuit is extracted at different bias voltages and across the frequency range of interest. This circuit model is used in the fourth part of this thesis as an input to the simulator. Next, we conduct multiple simulation runs to demonstrate the major differences between two methods of impedance tuning: a tunable matching network and an aperture-based antenna tuning. The simulation results demonstrate the performance limitations of each technique. Finally, we verify the study findings by measurements in an anechoic RF chamber, discovering that the conducted measurements conform to the obtained simulation results...|$|R

The adaptive power supply is a noninverting buck–boost power converter. It is shown that precise output voltage positioning and low output voltage ripple over a wide output voltage range, including buck, boost, and buck/boost transition modes, can be accomplished using Σ–Δ modulation in combination with a small, low-resolution DPWM core. A two-mode digital controller is presented, in which the compensator parameters are changed upon buck/boost mode transitions in order to improve closed-loop dynamic performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} research on several different projects. The first project is a via-less CPW RF probe pad to microstrip transition; The second, the third, and the fourth one are reconfigurable microwave circuits using RF MEMS switches: an X-band reconfigurable bandstop filter for wireless RF frontends, an X-band reconfigurable <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> for a class-E high efficiency power amplifier using RF MEMS switches, and a reconfigurable self-similar antenna using RF MEMS switches. The first project was developed {{in order to facilitate}} the on-wafer measurement for the second and the third project, since both of them are microstrip transmission line based microwave circuits. A thorough study of the via-less CPW RF probe pad to microstrip transition on silicon substrates was performed and general design rules are derived to provide design guidelines. This research work is then expanded to W-band via-less transition up to 110 GHz. The second project is to develop a low power reconfigurable monolithic bandstop filter operating at 8, 10, 13, and 15 GHz with cantilever beam capacitive MEMS switches. The filter contains microstrip lines and radial stubs that provide different reactances at different frequencies. By electrically actuating different MEMS switches, the different reactances from different radial stubs connecting to these switches will be selected, thus, the filter will resonate at different frequencies. The third project is to develop a monolithic reconfigurable <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> at 10 GHz with the cantilever DC contact MEMS switch. The <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> is a two port network based on a 3 bit- 3 bit digital design, and uses 6 radial shunt stubs that can be selected via integrated DC contact MEMS switches. By selecting different states of the switches, there will be a total of 2 ^ 6 = 64 states, which means 64 different impedances will be generated at the output port of the tuner. This will provide a sufficient tuning range for the output port of the power amplifier to maximize the power efficiency. The last project is to integrate the DC contact RF MEMS switches with self-similar planar antennas, to provide a reconfigurable antenna system that radiates with similar patterns over a wide range of frequencies.

40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{switches}} {{are widely}} used in electrical systems, telecommunications, and wireless applications. In RF systems, it is often desirable to change the signal path effectively, by us-ing couplers, duplexers, and RF switches for signal division and combining. Typically, in modern RF systems, the RF switch is mostly capitalized {{in order to reduce}} the RF footprint but with efficient switch characteristics. A simple method to reduce transceiver space requirement is to integrate RF switches with the frontend module on a single chip. Recent advances in Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology allows RF designers to design faster, smaller, and efficient components using this technology. With high data rates in demand for wireless communication systems, wideband characteristics are needed in modern systems [1]. Therefore, it is desirable to design wideband circuits; such as, mixers, amplifiers, and switches. In this work, a comprehensive study of NRC GaN 150 HEMT is conducted to design broadband RF switches. Single pole and double pole switch topologies operating at 1 - 12 GHz are designed to evaluate GaN 0. 15 μm RF switches. The main objectives were to design compact sized switches, while having high power handling, low insertion loss, high isolation and high return loss. Additionally, a transmit-receive switch is designed for integration into a frontend module and further fabricated to operate at 10 GHz. There are many applications of RF switches in an RF transceiver, one of which is an <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner.</b> <b>Impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> are attractive for many applications where mobile devices are used for wireless communications. As mobile technology continues to evolve, they are designed to be com-pact, leaving minimal space for the antenna. Consequently, the radiating element is often electrically small and sensitive to near-field coupling requiring tuning. Matching networks aim to tune matching conditions; for example, loading effects due to human hand [2]. For such situations, specialized matching networks can be designed to account for specific loading environmental effects. However, for mobile systems, the environment is unknown; thereby, yielding unpredictable antenna loading, especially for electrically small antennas that have rapidly changing real and imaginary impedance. As a result, it is necessary to design a reconfigurable impedance-matching network to account for possible load impedances. In this work, a 16 -bit reconfigurable <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner</b> design comprising of passive microwave components and NRC GaN 0. 15 μm FET operating at X-band is presented to evaluate its performance for integration with the frontend module on a single chip to reduce cost and increase efficiency of the system...|$|E

40|$|Tunability, reconfigurability, and {{adaptability}} for RF {{and microwave}} circuits are highly desirable because {{they not only}} enhance the functionality and performance but also reduce the circuit size and cost. This thesis studies impedance matching circuits that adapt themselves based on either transmit power level or operating environment, targeting the realization of high performance intelligent RF front-ends. Specifically, this study {{is divided into two}} distinct topics: (a) linear and efficient power amplifiers (PAs) using tunable matching networks (TMNs) that are dynamically controlled according to the instantaneous power level, and (b) adaptive matching systems based on impedance tuning units to automatically compensate the impedance variation of an antenna. The tuning elements used for implementing the adaptive impedance matching circuits include both semiconductor and ferroelectric varactors. To use the intrinsically nonlinear ferroelectric materials in wireless transceivers with stringent linearity requirements, a technique for improving the linearity of the ferroelectric varactors is proposed and implemented. Up to 16 dB improvement on IIP 3 is demonstrated. A study of the tradeoff between the quality factor and tuning speed for the linearized varactors is conducted. Subsequently, two specific applications are investigated. First, a PA with a diode-based TMN is designed, fabricated, and tested. The TMN is dynamically controlled according to the instantaneous power level such that not only optimum load is provided but the AM-AM and AM-PM distortions of the PA are reduced, for the first time demonstrating both efficiency enhancement and linearity improvement using TMNs. Measurement results show that a 13 % reduction in DC power consumption is achieved under the same linearity constraint. Second, a closed-loop system is proposed for adaptively performing impedance matching to an unknown load. The adaptive matching system is composed of an <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner,</b> an impedance sensor, and peripheral control circuitries. The <b>impedance</b> <b>tuner,</b> consisting of a phase shifter and a variable transformer, is a novel implementation using an all-pass network topology.

50|$|Matching the {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} to {{the impedance of}} the feed line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna <b>tuner,</b> an <b>impedance</b> matching device. Installing the tuner between the feed line and the antenna allows for the feed line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point <b>impedance.</b> Installing a <b>tuner</b> in between the transmitter and the feed line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the feed line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the feed line still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased feed line losses unmitigated.|$|R
50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, several subtle prerequisites {{are necessary for}} operation. The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as {{the strength of the}} field generated by the radio frequency excitation coil, allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron. Also, the <b>impedance</b> of the <b>tuner</b> that supplies the radio signal must be low to match the low impedance of the excitation coil, requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the telephone earphone must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms. The iron band moves a few millimeters per second.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a comprehensive approach}} to the characterization and modelling of large-signal nonlinear RF/microwave devices, circuits and systems. This research is moti- vated by the increased linearity and power-efficiency requirements of modern power ampli- fier technology for wireless communications. For instance, maximizing the power amplifier’s efficiency can only be achieved by operating RF transistors under strong nonlinear condi- tions, however this is contradictory to maximizing PA linearity. Simultaneously designing for efficiency and linearity is a challenging trade-off in today’s fragmented design process, therefore the advancement of computer-aided design (CAD) tools is essential for achieving an optimal solution. The successful and effective CAD tool based PA design relies {{on the availability of}} accurate nonlinear models to mimic the electro-thermal behaviour of RF transistors. The accuracy of these models depends on three factors: 1. The formulation of the model. 2. The model extraction procedure. 3. The accuracy of the measurement data. While prior work focuses separately on the improved model formulations or improving characterization accuracy, this thesis {{provides a}} comprehensive analysis of all three factors. This thesis proposes a modular large-signal RF device characterization system, and a non- linear behavioral model capable of handling strongly nonlinear unmatched RF transistors, each necessary to streamline the design process and achieve a first-pass PA design. iii As a first step, a large-signal characterization system has been developed to measure the multi-harmonic frequency response of RF transistors and has the ability to i) Perform high-power measurements, ii) Characterize unmatched transistors, iii) Operate the DUT under any possible operating condition, iv) Synthesize any multi-harmonic stimulus, and v) Reconstruct the time-domain I/V waveforms at the ports of the DUT. The proposed characterization system eliminates fragmentation between measurement and simulation environments by providing seamless integration with Harmonic Balance simulations. This provides a common framework that integrates all steps of the PA design process from device-level characterization, to circuit-level measurement and validation. This system is implemented using modular instruments consisting of mixer-based receivers, arbitrary waveform generators, <b>impedance</b> <b>tuners,</b> and a multi-harmonic phase-coherent reference source. It also integrates sequential calibration routines to provide receiver, port match, and source-power corrections to the DUT measurement plane and measurement routines for automated data collection. The second part of the thesis researches black-box frequency-domain behavioral mod- els that can approximate strongly nonlinear, unmatched devices. Our investigation yielded two complimentary solutions to ensure the targeted modelling accuracy. First, improving the accuracy of a first-order expansion-based Poly-Harmonic Distortion (PHD) model by 5 dB, in terms of Normalized Mean-Squared Error (NMSE), by minimizing multi-harmonic reflections that artificially increase the order of the nonlinear system. While this addresses the fictitious need for higher-order models due to the deficiencies in the model extraction procedure, strongly nonlinear devices will require high-order models to achieve the targeted accuracy over a larger measurement distribution. Hence, a variable order Multi-Harmonic Volterra (MHV) model is proposed to extend the PHD model formulation to strong non- linear devices. This model is extracted by utilizing the proposed characterization system to extract higher-order multi-variate model coefficients not included in the PHD model. The resulting model improves DC drain current prediction by 5 dB and improves funda- mental output-power prediction by 2 dB. The MHV model improves the vector power-gain prediction by 3. 4 dB in realistic PA design applications, thereby providing better emulation of linearization techniques within a simulation environment. Finally, a concurrent dual-band PA design is studied {{as an example of how}} the pro- iv posed nonlinear characterization system and behavioural modelling approach can be used to enable complex PA designs. First, a 10 W Class-AB PA is designed using dual-band matching-network theory, however it is difficult to implement because the design technique does not control the matching fractional bandwidth as a design parameter. Therefore, an alternative Class-J 45 W dual-band PA was designed using a low-impedance matching network, combined with a trans-impedance dual-band filter. Although the dual-band PA can achieve comparable performance to an equivalent single-band PA at each separate fre- quency, further development of characterization, modeling, and circuit design techniques is needed to achieve high-efficiency during concurrent operation...|$|R
