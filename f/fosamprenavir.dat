50|$|Over 100 single gene point {{mutations}} {{have been}} described, of {{which at least}} 26 are specific to protease inhibitors. Of these, there are about 15 primary or major mutations that are significant enough to change drug activity.Many mutated residues {{have been found in}} HIV-1 protease which cause drug resistance, for example Leu33 changes to Ile, Val, or Phe; Val82 to Ala, Phe, Leu, or Thr; Ile84 to Val; and Leu90 to Met. Different mutations affects different protease inhibitors. For instance, mutations at Leu90 evidently affect saquinavir and nelfinavir while indinavir activity is affected by mutations at Met46, Val82, and Ile84, and <b>fosamprenavir</b> is affected when Ile50 changes to Val and at Ile84. A combination of mutations can render high-level drug resistance but single mutations normally do not equate with drug resistance to protease inhibitors.The mutations can be divided into primary mutations and secondary mutations. Primary mutations often have only a small effect on resistance. The chemical structures of most protease inhibitors are quite similar, so {{it is not surprising that}} some primary mutations lead simultaneously to resistance to multiple protease inhibitors. Cross-resistance is one of the major problems of protease inhibitor treatment. Additional mutations emerging in the protease during continuous protease inhibitor therapy are commonly referred to as secondary mutations.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{feasibility}} of linking the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug with its gastrointestinal behavior by simultaneous monitoring of plasma and intraluminal drug concentrations. <b>Fosamprenavir,</b> a phosphate ester prodrug of the poorly water-soluble HIV-inhibitor amprenavir, was selected as model compound. Methods. A single tablet of <b>fosamprenavir</b> (Telzir®) was administered to 5 volunteers in the fasted and fed state (simulated by intake of a nutritional drink). Gastric and duodenal fluids were aspirated in function of time and characterized with respect to the concentration of (fos) amprenavir, inorganic phosphate and pH. In parallel, blood samples were collected and analyzed for amprenavir. Results. The observed plasma concentration-time profiles suggested a food-induced delay in the absorption of amprenavir: in the fed state, mean tmax increased by more than 150 min compared to the fasted state. A similar delay was seen in the duodenal appearance of <b>fosamprenavir</b> (concentrations in mM-range) and, after dephosphorylation, amprenavir (concentrations below 160 µM). This observation could be related to the behavior of <b>fosamprenavir</b> in the stomach.

40|$|Purpose. To {{simultaneously}} monitor gastrointestinal and plasma {{concentrations of}} (fos) amprenavir in man after {{administration of the}} phosphate ester prodrug <b>fosamprenavir</b> in the fasted and fed state. Methods. A single tablet of <b>fosamprenavir</b> (TelzirⓇ) was administered to 5 volunteers in the fasted and fed state (crossover design). The fed state was simulated by intake of a nutritional drink (Scandishake MixⓇ), 20 min prior to drug administration. Gastric and duodenal fluids were aspirated in function of time and characterized with respect to pH and the concentration of (fos) amprenavir. In parallel, blood samples were collected and analyzed for amprenavir. Results. The observed plasma concentration-time profiles suggest a food-induced delay in the absorption of amprenavir: tmax increased from 82 ± 43 min in the fasted state to 240 ± 60 min in the fed state. A similar increase in tmax {{was seen in the}} duodenum for <b>fosamprenavir</b> (from 53 ± 29 to 165 ± 44 min) and, after dephosphorylation, amprenavir (from 66 ± 25 to 214 ± 41 min).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrated}} {{the value of}} two advanced tools, the TNO gastric and small Intestinal Model (TIM- 1) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for the in vitro evaluation of food-dependent disintegration of immediate release <b>fosamprenavir</b> tablets. Upon introduction of a tablet with the nutritional drink Scandishake Mix® in the stomach compartment of TIM- 1, simulating the fed state, disintegration and <b>fosamprenavir</b> dissolution were significantly postponed compared to the fasted state (lag time 80 ± 23 min). This resulted in a lag in the appearance of bioaccessible <b>fosamprenavir</b> (< 5 % during the first 2 h), even though the nutritional state did not significantly alter the cumulative bioaccessibility after 5 h. These results were {{in agreement with the}} previously observed postprandial delay in gastric <b>fosamprenavir</b> tablet disintegration and subsequent amprenavir absorption in healthy volunteers. Therefore, TIM- 1 can be used in tablet development to identify food-induced disintegration issues causing unexpected clinical behavior. From a mechanistic perspective, we applied MRI to illustrate impaired water ingress in <b>fosamprenavir</b> tablets immersed in the nutritional drink compared to simulated gastric fluid. This effect may be attributed to both competition between nutritional components and the tablet for the available water (indicated by reduced rotational and translational diffusion) as well as the possible formation of a food-dependent precipitation layer on the HPMC-coated tablet. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|As {{a result}} of their {{improved}} aqueous solubility, the development of phosphate ester prodrugs is an interesting approach to increase intestinal absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Absorption of a drug from its phosphate ester prodrug is based on intestinal dephosphorylation of the prodrug which may result in intraluminal supersaturation of the parent drug, followed by an increased absorptive flux across the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the behavior of <b>fosamprenavir,</b> a phosphate ester prodrug of amprenavir, in the Caco- 2 system and in aspirated human intestinal fluids (HIF), both showing phosphatase activity. Starting from a solution of <b>fosamprenavir</b> in HIF, a supersaturated solution of amprenavir was generated and maintained during a time period sufficient for absorption. Moreover, supersaturation of amprenavir resulted in an enhanced flux across Caco- 2 monolayers. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration of supersaturation in real intestinal media. Next, we showed an inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on the dephosphorylation of <b>fosamprenavir,</b> both in the Caco- 2 model and in HIF. As a consequence, phosphate-buffered media, including fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF), are incompatible with the study of phosphate ester prodrugs and should be replaced with media containing a biorelevant phosphate concentration (0. 4 - 1 mM) and another buffering compound such as 2 -morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES). status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the prevalence and predictors of genotypic resistance of HIV- 1 to lopinavir and <b>fosamprenavir</b> from patients failing protease inhibitors (PI) -based regimens. We selected 643 HIV- 1 -infected patients with available treatment history who underwent genotypic resistance assays for virological failure from a clinical site and from the Stanford database. According to the genotypic resistance interpretation of the Stanford algorithm, proportions of viruses showing full susceptibility to <b>fosamprenavir</b> and lopinavir were 32 % and 34 %, respectively (p =ns). Proportions of viruses fully susceptible to lopinavir/r and fosamprenavir/r according to the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche sur le SIDA (ANRS) algorithm, were 81 % and 81 %, respectively. According to the Rega algorithm, proportions of viruses showing full susceptibility to fosamprenavir/r and lopinavir were 80 % and 70 %, respectively (p< 0. 001). According to the ANRS and Rega interpretations, the time on therapy predicted susceptibility to lopinavir/r, while susceptibility to fosamprenavir/r according to ANRS was predicted by the number of prior PI regimens experienced. According to the Stanford interpretation, prior indinavir exposure predicted resistance to lopinavir/r and fosamprenavir/r while prior nelfinavir use predicted susceptibility to both drugs. After failing PI-based regimens, the majority of viruses retained a predicted susceptibility to fosamprenavir/r and lopinavir/r.

40|$|Abstract Background Liver {{disease is}} the second cause of death among HIV {{patients}} receiving {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) in Europe. HIV patients have a high prevalence of chronic HBV (6 – 10 %) and HCV (33 %) co-infection, and accelerated progression of viral hepatitis. Furthermore, the long duration of both HIV and HCV diseases in the HAART era increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Findings We report the case of a 49 [*]year -old HIV/HCV co-infected male patient who developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent a partial hepatectomy, and a few months later was treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation due to hepatocarcinoma recurrence. Two months later, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed and sorafenib therapy was initiated. The patient achieved partial response of the main lesions, complete regression of the smallest lesions and did not experience clinical progression during the 20 -month follow-up period. During therapy with sorafenib, the patient was treated with HAART with good viral and immunological responses. We used the therapeutic drug monitoring to assess antiretroviral concentrations during co-administration of sorafenib. <b>Fosamprenavir</b> C trough was found under the minimum level recommended by international guidelines. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed. At month 20 of treatment, new liver lesions with portal vein thrombosis were diagnosed.

Conclusions Sorafenib monotherapy demonstrated a marked delay in HCC disease progression in an HIV/HCV co-infected patient. <b>Fosamprenavir</b> C trough was found under the minimum level recommended by international guidelines, suggesting a possible interaction. </p...|$|E
