Another famous Serbian vampire legend recounts the story of a certain Sava Savanović, who lives in a watermill and kills and drinks blood from the millers. The character was later used in a story written by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić and in the Yugoslav 1973 horror film Leptirica inspired by the story.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, which were the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood. In the second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while <b>haying.</b> After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also some}} {{evidence}} that road-killed birds and animals are also consumed both on the wintering grounds and on the breeding grounds. The species commonly follows tractors and other agricultural equipment during <b>haying</b> or ploughing, where rodents are exposed for the hawks to capture, or insects are uncovered after crop cutting. Wildfires often attract foraging Swainson's hawks, especially grass fires in their South American wintering range. In South American grass fires, the hawks frequently wait {{around the edges of}} the fire, picking off not only insects but also vertebrates including nothuras, lizards and snakes.|$|E
25|$|A baler is a {{piece of}} farm {{machinery}} used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of <b>haying</b> into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls {{homestead}} in South Dakota {{on a hot}} September day in 1880 as Laura and her father ("Pa") are <b>haying.</b> Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter {{is going to be}} hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.|$|E

During the intake trial, lambs ate similar amounts of AM, AM <b>hay</b> with added starch and sugar (AMSS), and PM <b>hay.</b> After the intake trial, a final preference trial determined that prolonged exposure to AMSS <b>hay</b> increased preference for AMSS <b>hay</b> compared with AM <b>hay.</b> Our results indicate that preference for PM <b>hay</b> is likely related to increased levels of sugars, such as glucose and sucrose, and that lambs learn about the post-ingestive benefits of exogenous sugars added to <b>hay...</b>|$|R
