50|$|Until {{the mid-1970s}} the line took another route between the {{stations}} of Gustorf and Bedburg, running through Harff station and <b>Kaster</b> halt. As {{a result of}} the development of the lignite mining works of Rheinischen Braunkohlewerke (Rheinbraun) at Harff, the line was relocated between Gustorf and Bedburg. Between the two stations was Neurath station, which was not a passenger station, but only an operations station, providing a place for trains to pass. Since the completion of the mining {{on the site of the}} old route it has been intended to return the line to the old route through <b>Kaster.</b> This project has not been implemented.|$|E

5000|$|The {{experience}} of invidia, as Robert A. <b>Kaster</b> notes, is invariably an unpleasant one, whether feeling invidia or finding oneself its object. Invidia {{at the thought}} of another's good may be merely begrudging, <b>Kaster</b> observes, or begrudging and covetous at the same time: [...] "I can feel dolor sorrow, heartache" [...] at seeing your good, just because it is your good, period, or I can feel that way because the good is yours and not mine." [...] Such invidia is morally indefensible: compare the Aesop fable [...] "The Dog in the Manger". But by far the most common usage in Latin of invidia occurs in contexts where the sense of justice has been offended, and pain is experienced at the sight of undeserved wealth, prestige or authority, exercised without shame (pudor); this is the close parallel with Greek [...] (νέμεσις) ...|$|E

50|$|The Triepshi tribe derives {{its origin}} from a Slav, {{probably}} a Bosnian slav called Keq Preka who fled {{to what is}} now Piperi territory in Montenegro and settled there either before the Ottoman invasion or around 1520. He had several sons, Lazar Keqi, Ban Keqi, <b>Kaster</b> Keqi, Merkota Keqi, Vas Keqi and Piper Keqi. The second son, Ban Keqi, is considered to be direct ancestral father of the Triepshi tribe, whereas his brother Lazar Keqi was the ancestor father of the Hoti tibe, witch is thus related to Triepshi. Lazar Keqi settled in Trabojna and Ban Keqi settled in Muzheçk and was buried in Nikmarash. Some members of the tribe derived their origins from Ivan Crnojević, and the old families of Delaj claimed they steemed from Herzegovina.|$|E

5000|$|Limnoforming (from Greek: limnee, [...] "lake"; Latin: formo, [...] "to shape", as in shaping, fashioning, molding, modeling) is {{the process}} of {{manipulating}} the physical or chemical properties of a body of water by introducing organisms which facilitate higher level biological activity, thus impacting the overall ecology of a given body of water, and eventually adjacent ecosystems. [...] Limnoforming is a process using living organisms to enhance a habitat's abiotic component, ultimately rendering it more conducive to a higher ecological quality. This could be accomplished by introducing a population of organisms, e.g., invertebrates or microbes, en masse to the substrate of a body of water. These organisms would then physically and/or chemically alter the underwater environment to furnish a more suitable substrate for a wider range of biological activity; the result being an increased ecological function (e.g., in trophic dynamics), and thus a higher quality ecological state. Ultimately, limnoforming aims to accelerate the rate of ecological succession in distressed aquatic systems (e.g., lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan), so as to produce a biologically complex climax community in a comparatively short amount of time. The concept of limnoforming originated from the benthic ecology laboratory of Dr. Jerry L. <b>Kaster,</b> School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Limnoforming was partially inspired by, and is similar in several aspects to, the concept of terraforming. The two concepts' main similarity is that both aim to accelerate the rate of change occurring in a given environment, in terms of its habitability for a given species or for a number of species, and furthermore, the overall function of its ecology. Instead of creating a habitable ecosystem or biosphere from scratch, limnoforming simply aims to amend degradated Earthly aqueous environments less apt to harboring a high quality ecological community into an environment which does support an ecologically flourishing system. Limnoforming differs from traditional habitat rehabilitation or restoration in that limnoforming is driven by an early sere biological succession process that modifies the physical substrate making it better suited for later seres, whereas rehabilitation/restoration is generally driven by targeting a terminal sere that is poorly adapted at re-forming habitat upon which it depends. The initial limnoforming study, in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, uses freshwater oligochaetes to re-consolidate highly fluid gyttja substrate (organic black ooze) found extensively in lower Green Bay. The goal is to modify substrate suitability for the mayfly Hexagenia. Historically, this mayfly was found in abundance but the eutrophication of the bay led to their demise in first half of the 20th century.|$|E

30|$|Anaerobic {{microorganisms}} {{that reduce}} sulfate are either indigenous in deep subsurface reservoirs {{or can be}} introduced into a reservoir during drilling operations or water flooding (Gieg et al. 2011). The latter {{has been found to}} be a source of multiple components including sulfate, carbon sources, and sulfate reducing communities that influence oilfield souring. The extent of microbial souring depends on the water-flooding operations (i.e. seawater injection or produced water re-injection) (Voordouw et al. 2009; Lysnes et al. 2009), salinity (Wilhelms et al. 2001; Stetter et al. 1993), temperature (Voordouw et al. 2009; <b>Kaster</b> et al. 2007), and sources of carbon and other nutrients (Grigoryan et al. 2008).|$|E

The hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanothermobacter marburgensis and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus can easily be mass cultured. They have therefore been used almost exclusively to study the biochemistry of methanogenesis from H 2 and CO 2, and the genomes of these two model organisms have been sequenced. The close relationship of the two organisms is reflected in their genomic architecture and coding potential. Within the 1, 607 protein coding sequences (CDS) in common, we identified approximately 200 CDS required for the synthesis of the enzymes, coenzymes, and prosthetic groups involved in CO 2 reduction to methane and in coupling this process with the phosphorylation of ADP. Approximately 20 additional genes, such as those for the biosynthesis of F 430 and methanofuran and for the posttranslational modifications of the two methyl-coenzyme M reductases, remain to be identified...|$|E
