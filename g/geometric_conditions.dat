50|$|TSIS-CORSIM is a {{microscopic}} traffic simulation software package for signal systems, highway systems, freeway systems, or combined signal, highway and freeway systems. CORSIM (CORridor SIMulation) {{consists of an}} integrated set of two microscopic simulation models that represent the entire traffic environment. NETSIM represents traffic on urban streets. FRESIM represents traffic on highways and freeways. Microscopic simulation models the movements of individual vehicles, which include the influences of <b>geometric</b> <b>conditions,</b> control conditions, and driver behavior. TSIS (Traffic Software Integrated System) is an integrated development environment that enables users to conduct traffic operations analysis. Built using a component architecture, TSIS allows the user to customize the set of included tools, define and manage traffic analysis projects, define traffic networks and create inputs for traffic simulation analysis, execute traffic simulation models, and interpret the results of those models.|$|E

50|$|The {{principles}} and {{components of the}} timing design and evaluation processes {{are based on the}} international state-of-the-art in both the research and practice for intersection control. As a consequence, a knowledgeable user will find many similarities to other international documents. Nevertheless, some individual procedures, especially with respect to saturation flow and evaluation criteria, may differ because they were developed, tested, or adjusted for specific Canadian conditions. Some methods and parameter values are {{a direct result of the}} work on this Edition, but wherever possible, the original references or sources are identified. The Guide allows the evaluation of existing or future intersection control or <b>geometric</b> <b>conditions</b> relative to travel demand. It does not deal directly with broad systems or network issues, such as transportation demand management or congestion management. The results of the procedures included in the Guide, however, can be used as information for the evaluation of the impact of intersection control, or geometric alternatives on system aspects, such as population mobility, accessibility of various destinations or land use strategies. Although safety is an integral part of all traffic considerations, the Guide does not address this broad and complex issue explicitly. It is left to other specialized documents.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, {{even with}} perfect {{detectors}} and ideal <b>geometric</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{the visibility of}} special contrast features, such as the images of single dislocations, can be additionally limited by diffraction effects.A dislocation in a perfect crystal matrix gives rise to contrast only in those regions where the local orientation of the crystal lattice differs from average orientation by more than about the Darwin width of the Bragg reflection used. A quantitative description {{is provided by the}} dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. As a result, and somehow counter-intuitively, the widths of dislocation images become narrower when the associated rocking curves are large. Thus, strong reflections of low diffraction order are particularly appropriate for topographic imaging. They permit topographists to obtain narrow, well-resolved images of dislocations, and to separate single dislocations even when the dislocation density in a material is rather high. In more unfavourable cases (weak, high-order reflections, higher photon energies), dislocation images become broad, diffuse, and overlap for high and medium dislocation densities. Highly ordered, strongly diffracting materials - like minerals or semiconductors - are generally unproblematic, whereas e.g. protein crystals are particularly challenging for topographic imaging.|$|E
