500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep {{me out of the}} NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack in}} 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson congratulated Arsenal {{on their}} win and {{said of the}} game: [...] "It was about {{trying to make sure}} {{everyone}} was fit for Wednesday. I think we have managed to do that. There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in {{that state}} for about 7 years, when I had the {{inspiration}} for the sequel, [...] "The Gardener". Hoping to give Hab, our hero, some hint of faith back, not to mention some much-needed feminine companionship, I devised a story to show what he'd been up to in seven years of self-imposed exile on a remote continent of a planet just begging for life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} he is,' said Thomas Pinch; 'and, saving that I wish him no ill, I don't care. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> John. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> for ever.' ...|$|R
60|$|I found Walkirk still fishing {{near the}} place where <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Returning {{to my own}} cell, I found Xodar {{still sitting}} in the same {{position}} in which <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The sailor murders ended {{only after}} the Akiska ran aground and sank near Atlantic City, his last two {{potential}} victims escaping to parts unknown. Panzram then caught a ship to Africa and landed in Luanda, Portuguese Angola. [...] He later claimed that while there, he raped and killed an 11- or 12-year-old boy. In his confession to this murder, he wrote: [...] "His brains {{were coming out of}} his ears when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> and he will never be any deader." [...] He also claimed that he hired a boat with six rowers, shot the rowers with a German Luger pistol, and threw their bodies to the crocodiles.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{basically}} raised myself," [...] Mayweather says. [...] "My grandmother {{did what}} she could. When she got mad at me I'd go to my mom's house. My life was ups and downs." [...] His father says he knows how much pain his incarceration caused his son, but insists he did the best he could. [...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try to take care of my mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I was going to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came here}} [...] . I leaped {{out of my}} stockade as after a defeat. I ran in the night. The water was black. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> calling {{on the edge of}} black water. [...] . <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{standing}} alone on the beach. I swam [...] . he called out after me [...] . I swam [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no other}} warrant besides my sex and weakness, unless Mr. Griffith's {{knowledge}} that <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> can be so considered." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was truly}} glad to find he had {{remained}} holding on where <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> sensibly enough. He was, however, muttering to himself ominously.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mammy Green--no. Thank God! he {{is alive}} and well; but <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> with some kind friends in London while I came down here." ...|$|R
60|$|Benjamin's news saddened and silenced me. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> to his letter.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} nothing. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> to {{face his}} own remorse in silence.|$|E
60|$|Brain. Your Limberham is nearer {{than you}} imagine: <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> almost {{entering}} at the door.|$|E
60|$|Crying? <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in {{excellent}} spirits, casting glances of the tenderest admiration at Madame Fontaine. Without {{waiting to hear}} more, I ran to the dining-room.|$|R
60|$|Peeping out of {{the window}} at the back, I was unable to see Sam. My adroit move, I took it, had baffled <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> standing.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt that}} <b>I</b> could; and <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{for the nearest}} colorman's.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} and <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{wandering}} on through the wood with his extraordinary cage around him.|$|E
60|$|His little {{eyes looked}} sharply at me; {{but he made}} no reply, and, shaking hands, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|I murmured my thanks, {{and very}} deep and sincere were they. Then, having kissed his hand, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I {{started off}} {{to search for}} the man under the white {{umbrella}}. I went to where I thought <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> but no white umbrella could I find.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} will wait to hear from me, after he reads the letter <b>I</b> <b>left</b> for <b>him</b> at Detroit. He is as down on the Baxters as I am," ...|$|R
60|$|Within an {{hour after}} <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> Waster Lunny walked into the school-house and handed me his snuff-mull, which I {{declined}} politely. It was with this ceremony that we usually opened our conversations.|$|R
60|$|I never {{pretended to}} {{understand}} Private Ortheris; and so I did {{the next best}} thing <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone.|$|E
60|$|Ham. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> at the gate, firm to your interest, To {{admit the}} townsmen {{at their first}} appearance.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him,</b> {{he asked}} me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I would be comfortable.|$|E
60|$|But she was gone. <b>I,</b> too, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> without ceremony, {{to speak}} to Mrs. Manners, who was {{standing}} apart, looking shoreward. She started when I spoke, and I saw that tears were in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brain. I hope not: I thought <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{sure enough}} at the Exchange; but, looking behind me, as I {{entered into the}} house, I saw him walking a round rate this way.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean he {{will not}} do {{it on his own}} responsibility. But he has consented to do it on mine. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> a note over my {{signature}} to the effect that a safe-conduct for Mlle. de Kercadiou to go to Paris and return is issued by him in compliance with orders from me. The powers I carry and of which I have satisfied him are his sufficient justification for obeying me in this. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>him</b> that note on the understanding that he is to use it only in an extreme case, for his own protection. In exchange he has given me this safe-conduct." ...|$|R
60|$|John Ford made a {{movement}} {{as if the}} bottom {{had dropped out of}} his world. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> there.|$|E
60|$|After this he {{fell upon}} his knees, and, having untied the cut rope {{from the window}} bars, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Enough of the African bandit for the present: <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> happy, {{lifted the}} rope and opened a creaky gate.|$|E
60|$|Within {{two years}} after my own father's death my husband's father also died, and, as <b>I</b> thought, <b>left</b> <b>him</b> a {{considerable}} addition to his estate, the whole trade of the brewhouse, which {{was a very good}} one, being now his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's right. And {{tell him}} he's {{to give you}} some of that salve <b>I</b> <b>left</b> with <b>him</b> yesterday. And you'd better get him to rub it in for you. He's got rather cold hands, but you mustn't mind that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because {{he would}} have been killed if <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>him</b> over yonder. They were firing guns and {{shedding}} blood. Does the sight of blood turn you sick, father? I see it does, by your face. That's like me--What are you looking at?' ...|$|R
