It possesses two GAF domains, GAF-A and GAF-B. Sequence homology alignment {{between the}} GAF domains of PDE 2, 5 and 6 suggests that GAF-A is the non-catalytic cGMP binding site of PDE 6. Based on 3 D-modeling of the GAF-A domain of chicken cone PDE 6 with the crystal structure of mouse PDE 2 A GAF-B domain, residues making side-chain contact with cGMP were identified. Mutagenesis of these residues indicated that the overall architecture of the GAF cGMP-binding pocket is largely conserved between PDE 2, 5 and 6. Residues F 123, D 169, T 172, T 176 are critical for the binding of cGMP and their corresponding alanine mutants {{lost the ability to}} bind cGMP completely. Three of the 4 crucial residues map to the H- 4 helical structure of GAF domain. It is speculated that this region is a necessary structure unit for cGMP binding. The GAF-A domain was demonstrated to be the non-catalytic cGMP binding site of PDE 6. In addition, we have characterized the photoreceptor PDEs of chicken retina. Two histone-activated PDE 6 peaks were separated by ion-exchange chromatograph. The first and second peaks were identified as chicken cone and rod photoreceptor PDEs respectively by mass spectrometry. Chicken photoreceptor PDEs have an <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>profile,</b> cGMP-binding and enzyme kinetics similar to the bovine photoreceptor PDEs. Our characterization of chicken photoreceptor PDEs suggests that the cGMP-binding and enzymatic characteristics are well conserved between birds and mammals. Furthermore, the cGMP-binding of chicken cone PDE 6 holo-enzyme was shown to have very similar cGMP-binding kinetics to bacteria expressed individual GAF-A or GAF-A/B domains...|$|E
40|$|Anti-{{oestrogen}}s act via the oestrogen receptor {{whether they}} {{compete with the}} hormone for binding to the receptor and therefore interfere with DNA binding or inhibit transcriptional activity. These receptors exist as a large 85 complex and/or a small 45 form on sucrose density gradients. High performance ion-exchange chromatography has confirmed that the oestrogen and progestin complex is present in various isoforms. Progestin receptor heterogeneity could {{be influenced by the}} presence of oestrogens and anti-oestrogens in the culture media of hormone-dependent neoplastic cells. Cell culture methods offer the opportunity to test effects of specified components in repeated experiments on a homogeneous population of cells. MCF- 7 and T 47 -D human breast cancer cell lines were conditioned to grow in a serum-free environment. There was no difference in cell proliferation rates, nor in their oestrogen or progestin receptor levels when compared to the same cells grown in conventional media. Receptors were present mainly in the large molecular 85 form. Both the MCF- 7 and T 47 -D breast cancer cells showed an increase in proliferation rate with the addition of oestrogen or diethylstilbestrol. There was a corresponding loss of progestin receptor levels and an alteration in the high performance ion-exchange isoforms. Flow cytometry confirmed differences in the S-phase components of the cells following exposure to oestrogens. The proliferation rates of the cell lines as well as their progestin receptor levels decreased when treated with tamoxifen or the hydroxylated tamoxifen. There were marked changes on high performance <b>ion-exchange</b> chromatography <b>profiles.</b> DNA ploidy and S-phase showed signs of toxicity and there was an increase in cellular debris. The MCF- 7 and T 47 -D human breast cancer cell line retained response to antioestrogen saturation. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect three different storage temperatures (6, 23 and 40  °C) on the sterilized processed cheese quality during 24 -month storage. Sterilized processed cheese (SPC) is a product with extended shelf life (up to 2  years). The samples of SPC were subjected to basic chemical analyses, i. e. pH-values, dry matter, fat, crude protein and ammonia content, and microbiological analyses, i. e. total number of microorganisms, number of coliforms, colony forming units of yeasts and/or moulds and spore-forming microorganisms. Furthermore, amino acid content (<b>ion-exchange</b> chromatography), protein <b>profile</b> (SDS-PAGE) and fat globules size (image analysis of microscopic technique) were monitored and sensory analysis (scale test and pair comparative test) was implemented, too. Increasing storage temperature and length evoked decrease of total amino acid content and protein nutrition value, increase of ammonia amount, protein changes, enlargement of fat globule size and deterioration of sensory properties of SPC. All the changes grew expressive with increasing storage temperature and time. © 2014, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).
