5000|$|... 1951: The 1951 {{trucks were}} restyled {{with a single}} bar type grille and a {{headlight}} {{at each end of}} the grille bar. The grille was painted argent (silver) to complement the chrome headlight bezels. During the model year, the grille was painted ivory and the headlight rings argent (silver). The hood got new side spears and a three slot embellishment at the front. The front bumper was redesigned. A V-8 emblem was used on the upper <b>grille</b> <b>support</b> on corresponding trucks. The pickup bed and tailgate were redesigned. The bed used a hardwood floor instead of the previous all metal floor. The rear window was larger. Door panels were also added.|$|E
50|$|The {{verandah}} has a timber {{floor and}} elegant cast-iron <b>grille</b> columns <b>supporting</b> the concave roof. The {{underside of the}} verandah roof is lined with tongue and groove boards. A timber hand rail and modern wrought iron balustrade run between the columns. The main doorway is in {{the centre of the}} northern facade with three sets of French doors to the east and two sets of French doors and a bay window to the west. All the French doors have external shutters.|$|R
25|$|Only {{several hundred}} yards from the site of the Merry Maidens lies a Bronze age burial chamber, Cruk Tregyffian, that was {{discovered}} (and unfortunately damaged) during widening of the adjacent B3315 road. The circular barrow is composed of stone uprights decorated with cupmarks, dry stone walling and four capstones. Although the original decorated stone has been removed to Truro museum to protect it against weathering, a replica now sits in its place. Further east along the B3315 road, and only a mile from Lamorna, lies the Boleigh Fogou, considered {{to be one of the}} best remaining monuments of its kind in Cornwall. Built in the Iron age, the purpose of fogous (derived from the Cornish word for cave) is not known. It has been speculated, however, that they could have been used for food storage or for religious ceremonies. The fogou at Boleigh is extensive and has a large entranceway that leads to a long passage with classic dry stone wall and lintel construction. A low doorway just inside the entrance leads to a much narrower and lower passage that turns ninety degrees left after a few metres. After the turn the passage continues for a metre or two before ending; there is a modern metal <b>support</b> <b>grille</b> set into the roof above this section.|$|R
