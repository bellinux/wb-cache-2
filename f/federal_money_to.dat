5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Congress {{passed the}} Urban Mass Transportation Act, {{promising}} <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund mass transit projects in America's cities via the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA). Three years later, voters approved a $ (worth about $ in current dollars) Transportation Bond Issue, which provided over $ (worth $ today) for New York City projects, including for a 1968 Program for Action. The Second Avenue project, for {{a line from}} 34th Street to the Bronx, was given top priority. The City secured a $25 million UMTA grant for initial construction. On March 19, 1970, the Board of Estimate approved Route 132-C, which was {{the portion of the}} line south of 34th Street. Mayor John Lindsay, on August 16, 1970, announced the approval of a $11.6 million design contract for the line, which was awarded to DeLeuw, Cather & Company. Second Avenue was chosen for a subway line over First Avenue because it was closer to places of employment than First Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Among his {{specific}} accomplishments, Cunningham {{engineered the}} construction of a parking deck at Main and North streets, which {{led to the development of}} Liberty Center, a $13 million commercial and office complex in a once-vacant at Broad and Main streets. Additionally, he leveraged $1 million in <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> open a previously-failed Broad Street pedestrian mall, which had stalled on the east end of the city's Broad Street. The street was opened in 2012 and vacant storefronts became filled, leading to expanded downtown development in an eight-block commercial corridor. Several Bethlehem structures were redeveloped, including the Radisson Hotel Bethlehem; the historic Union Station, which became medical offices; and the Orr's Department Store, which became the Main Street Commons. His tenure also saw {{the construction of}} the $85 million Moravian Village retirement community; a $20 million Campus Square dormitory and retail complex at Lehigh University; and a $60 million seven-floor expansion to Lehigh Valley Hospital. As his time as mayor came to a close, redevelopment had on the 550-acre Bethlehem Commerce Center industrial park and the 120-acre Bethlehem Works retail, entertainment and residential area.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression wrought {{havoc on}} the U.S. housing market. By 1933, an {{estimated}} 20 to 25% of the nation's outstanding mortgage debt was in default. Fannie Mae was established in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> finance home mortgages {{in an attempt to}} raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. Fannie Mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: {{about a third of the}} nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.|$|E
500|$|The City of San Francisco {{suffered}} a severe earthquake on April 18, 1906. Lane, {{who was living}} in north Berkeley while awaiting Senate confirmation, hurried to the city {{within hours of the}} earthquake to do what he could to help. Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz immediately appointed him to the Committee of Fifty to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire, and plan the rebuilding of the city. According to Lane's friend, writer Will Irwin, Lane did not content himself with committee work, but personally fought the fire, helping to save much of the Western Addition. [...] In late April, the commissioner-designate took the train east to Washington, where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain <b>Federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> help the city's recovery.|$|E

500|$|Federal {{funding for}} medical {{research}} involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and {{the signature of}} President Bill Clinton. Bush {{has said that he}} supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing [...] "lines" [...] of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power {{for the first time in}} his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.|$|E
2500|$|Wyden {{voted for}} the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, which would change federal law to allow <b>federal</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund {{embryonic}} stem-cell research, ending a federal ban. Wyden urged President George W. Bush to sign it, stating that [...] "I {{see no reason why}} embryonic stem-cell research should be treated any differently than other research" [...] in terms of federal grant funding. Bush vetoed the act twice. In 2007, Wyden, with fellow Oregon Senator Gordon Smith, again supported the bill.|$|E
2500|$|The Panic of 1907 was a {{financial}} crisis that almost crippled the American economy.

Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. [...] James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. [...] Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.|$|E
