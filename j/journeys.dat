5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, {{the young}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{and his father}} Leopold Mozart made three Italian <b>journeys.</b> The first, an {{extended}} tour of 15 months, was financed by performances for the nobility and by public concerts, and took in the most important Italian cities. The second and third <b>journeys</b> were to Milan, for Wolfgang to complete operas that had been commissioned there on the first visit. From the perspective of Wolfgang's musical development the <b>journeys</b> were a considerable success, and his talents were recognised by honours which included a papal knighthood and memberships in leading philharmonic societies.|$|E

5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous <b>Journeys</b> RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous <b>Journeys</b> RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous <b>Journeys</b> was based on D and AD. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous <b>Journeys</b> and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on Dangerous <b>Journeys</b> and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E
