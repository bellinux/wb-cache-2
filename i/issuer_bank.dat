40|$|This study uses {{survey data}} and {{instrumental}} variables' methods {{to assess whether}} in the USA the prices of credit cards (annual percentage rates, APRs) reflect the short- and long-term risks of cardholders (measured as unpaid credit card debt in the previous year, outstanding debt and Fair Issac Corporation score). We find a negative relationship between APRs and long-term risk. This effect is pronounced for sub-prime cardholders. This suggests that higher risk consumers shop around more intensively for credit cards offering the best terms and conditions. However, under stressed economic conditions, <b>issuer</b> <b>banks</b> increase APRs to account for short-term risk. Credit card characteristics, including network affiliation and issuer brand, {{play an important role}} in the pricing decisions of <b>issuer</b> <b>banks.</b> © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the announcement effect of contingent convertible bonds issue made by Asian <b>banks</b> on <b>issuer</b> banks’ share price and CDS spread. Announcement of contingent convertible bonds issuance {{is found to}} have a generally negative impact on issuer banks’ share price. Significant stock price reactions are observed on the second, fourth and tenth day after the announcement is made, indicating some lag in the market response towards the announcement. Furthermore, this study also finds that the design of contingent convertible bonds has significant impact on abnormal stock returns on the announcement day. Positive abnormal stock returns will be reduced if the contingent convertible bonds have large issue size, are classified as Additional Tier 1 capital and have conversion-to-equity provisions. On the other hand, a longer time span between announcement date and issue date is find to have positive correlation with abnormal stock return. Additionally, in contrast to earlier findings, this study finds a generally positive reaction on CDS spread towards the announcement. As previous studies have used global banks’ issuance as sample, this study is the first study on contingent convertible bonds announcement effect that has segregated the issuance made by Asian banks from issuance made by <b>issuer</b> <b>banks</b> from Europe regions. This study also shows different results compared to previous studies which did not segregate between Asian and Europe <b>issuer</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
50|$|After lengthy negotiations, the {{committee}} led by Hock {{was able to}} persuade Bank of America that a bright future lay ahead for BankAmericard — outside of Bank of America. In June 1970, Bank of America gave up control of the BankAmericard program. The various BankAmericard <b>issuer</b> <b>banks</b> {{took control of the}} program, creating National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), an independent Delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing, promoting and developing the BankAmericard system within the United States. In other words, BankAmericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance, like its competitor Master Charge. Hock became NBI's first president and CEO.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} use an ATM card for in-store EFTPOS {{purchases}} or refunds is no longer allowed, however, if the ATM card is also a debit card, it {{may be used for}} a pin-based debit transaction, or a non-pin-based credit-card transaction if the merchant is affiliated with the credit or debit card network of the card's <b>issuer.</b> <b>Banks</b> have long argued with merchants over the fees that can be charged by the bank for such transactions. Despite the fact that ATM cards require a PIN for use, banks have decided to permit the use of a non-PIN based card (debit or credit) for all merchant transactions.|$|R

40|$|Credit card {{rates have}} been shown to be very high and non-responsive to the changes in the costs of funds. The failure of price {{competition}} led to a shift of interests from price to non-price competition in these markets. Credit card issuers create switching costs for their customers by providing non-price benefits. These benefits are either direct benefits that depend on credit card usage or indirect benefits that arise from the convenience and quality of the general services of the <b>issuer</b> <b>bank.</b> This paper empirically investigates the nature of non-price competition in the Turkish credit card market using panel data, introducing the first study of this kind for an emerging market. As the main result, a significant and robust positive relationship between switching costs and credit card interest rates is obtained, confirming that as non-price benefits increase, banks charge higher credit card interest rates to their customers...|$|E

40|$|Credit {{card debt}} is a {{ubiquitous}} feature of neoliberal capitalism. To explain the notable growth {{of credit card}} usage in the US, I adopt a historical materialist approach that employs two key analytical concepts – cannibalistic capitalism and the debtfare state – to capture the material, institutional and ideological dimensions of this process. Viewed {{within the bounds of}} cannibalistic capitalism, a mode of accumulation primarily based on the expansion of fictitious capital and secondary forms of exploitation, the debtfare state enhances the social power of money by allowing major credit card <b>issuers</b> (<b>banks)</b> to generate high levels of income from uncapped interest rates and policies that ensure the extension of plastic money to those who fall within Marx’s category of the surplus population. While the expansion of debt subjects surplus workers to the disciplinary requirements of the market, it is unable to suspend the main tensions of cannibalistic capitalism, prompting ongoing reconstructions of the debtfare state...|$|R
