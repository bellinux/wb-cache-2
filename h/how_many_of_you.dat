These types of rhyming were noted by Jespersen in his Modern English Grammar as well as Marchand in Categories and Types of Present-Day English Word-Formation.

6000|$|The diamonds, {{which had}} created Rawdon's admiration, {{never went back}} to Mr. Polonius, of Coventry Street, and that gentleman never applied for their restoration, but they retired into a little private repository, in an old desk, which Amelia Sedley had given her years and years ago, and in which Becky kept a number of useful and, perhaps, {{valuable}} things, about which her husband knew nothing. To know nothing, or little, is {{in the nature of}} some husbands. To hide, in the nature of how many women? Oh, ladies! <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> have surreptitious milliners' bills? <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> have gowns and bracelets which you daren't show, or which you wear trembling?--trembling, and coaxing with smiles the husband by your side, who does not know the new velvet gown from the old one, or the new bracelet from last year's, or has any notion that the ragged-looking yellow lace scarf cost forty guineas and that Madame Bobinot is writing dunning letters every week for the money! ...|$|E

5000|$|Following {{is a list}} {{of rules}} that couples endorse in terms of how to argue more constructively. These rules have been {{confirmed}} in Australia and America (Honeycutt, Woods, & Fontenot, 1993; Jones & Gallois, 1989). A technique known as factor analysis revealed four underlying rules for constructive arguing: showing positive understanding, being rationale, concise, and showing consideration characterize happy relationships more than unhappy relationships when persons are arguing. The higher the factor loading in parentheses the more important that rule is in portraying the underlined factor. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these examples <b>you</b> do?

50|$|That is {{basically}} how the theory works, a much thornier problem {{is exactly what}} the theory is for. Some commentators, like Michael Loux, have suggested that the theory of ascent and descent to particulars is intended to provide truth conditions for the quantifiers. T. K.
