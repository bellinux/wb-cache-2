[...] In E. coli, the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the <b>hemimethylation</b> and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences.|$|E
50|$|Mismatch repair is strand-specific. During DNA {{synthesis}} {{the newly}} synthesised (daughter) strand will commonly include errors. In order to begin repair, the mismatch repair machinery distinguishes the newly synthesised strand from the template (parental). In gram-negative bacteria, transient <b>hemimethylation</b> distinguishes the strands (the parental is methylated and daughter is not). However, in other prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the exact mechanism is not clear. It is suspected that, in eukaryotes, newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA transiently contains nicks (before being sealed by DNA ligase) {{and provides a}} signal that directs mismatch proofreading systems to the appropriate strand. This implies that these nicks must {{be present in the}} leading strand, and evidence for this has recently been found.Recent work has shown that nicks are sites for RFC-dependent loading of the replication sliding clamp PCNA, in an orientation-specific manner, such that one face of the donut-shape protein is juxtaposed toward the 3'-OH end at the nick. Oriented PCNA then directs the action of the MutLalpha endonuclease to one strand {{in the presence of a}} mismatch and MutSalpha or MutSbeta.|$|E
40|$|Reactivation of the {{hypoxanthine}} phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene on an inactive human X chromosome in a {{somatic cell}} hybrid was analyzed following exposure to 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine. <b>Hemimethylation</b> and chromatin hypersensitivity in the 5 ' CpG island appeared by 6 h after exposure {{and continued to}} increase for 24 h in an exponentially growing cell culture. These results imply that the conformation of inactive chromatin requires a symmetrically methylated 5 ' G+C-rich promoter region. In addition, quantitative analysis of the time course patterns suggest that chromatin sensitivity changes may depend on strand-specific demethylation. Symmetrically demethylated DNA was first detected at 24 h and continued to increase until 48 h. HPRT mRNA was first detected at 24 h and increased in a biphasic pattern until 48 h. These results suggest that <b>hemimethylation</b> permits nuclease attack but not transcription factor binding, which requires symmetrically demethylated DNA. We also show that in G 1 -arrested cells, 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine {{has no effect on}} methylation, chromatin conformation, or transcription. We conclude that reactivation of the HPRT gene present on the inactive X chromosome of a somatic cell hybrid involves the initial events of DNA <b>hemimethylation</b> and chromatin hypersensitivity at the 5 ' CpG island, followed by symmetrical demethylation and transcriptional reactivation...|$|E

Compared with diploid loach, the methylation patterns of tetraploid sites changed 68. 17 %, and the methylation patterns of triploid sites changed 73. 05 %. The proportion of hypermethylation genes is significantly higher than the proportion of demethylation genes. The methylation level of reciprocal cross F 1 generation is lower than the male diploid and higher than the female tetraploid. The <b>hemimethylation</b> and total methylation rate of the cross hybrid F 1 generation is significantly higher than the orthogonal F 1 generation (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The Caulobacter DNA methyltransferase CcrM {{is one of}} five master cell-cycle regulators. CcrM is transiently present {{near the}} end of DNA {{replication}} when it rapidly methylates the adenine in hemimethylated GANTC sequences. The timing of transcription of two master regulator genes and two cell division genes is controlled by the methylation state of GANTC sites in their promoters. To explore the global extent of this regulatory mechanism, we determined the methylation state of the entire chromosome at every base pair at five time points in the cell cycle using single-molecule, real-time sequencing. The methylation state of 4, 515 GANTC sites, preferentially positioned in intergenic regions, changed progressively from full to <b>hemimethylation</b> as the replication forks advanced. However, 27 GANTC sites remained unmethylated throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that these protected sites could participate in epigenetic regulatory functions. An analysis of the time of activation of every cell-cycle regulatory transcription start site, coupled to both the position of a GANTC site in their promoter regions and the time in the cell cycle when the GANTC site transitions from full to <b>hemimethylation,</b> allowed the identification of 59 genes as candidates for epigenetic regulation. In addition, we identified two previously unidentified N(6) -methyladenine motifs and showed that they maintained a constant methylation state throughout the cell cycle. The cognate methyltransferase was identified for one of these motifs as well as for one of two 5 -methylcytosine motifs...|$|E

Restriction enzyme analyses of the total DNA and the satellite I fragment show that three HpaII sites in the fragment are completely unmethylated in sperm but fully methylated in thymus DNA.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C) in DNA is widespread, the function of this modified base remains unclear. At some specific sites it apparently has an effect in controlling gene expression, but many sites {{do not appear to}} be involved in this regulation. Balanced against its regulatory usefulness at some sites is the mutational risk it imposes upon the cell. Deamination of m 5 C can lead to its replacement by thymine (T). One possible role for excess methylation is strand discrimination in the repair of mismatches. We constructed the complementary hemimethylated single-base-pair mismatches, G T and A C, at a CG site in simian virus 40 DNA, transfected these into the host African green monkey kidney cells (CV- 1), and examined DNA of the progeny for repair at this site. <b>Hemimethylation</b> at two Hha I sites (Gm 5 CGC) bracketing the mismatch directed repair to occur only on the unmethylated strand. Methylation at the multiple Cm 5 CATGG and Gm 6 ATC sites, a pattern normally seen in bacteria, also instructed repair to proceed on the unmethylated strand, although less efficiently. <b>Hemimethylation</b> at only one site, adjacent to the mispaired bases (Hpa II, Cm 5 CGG) produced repaired molecules in a ratio that may represent random repair of the A C mismatch and strand-directed repair in the complementary G T mismatch. The -mCG- -GT- mismatch could result from deamination of m 5 C in the most commonly methylated dinucleotide in vertebrates, CpG. Methylation may be able to compensate for the errors it causes by serving as a mechanism for strand discrimination in correcting those errors. In addition, single-strand nicks were also shown to direct repair...|$|E

In regenerated transgenic plants the integrated gene was constitutively hypermethylated at the sequences CpG and CpNpG and this was correlated with an inactivation of beta-glucuronidase in 12 out of 18 analyzed plant lines whereas two showed slight and four strong activity. From 10 control lines transformed with nonmethylated DNA, only two were inactive; three showed slight and five strong activity. 5 -aza-cytidine treatment of plant tissue from 'hypermethylated' lines led to induction of beta-glucuronidase in most cases.

Similar results were obtained with analogously methylated M 13 RF. Transfection experiments with phi X RF hemimethylated in {{only part of the}} molecule, as assessed by analysis with restriction endonucleases, indicated that gene A of phi X, which needs to be nicked at a specific site by the gene A protein for RF replication, was not the main target for this inhibition by DNA methylation.

Chromosome replication and cell division are strictly coordinated during the growth of Escherichia coli. Initiation of replication and cell division occur at precise moments in the cell cycle, and the division event {{takes place at the}} cell center after correct positioning of the chromosomes. It has often been assumed that this latter event, termed chromo-some partitioning, requires attachment of the chromosome to one or more points in the cell membrane, primarily because prokaryotes lack a visible mitotic apparatus, such as the spindle, which carries out chromosome partitioning in eukaryotes.

An inverse relationship was found between the length of the eclipse and the amount of Dam methyltransferase in the cell, indicating that the eclipse corresponds to the period of origin <b>hemimethylation.</b> The SeqA protein was absolutely required for the eclipse, and DnaA titration studies suggested that the SeqA protein prevented the binding of multiple DnaA molecules on oriC (initial complex formation). No correlation between the amount of SeqA and eclipse length was revealed, but increased SeqA levels affected chromosome partitioning and/or cell division. This was corroborated further by an aberrant nucleoid distribution in SeqA-deficient cells. We suggest that the SeqA protein’s role in maintaining the eclipse is tied to a function in chromosome organization...|$|E
40|$|Following {{initiation}} of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli, newly initiated origins (oriCs) are prevented from further initiations by a mechanism termed sequestration. During the sequestration period (which lasts {{about one-third of}} a cell cycle), the origins remain hemimethylated. The SeqA protein binds hemimethylated oriC in vitro. In vivo, the absence of SeqA causes overinitiation and strongly reduces the duration of <b>hemimethylation.</b> The pattern of immunostained SeqA complexes in vivo suggests that SeqA has a role in organizing hemimethylated DNA at the replication forks. We have {{examined the effects of}} overexpressing SeqA under different cellular conditions. Our data demonstrate that excess SeqA significantly increases the time oriC is hemimethylated following {{initiation of}} replication. In some cells, sequestration continued for more than one generation and resulted in inhibition of primary initiation. SeqA overproduction also interfered with the segregation of sister nucleoids and caused a delay in cell division. These results suggest that SeqA’s function in regulation of replication initiation is linked to chromosome segregation and possibly cell division...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned two DNA {{fragments}} containing 5 '-GATC- 3 ' sites {{at which}} the adenine is methylated in the macronucleus of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Using these cloned fragments as molecular probes, we analyzed the maintenance of methylation patterns at two partially and two uniformly methylated sites. Our results suggest that a semiconservative copying model for maintenance of methylation {{is not sufficient to}} account for the methylation patterns we found during somatic growth of Tetrahymena. Although we detected hemimethylated molecules in macronuclear DNA, they were present in both replicating and nonreplicating DNA. In addition, we observed that a complex methylation pattern including partially methylated sites was maintained during vegetative growth. This required the activity of a methylase capable of recognizing and modifying sites specified by something other than <b>hemimethylation.</b> We suggest that a eucaryotic maintenance methylase may be capable of discriminating between potential methylation sites to ensure the inheritance of methylation patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} of both ColE 1 -type plasmids and plasmids bearing {{the origin of}} {{replication of}} the Escherichia coli chromosome (oriC) {{has been shown to}} be inhibited by <b>hemimethylation</b> of adenine residues within GATC sequences. In the case of oriC plasmids, this inhibition was previously shown to be mediated by the specific affinity of the hemimethylated origin DNA for an outer cell membrane fraction. Here, we suggest that a similar mechanism is operating in the case of the ColE 1 -like plasmid pBR 322 as (i) a hemimethylated DNA fragment carrying the promoter for the RNA which primes DNA synthesis (RNAII) is specifically bound by the same membrane fraction and, (ii) the addition of the membrane fraction to a soluble assay of pBR 322 replication results in preferential inhibition of initiation on the hemimethylated template.

Comparison of this plasmid and a plasmid driven by the host oriC replication origin showed that both origins are subject to control by methylation at two different levels. First, both origins appear {{to be subject to}} negative regulation acting at the level of <b>hemimethylation.</b> This probably involves the sequestration of the hemimethylated DNA produced by replication, as has been previously described for oriC. Second, both origins show a positive requirement for adenine methylation for efficient function in vivo. This conclusion is supported by the behavior of the P 1 origin in an improved in vitro replication system. In vitro, where sequestration of hemimethylated DNA is not expected to occur, the hemimethylated P 1 origin DNA was fully functional as a template. However, the activity of fully unmethylated DNA was severely restricted in comparison with that of either of the methylated forms.

Dnmt 1 alone was able to maintain methylation of most CpG-poor regions analyzed. In contrast, both Dnmt 1 and Dnmt 3 a and/or Dnmt 3 b were required for methylation of a select class of sequences which included abundant murine LINE- 1 promoters. We used a novel <b>hemimethylation</b> assay to show that even in wild-type cells these sequences contain high levels of hemimethylated DNA, suggestive of poor maintenance methylation. We showed that Dnmt 3 a and/or - 3 b could restore methylation of these sequences to pretreatment levels following transient exposure of cells to 5 -aza-CdR, whereas Dnmt 1 by itself could not. We conclude that ongoing de novo methylation by Dnmt 3 a and/or Dnmt 3 b compensates for inefficient maintenance methylation by Dnmt 1 of these endogenous repetitive sequences.

40|$|International audienceProkaryote DNA methyltransferases (MTases) of the Dam family (including {{those of}} bacteriophages T 2 and T 4) {{catalyze}} methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), producing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and methylated adenine residues in palindromic GATC sequences. Dam DNA MTases, as all site-specific enzymes interacting with polymeric DNA, require a {{mechanism of action}} that ensures a rapid search for specific targets for catalytic action, during both the initial and subsequent rounds of methylation. The results of pre-steady-state (reaction burst) and steady-state methylation analyses of individual targets permitted us to monitor the action of T 4 Dam, which has three degrees of freedom: sliding, reorientation and adaptation to the canonical GATC sequence. The salient results are as follows: (i) 40 mer substrate duplexes containing two canonical GATC sites showed differential methylation of the potential targets, i. e., T 4 Dam exhibited a preference for one site/target, which may present the better 'kinetic trap' for the enzyme. (ii) Prior <b>hemimethylation</b> of the two sites made both targets equally capable of being methylated during the pre-steady-state reaction.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, the SeqA protein binds {{specifically}} to GATC sequences which are methylated on the A {{of the old}} strand {{but not on the}} new strand. Such hemimethylated DNA is produced by progression of the replication forks and lasts until Dam methyltransferase methylates the new strand. It is therefore believed that a region of hemimethylated DNA covered by SeqA follows the replication fork. We show that this is, indeed, the case by using global ChIP on Chip analysis of SeqA in cells synchronized regarding DNA replication. To assess <b>hemimethylation,</b> we developed the first genome-wide method for methylation analysis in bacteria. Since loss of the SeqA protein affects growth rate only during rapid growth when cells contain multiple replication forks, a comparison of rapid and slow growth was performed. In cells with six replication forks per chromosome, the two old forks were found to bind surprisingly little SeqA protein. Cell cycle analysis showed that loss of SeqA from the old forks did not occur at initiation of the new forks, but instead occurs at a time point coinciding with the end of SeqA-dependent origin sequestration. The finding suggests simultaneous origin de-sequestration and loss of SeqA from old replication forks...|$|E
40|$|Whereas in Escherichia coli DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is directed to}} the newly synthesized strand due to its transient lack of adenine methylation, the molecular determinants of strand discrimination in eukaryotes are presently unknown. In mammalian cells, cytosine methylation within CpG sites may represent an analogous and mechanistically plausible means of targeting mismatch correction. Using HeLa nuclear extracts, we conducted {{a systematic analysis in}} vitro to determine whether cytosine methylation participates in human DNA {{mismatch repair}}. We prepared a set of A·C heteroduplex molecules that were either unmethylated, hemimethylated or fully methylated at CpG sequences and found that the methylation status persisted under the assay conditions. However, no effect on either the time course or the magnitude of mismatch repair events was evident; only strand discontinuities contributed to strand bias. By western analysis we demonstrated that the HeLa extract contained MED 1 protein, which interacts with MLH 1 and binds to CpG-methylated DNA; supplementation with purified MED 1 protein was without effect. In summary, human DNA mismatch repair operates independently of CpG methylation status, and we found no evidence supporting a role for CpG <b>hemimethylation</b> as a strand discrimination signal...|$|E

However, somatic disruption of DNMT 1 in the human cancer cell line HCT 116 was not lethal and caused only minor decreases in methylation. Here, we report the identification of a truncated DNMT 1 protein, which was generated by the disruption of DNMT 1 in HCT 116 cells. The truncated protein, which had parts of the regulatory N-terminal domain deleted but preserved the catalytic C-terminal domain, was present at different levels in all DNMT 1 single-knockout and DNMT 1 /DNMT 3 b double-knockout cell lines tested and retained hemimethylase activity. DNMT 1 RNAi resulted in decreased cell viability in WT and knockout cells and further loss of DNA methylation in DNMT 1 knockout cells. Furthermore, we observed a delay in methylation after replication and an increase in <b>hemimethylation</b> of specific CpG sites in cells expressing the truncated protein. Remethylation studies after drug-induced hypomethylation suggest a putative role of DNMT 1 in the de novo methylation of a subtelomeric repeat, D 4 Z 4, which is lost in cells lacking full-length DNMT 1.

Previous studies have been focused on imprinted genes with DNA methylation in poor quality human sperms.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing method, we examined methylation patterns of the promoter of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (NG_ 013351 : 1538 – 1719) in sperm DNA obtained from 94 idiopathic infertile men and 54 normal fertile controls. Subjects with idiopathic infertility were further divided into groups of normozoospermia and oligozoospermia. Overall, 45 % (41 / 94) of idiopathic infertile males had MTHFR hypermethylation (both <b>hemimethylation</b> and full methylation), compared with 15 % of fertile controls (P, 0. 05). Subjects with higher methylation level of MTHFR {{were more likely to}} have idiopathic male infertility (P-value for trend = 0. 0007).

In {{this study we}} have analyzed the repair by human cell extracts of G:T mismatches in various DNA contexts. We performed two sets of experiments. In the first, repair was sequence specific in that G:T mispairs at CpG sites at four different CpG sites were repaired, but a G:T mismatch at a GpG site was not. Cytosine <b>hemimethylation</b> did not block repair of a substrate containing a CpG/GpT mismatch. In {{the second set of}} experiments, substrates with a G:T mismatch at a fixed position were constructed with an A, T, G, or C 5 ' to the mismatched G, and alterations in the complementary strand to allow otherwise perfect Watson-Crick pairing. All were incised just 5 ' to the mismatched T and competed for repair incision with a G:T substrate in which a C was 5 ' to the mismatched G. Thus human G:T mismatch activity shows sequence specificity, incising G:T mismatched pairs at some DNA sites, but not at others.

It has been suggested that DNA methylation in conjunction with methylation-sensitive transposase binding to DNA may control the association of Ac transposition and replication. We present here a detailed genomic sequencing analysis of the cytosine methylation patterns of the transposase binding sites within both Ac ends in the wx-m 9 ::Ac allele, where Ac is inserted into the tenth exon of the Waxy gene. The Ac elements in wx-m 9 ::Ac kernels exhibit intriguing methylation patterns and fall into two distinct groups. Approximately 50 % of the elements are fully unmethylated at cytosine residues through the 256 nucleotides at the 5 ' end (the promoter end). The other half is partially methylated between Ac residues 27 and 92. In contrast, at the 3 ' end, all Ac molecules are heavily methylated between residues 4372 and 4554. The more internally located Ac sequences and the flanking Waxy DNA are unmethylated. Although most methylated cytosines in Ac are in the symmetrical CpG and CpNpG arrangements, nonsymmetrical cytosine methylation is also common in the hypermethylated regions of Ac. These results suggest a model in which differential activation of transposon ends by <b>hemimethylation</b> controls the chromatid selectivity of transposition and the association with replication...|$|E

DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) primarily establish and maintain global DNA methylation patterns; however, the molecular mechanisms for the generation and inheritance of methylation patterns are still poorly understood. We used sucrose density gradients of nucleosomes prepared by partial and maximum micrococcal nuclease digestion, coupled with Western blot analysis to probe for the interactions between DNMTs and native nucleosomes. This method allows for analysis of the in vivo interactions between the chromatin modification enzymes and their actual nucleosomal substrates in the native state. We show that little free DNA methyltransferase 3 A and 3 B (DNMT 3 A/ 3 B) exist in the nucleus and {{that almost all of}} the cellular contents of DNMT 3 A/ 3 B, but not DNMT 1, are strongly anchored to a subset of nucleosomes. This binding of DNMT 3 A/ 3 B does not require the presence of other well-known chromatin-modifying enzymes or proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, heterochromatin protein 1, methyl-CpG binding protein 2, Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2, histone deacetylase 1, and UHRF 1, but it does require an intact nucleosomal structure. We also show that nucleosomes containing methylated SINE and LINE elements and CpG islands are the main sites of DNMT 3 A/ 3 B binding.

40|$|Like many eukaryotes, {{bacteria}} make {{widespread use}} of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Unlike eukaryotes, however, bacteria use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation plays roles in the virulence of diverse pathogens of humans and livestock animals, including pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine at GANTC sites by the CcrM methylase regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation at GATC sites by the Dam methylase provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage genomes, transposase activity, and regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional repression by Dam methylation {{appears to be more}} common than transcriptional activation. Certain promoters are active only during the <b>hemimethylation</b> interval that follows DNA replication; repression is restored when the newly synthesized DNA strand is methylated. In the E. coli genome, however, methylation of specific GATC sites can be blocked by cognate DNA binding proteins. Blockage of GATC methylation beyond cell division permits transmission of DNA methylation patterns to daughter cells and can give rise to distinct epigenetic states, each propagated by a positive feedback loop. Switching between alternative DNA methylation patterns can split clonal bacterial populations into epigenetic lineages in a manner reminiscent of eukaryotic cell differentiation. Inheritance of self-propagating DNA methylation patterns governs phase variation in the E. coli pap operon, the agn 43 gene, and other loci encoding virulence-related cell surface functions...|$|E

The NHP- 1 can {{be separated from the}} estradiol receptor chromatographically; it does not bind estradiol and does not cross-react with an antibody directed against the estradiol receptor. A series of synthetic "mutant" oligonucleotides were tested in a protein-DNA binding competition assay. Deletion of the GCG {{in the center of the}} dyad symmetry sequence suppressed the binding of NHP- 1 by 90 %, and the conversion of any GC pair to an AT pair decreased the affinity of the binding site for NHP- 1. Methylation of the two CpGs on both strands of the dyad symmetry sequence decreased the affinity of the binding site for NHP- 1 by 60 %, whereas <b>hemimethylation</b> of the same structure did not inhibit the binding of NHP- 1. NHP- 1 and NHP- 2, the NHP binding to the DNA next to the dyad symmetry sequence, bind exclusively to double-stranded DNA. NHP- 2 has a molecular weight of 60, 000.

We used Hpa II and Msp I isoschizomers (Promega, USA) for double-enzyme cleavage in combination with EcoR I, respectively. Each plant sample was analyzed via the two lanes, in which one lane was digested by EcoR I/Hpa II and the other by EcoR I/Msp I. Based on presence (marked as 1) or absence (marked as 0) of band, generated MSAP bands could be grouped into four types of methylation patterns. Type I (00): no band present in any lanes. This is attributed to methylation of the external cytosines (on both strands) or a full methylation of both cytosines. Type II (01): bands present in the EcoR I/Msp I lane, and these MSAP bands were caused by hypomethylation of the outer C relative to the internal C. Type III (10): bands present in the EcoR I/Hpa II lane, and these bands were associated with <b>hemimethylation</b> of the outer C. Type IV (11): bands present in both two lanes. These bands correspond to unmethylation. The methylation rate obtained by MSAP is generally lower than the sample’s actual methylation level, {{for the reason that}} both Hpa II and Msp I can not cleave sites of the external cytosines (mCGG). To make the result more closer with the sample’s actual methylation level, we calculated the methylation rate by the following formula: total rate of methylation (%)[*]=[*]Total number of methylation bands (Type I[*]+[*]Type II[*]+[*]Type III)/Total number of amplified bands (Type II[*]+[*]Type III[*]+[*]Type IV)[*]×[*] 100 %.|$|E
