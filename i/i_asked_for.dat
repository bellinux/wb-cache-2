I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I guess. I was flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E

The United States of America was first released in 1968 on Columbia Records. The album spent nine weeks on the charts in the United States, peaking at number 181 on the Billboard album charts in May 1968. The album failed to chart in Britain. The album was reissued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1992 with two bonus tracks. In 1997, the album was re-issued in the United Kingdom on Edsel Records. On July 13, 2004 Sundazed Records re-issued the album on vinyl and compact disc with a new album cover from the original UK and Europe releases, and with the CD version containing 10 bonus tracks. USA member Joseph Byrd claims to have little input to the Sundazed re-release of the album.
