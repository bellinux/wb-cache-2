5|$|A {{number of}} {{correlative}} epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (measured by blood levels) {{in a number}} of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{has been}} placed in the {{subfamily}} Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Attaleinae, together with the genera Allagoptera, Beccariophoenix, Butia, Cocos, Jubaea, Jubaeopsis, Lytocaryum, Parajubaea, Syagrus and Voanioala. Within this subtribe, Attalea <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a monophyletic group, and sister to the clade containing Allagoptera, Polyandrococos, Parajubaea, Butia and Jubaea.|$|E
5|$|Diphenhydramine, a first-generation H1 {{receptor}} antagonist {{or medicine}} that combats the H1 receptor that {{is associated with}} many allergic reactions, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.|$|E
50|$|Where as most Ctenophores are hermaphroditic, certain platyctenids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asexual, and furthermore, {{where other}} Ctenophores <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{reproduce}} using external fertilization, certain species of platyctenids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> use brood pouches.|$|R
50|$|Meditation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to high {{activity}} in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> correlate with happiness.|$|R
50|$|L. rhamnosus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{intestinal}} permeability {{in children who}} suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, and it also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> counter alcohol-related {{intestinal permeability}}.|$|R
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more effective than}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There {{appears to be a}} modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E
5|$|Megazol {{in a study}} {{seems more}} active against Chagas than {{benznidazole}} but has not been studied in humans. A Chagas vaccine (TcVac3) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective in mice with plans for studies in dogs. It is hoped {{that it will be}} commercially available by 2018.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} ash <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% sulphur.|$|E
50|$|Cardiovascular system: Social support <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lower {{cardiovascular}} reactivity <b>to</b> stressors. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{lower blood}} pressure and heart rates, which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.|$|R
5000|$|Pregnancy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} {{levels of}} cortisol in the body. In particular, breast-feeding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> decrease levels of cortisol {{in the short-term}} even if a mother is exposed to a psychosocial stressor.|$|R
50|$|At {{one end of}} {{the genetic}} spectrum, duplications of {{chromosomes}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to autism and macrocephaly; at the other end, deletions of chromosomes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to schizophrenia and microcephaly.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> problematic.|$|E
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{there is}} no single, {{universal}} treatment that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> cure myoclonus dystonia. However, there are several treatment methods that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective for helping to reduce the symptoms associated with the syndrome.|$|R
25|$|Some illegal {{weight loss}} {{products}} imported into Ireland <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain sibutramine. Similar concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raised in Australia, where illegal imported supplements <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain sibutramine, resulting in public alerts from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration.|$|R
25|$|Apart from a {{wide variety}} of {{medications}} in use to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with ovulatory cycles, oral progestogens like dydrogesterone <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most commonly prescribed as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> prevent heavy bleeding.|$|R
5|$|Links between other {{infections and}} GBS are less certain. Two other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus/HHV-4 and {{varicella}} zoster virus/HHV-3) and the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{have been associated}} with GBS. The tropical viral infection dengue fever and Zika virus have also been associated with episodes of GBS. Previous hepatitis E virus infection <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more common in people with Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Obesity in pets {{is common}} in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate of obesity in cats was {{slightly}} higher at 6.4%. In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 7.6%. The risk of obesity in dogs is related {{to whether or not}} their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent attempts have been made using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their scat, while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just as good, or better, as a source of DNA as scat.|$|E
5000|$|Telmisartan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{activity}} {{against a}} variety of cancers in vitro, including prostate, renal, colon, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. [...] The mechanisms of telmisartan's anti-cancer activity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> include up-regulation of proliferator-activated-receptor (PPAR) pathway, Bcl-2, and caspase activation.|$|R
25|$|Cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak antiandrogen activity at high doses. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> directly and competitively displace testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which {{are involved in}} the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, cimetidine can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|R
50|$|Skull {{morphology}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary {{in animals}} separated by space in this broad region. Skull length <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary independently from body length. From comparative analysis in morphology, two sub populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> exist; one being {{centered in the}} Tien-Shan region and a southern population being found in the Pamir-Hindu Kush mountain system. Like many rodents, the silvery mountain vole possesses hypsodont molars that are ever growing, and are adapted for feeding on fibrous material.|$|R
5|$|With {{the factory}} {{temporarily}} shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc. Under his leadership, {{the energy crisis}} is solved by harvesting children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more potent. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door and only needs one final piece, which Sulley took as a memento. Sulley enters and joyfully reunites with Boo.|$|E
5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present {{in the blood of}} bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E
5|$|PSR B1534+11 is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of two neutron stars orbiting each other, {{one of which is}} a pulsar with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, validating the system's relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory. The X-ray emission from the system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial pulsar wind of the pulsar, and the system's orbit has been found to vary slightly.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth rate}} of this species <b>is</b> rapid. Juveniles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the diameter of their bases by 0.6 to 0.8 mm per day. By the age of 5 months, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reach an average basal diameter of 45 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The only widely studied emotion, {{with respect}} to persuasion, <b>is</b> fear. Fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> force {{individuals}} [...] "to break from routine and {{pay close attention to}} the external world," [...] including persuasive messages. Moreover, fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> encourage political engagement: ...|$|R
5000|$|Gender <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> impact {{base line}} levels of cortisol, {{contributing}} to between-person variance. In generally stressful situations, levels of cortisol in males <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> increase to {{nearly double the}} amount when compared to females. In stressful social situations (i.e. social rejection challenge), however, women but not men tend to show {{significantly higher levels of}} cortisol.|$|R
5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficiently out of equilibrium as {{to require}} further investigation. Analysis {{of data from}} the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions has found the chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it {{is present in the}} Venusian atmosphere. However, the planet's volcanism could explain the presence of carbonyl sulfide. In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
50|$|MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{significantly}} decrease {{concentrations of}} DHT in sebum, similarly to the selective 5α-reductase type II inhibitor finasteride. However, whereas finasteride results {{in only a}} modest reduction in sebum DHT levels of 15%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> produce a significantly greater reduction of 55%. While finasteride decreases semen DHT levels by approximately 88%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no effect on levels of DHT in semen. These findings are {{in accordance with the}} known tissue distribution of 5α-reductase isoforms.|$|R
25|$|Testosterone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{act as an}} {{antagonist}} of the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors for the neurotrophin nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF), with high affinity (around 5nM). In contrast to testosterone, DHEA and DHEA sulfate <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> act as high-affinity agonists of these receptors.|$|R
