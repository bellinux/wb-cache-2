40|$|Australia has {{a unique}} part {{to play in the}} {{international}} campaign, writes Daniel Tynan THERE is a widely held view, particularly among security analysts in the United States, that the world is on the cusp of an unprecedented wave of nuclear weapons proliferation. Former US Secretary of Defence, William Perry, earlier this year remarked, “I believe we are at a tipping point of proliferation. And if the world does tip, it will be irreversible and dangerous beyond most people’s imagination. ”There are many reasons why we find ourselves in this position. There are over 25, 000 nuclear weapons deployed around the world, 4000 of which on high-alert and can be launched within minutes. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was negotiated in 1996, is yet to enter force and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty has been abandoned. Belligerent states, including North Korea and Iran, are actively pursuing nuclear weapons programs and recent reports suggest that they may each now be sharing their technology with other states. <b>Just</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> American intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran has enough nuclear fuel to make a rapid, if risky, sprint to produce the enriched uranium needed to make a nuclear weapon. Sceptics of the project of abolishing nuclear weapons believe that it is naive to think that determined proliferators can be restrained or that the global nuclear arsenal can be eliminated. Fortunately, since the election of Barack Obama, renewed interest in eliminating nuclear weapons is emerging. Earlier this year, President Obama spoke of “America 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. ” This sentiment was echoed by Kevin Rudd, who has said that Australia must also “be committed to the ultimate objective of a nuclear weapons free world. ” Positive results are also beginning to be achieved in relation to curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The challenge of achieving total nuclear disarmament certainly cannot be understated, but the emerging groundswell of support should encourage the international community to expand efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. The mere existence of nuclear weapons means that the international community faces an irreducible risk that armed conflict between states or from terrorist organisations might at some point escalate into nuclear warfare. It is essential that countries like Australia, with the resources, capacity and international standing to act, take the lead in developing practical policy solutions to champion the elimination of nuclear weapons. The starting point should be a reconsideration of Australia’s own nuclear policy. At present, Australia’s security framework supports the elimination of nuclear weapons in principle, but relies on the policy of extended deterrence provided by the United States’ allied nuclear umbrella. Successive Australian governments, including the Rudd government, have acknowledged that so long as nuclear weapons exist there is value in the “protection afforded by extended nuclear deterrence under the US Alliance. ” Australia cannot credibly assert its commitment to eliminating nuclear weapons while remaining entirely dependent on US nuclear power as the bedrock of our regional defence strategy. Australia is strongly placed to influence multilateral nuclear disarmament initiatives. We have a proud tradition of supporting non-proliferation measures on the international stage. As a close ally, Australia could lobby and encourage the United States to ratify the CTBT and support multilateral engagement to re-commence negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. The latter would cap the amount of enriched uranium and plutonium available for nuclear weapons. Leadership from the United States might encourage other nations to act responsibly. Earlier this year, Indonesia – one of nine countries yet to ratify the CTBT – announced that it would immediately sign on if the United States did so first. Another priority is the negotiation of a binding Nuclear Weapons Convention. There are encouraging signs that this is achievable. Multilateral diplomacy has lead to the banning of chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions. Some countries, including Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, have divested themselves of nuclear weapons; some other countries, including Brazil, Japan and South Africa, have abandoned nuclear weapons programs altogether. With the support of like-minded nations and the backing of the United States, Australia could take the lead in examining this proposal and developing a comprehensive framework that would prohibit the development, testing, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. As the source of the world’s largest reserves of uranium ore and the second largest exporter of uranium, Australia is uniquely placed to develop and enforce best practice for the safe management of civilian nuclear technologies. While civil nuclear power does not, of itself, present a proliferation problem, there are proliferation risks inherent in the spread of uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies. There is also a {{need to make sure that}} there is transparency in the uses and export of civil nuclear resources. Australia could be a global leader in ensuring that civil nuclear cooperation serves exclusively peaceful purposes and does not contribute to global nuclear weapons programs. Australia should also seek to establish itself as a global authority on non-proliferation and disarmament strategy. Drawing on the initial work of the joint Australian–Japanese International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, this could be achieved by establishing a permanent, government funded research institute focussed on the development of public policy in this field. A concentration of intellectual capital in such an organisation, could also be utilised to expand the number of security analysts trained in Australia and to promote collaboration with US organisations such as the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. No one would doubt that the task of abolishing nuclear weapons is a daunting one. Australia has the resources and capacity to play a leading role in this effort by identifying and implementing some priority steps that are politically imaginable and feasible. •Daniel Tynan is a barrister.

40|$|The {{status quo}} in Australia is shifting, writes George Williams WHEN it comes to freedom of speech we {{are in danger of}} losing our sense of perspective, as well as our sense of humour. The latest {{proposal}} from Attorney-General Philip Ruddock is to ban books that praise terrorism and to censor TV shows like Big Brother. As Australians, we take freedom of speech for granted. It is one of the bedrocks upon which our democracy is built, an assumption that underpins our law and politics. Yet far from being liberal about what we can say, the law already prohibits may things that are the subject of public debate in other nations. We cannot hear on the radio, and are unable to buy, the most popular musical work of political satire in Australia from the past decade. We even now have laws that {{make it more difficult to}} express an unpopular opinion or to hold government to account. People can find themselves in jail for what they say and not just for what they do. Over the past decade there have been clear signals that when it comes to speech Australians are not nearly as free as we like to think. Our democracy depends upon voters being able to speak freely during elections. We must be able to criticise policies, parties and candidates without fear of prosecution and tell others about how the electoral process works. But in 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for advocating a formal, valid vote. Langer, a political agitator, described John Howard and Paul Keating as “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” and urged voters to put them and their parties equal last on the ballot paper. The Commonwealth Electoral Act specifically allowed for such a vote. But it also made it a crime to advocate the vote, something that Langer did with great gusto. About 46, 000 people voted in 1996 using the Langer method, an increase of 500 per cent from 1993. Langer was prosecuted. An appeal to the High Court failed and he was sent to jail for ten weeks for telling people about a method of voting that was perfectly legal. Amnesty International declared him to be the “first prisoner of conscience in the country for over 20 years”. The law has since been changed to make such a vote informal - it will no longer count. Australia is also plagued with undue censorship, even about matters of obvious political importance. In 1997, Pauline Pantsdown released her hit song Backdoor Man, a parody of One Nation Party founder Pauline Hanson, then nearing the height of her fame and political influence. The song, a ridiculous compilation of Hanson’s own words, contained the famous lines: “I’m a backdoor man. I’m homosexual. I’m proud of it... I’m a backdoor man for the Ku Klux Klan with a very horrendous plan. I’m a very caring potato... Please explain. ” It was a huge hit on youth radio network Triple J, where it was requested so often that it leapt to No 5 on the hottest 100 list of that year. Six days after Triple J began playing Backdoor Man Hanson sought and gained a court injunction, under defamation law, that made it illegal to play the song. The injunction has never been lifted, and though it only applies to the ABC, other radio stations do not play the song. When I tried to buy Backdoor Man to play to my students, I was told by the store that it did not stock it because it was illegal to sell. In fact, I found out that the song had never been released as a single because of how quickly it was banned. It is listed in, but the track is not actually contained on, Triple J’s hottest 100 for 1997. This would not occur in New Zealand, the US, Canada or Britain, which, unlike Australia, have protected freedom of speech in a bill or charter of rights. My next two examples fall after September 11. We have gained new laws that were unthinkable prior to the attack. One of those laws allows ASIO to detain Australian citizens for questioning for up to a week even when they are not suspected of any crime. While detained, a person can be compelled to reveal information about family members, sources or anything else they may know, upon pain of five years’ jail. The ASIO detention regime makes it an offence to disclose “operational information” about a person’s detention within two years of that person being detained. Operational information is defined very widely to include information that ASIO “has or had” or “an operational capability, method or plan” of ASIO’s. Revealing such information, even the mere fact that someone was detained, can incur up to five years’ imprisonment. There are no exceptions for cases of fair reporting, such as a story revealing that ASIO has abused its powers or mistreated (or even tortured) detainees. If someone is mistreated while being detained, we may have to wait at least two years to find this out. Combined with the secrecy that surrounds so many of our new terror laws, and the fact that it is a crime to even identify an ASIO officer, this is a grave threat to government accountability. Then there is the sedition law passed in Australia late last year. This law criminalises people for what they say if, among other things, they urge by force or violence the overthrow of the constitution or the government. The penalty is jail for up to seven years. Sedition had, at least until recently, been regarded as a discredited offence because of its use in Australia and other nations against political oppositions. Those charged with sedition include Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and even Peter Lalor after the 1854 Eureka Stockade. To define terrorism is notoriously hard, and our law provides no leeway for why someone has committed violence or damaged property. Former South African leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mandela was called a terrorist by many during his fight against the apartheid regime. He would certainly have been classified as such under Australia’s new laws. Sedition has been re-enacted in a form that suggests that it is an important part of the government’s war on terror. While it has been “modernised”, it provides few exceptions. There is no clear protection for academic works or even comedy or satire. Black humour, such as on ABC TV’s The Chaser’s War on Everything, that uses the words or an image of Osama bin Laden has the potential to become a criminal offence. Attorney-General Philip Ruddock has said he will not use the sedition law in such circumstances. But there is no guarantee about how this or future governments will apply the law, and this also neglects the larger problem of self-censorship. Sedition and other laws have an inevitable chilling effect on what we say. Artists and commentators are now less likely to use robust critical speech about the war on terror or other sensitive topics due to concern they may breach the law. When people do not have free on-the-spot legal advice, they may not speak for fear of the consequences. Exactly how the new sedition law will make Australians safer from terrorism has not been made clear. Indeed, there is a risk that the law will further ostracise members of those communities that feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are already the target of government action. There is also the potential that the law will push speech underground that promotes political violence rather than enabling it to be contested in public debate. Unfortunately, banning speech can even make the ideas it embodies more popular to some. These examples, among many others, demonstrate how fragile freedom of speech is in Australia. They expose how we assume, rather than actually protect, freedom of speech. The changes since September 11 are especially troubling. To a greater extent even than nations such as Britain and the US, our law has come to reflect the maxim of President George Bush that “you’re either with us or against us”. Unlike Australia, those nations protect free speech through a clear statement of law. The US has its 1791 constitutional Bill of Rights; Britain has an act of Parliament, the 1998 Human Rights Act. In Australia, the vulnerability of freedom of speech and other rights, such as to vote and freedom of association, has led to renewed calls for a rights bill or charter. While John Howard has said that this will never occur under his watch, change is afoot. The ACT was the first to move, with its Human Rights Act passed in 2004.

40|$|Kristie Dunn and Jessica Howard {{compare the}} key legal {{decisions}} in Australia and Britain IN DISCUSSING {{the right of}} a person to challenge their unlawful detention, Sir William Deane, then a Justice of the High Court of Australia, said: It cannot be too strongly stressed that these basic matters are not the stuff of empty rhetoric. They are the very fabric of the freedom under the law which is the prima facie right of every citizen and alien in this land. They represent a bulwark against tyranny. 1 The right to challenge unlawful detention and obtain an order for release - known as habeas corpus - is an ancient and powerful tool. It was once said that it can reach even behind iron bars to release a person unlawfully detained. But the remedy has so far been of limited assistance to asylum seekers in Australia. There are two main reasons for this - the first is that the Australian Constitution grants the government very broad powers to deal with non-citizens or ‘aliens’; the second is that international legal norms are not directly enforceable in Australian law. The right to liberty is not just a fundamental human right under international law. The right of every person to be free is a notion that lies {{at the very heart of}} the western liberal tradition. However, since the birth of the mandatory detention system in Australia in 1992, the traditional common law presumption in favour of liberty is a privilege not afforded to asylum seekers arriving on our shores. 2 Lim’s case & the beginning of mandatory detention in Australia The story of Australia’s mandatory detention regime starts with Lim’s case, decided in the High Court in 1993. 3 The applicants in that case were two groups of Cambodian boat people who arrived in Australia in 1989 and 1990. Upon arriving in Australia, the boat-people were detained, and applied for asylum. Their applications for asylum were unsuccessful. They then challenged the lawfulness of their continued detention in the newly opened Port Hedland detention centre in far north-west Western Australia. Two days before the case was heard in the Federal Court of Australia, the Australian Parliament passed legislation requiring the Cambodians to be kept in immigration detention until either they were granted a visa or removed from Australia. It also provided that a Court could not order their release from detention. This was the first mandatory detention regime in Australia. This new regime was challenged within a few weeks by Mr Lim and the other Cambodians in the High Court of Australia. The basis of the challenge in the High Court was that the Commonwealth government did not have the power to detain aliens, as it was only for courts, not governments, to deprive someone of their liberty. The High Court decided that while that was the case for citizens, non-citizens were in a different position. The Constitution gives the federal parliament a broad power to deal with aliens and part of that power is the power to administratively detain aliens. Administrative detention of this sort is only lawful, the court said, if it is for a non-punitive purpose - in other words, that it is not designed to punish the people being detained. Detaining people for the purpose of processing of a visa application or pending their removal from the country was, unlike imprisonment under the criminal law, considered to be administrative rather than punitive. The court said that the regime under which Mr Lim and the other applicants were being detained was non-punitive for two main reasons. First, the detainees could end their detention at any time by choosing to leave Australia. According to the Court, it ‘always lies within the power of a person to bring his or her detention in custody to an end by requesting to be removed from Australia’. This ability to elect to end detention is in contrast to punitive detention, in which there is no such choice. Second, unlike the current regime, the regime under consideration in Lim’s case imposed a time limit on detention. 4 This was also considered to be important by the High Court, as it meant that even if a detainee did not choose to bring their detention to an end, they could not be detained indefinitely. For these reasons, the regime was held by the High Court to be lawful. 5 A v Australia One of the applicants, known as A, then took the case to the UN Human Rights Committee arguing that Australia was in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which had been ratified by the Australian government. Article 9 (1) of the ICCPR provides that every person has the right to liberty, and shall not be arbitrarily arrested or detained. Article 9 (4) enables anyone detained or arrested to challenge the lawfulness of their detention in a court. The Human Rights Committee declared that Australia’s detention system breached these two provisions. In response, the Australian government ignored the decision, retained the mandatory detention system, and expanded it to include all unauthorised arrivals. It was able to do so because international law is not binding and is not directly enforceable in Australian courts unless legislation is passed to incorporate it into, or make it a part of, the Australian legal system. As there was no legislation incorporating the ICCPR in Australian law, the government could ignore the committee’s decision. However, as the result of a political compromise, Applicant A and many of the other Cambodians were eventually granted permission to stay in Australia after four years of legal challenges to their detention. As the story of Mr Lim and Applicant A shows, the fact that Australia has ratified the ICCPR, thereby agreeing to be bound by it at international law, means little on the domestic front given the disjuncture between international and domestic law. For this reason international human rights norms are of minimal assistance to asylum seekers challenging their continued detention by the Australian government. The current regime As we have said, Lim provides a legal justification for the continued (and expanded) policy of mandatory detention in Australia. Under that policy, all unlawful non-citizens must be detained until they are granted a visa (such as a protection visa) or are removed from the country, either ‘voluntarily’ or by means of deportation in cases involving criminal offences. Section 198 is the ‘voluntary removal’ provision, considered so important in Lim. It provides that a detained person may request at any time that the Minister remove them from Australia. Once a ‘voluntary removal’ request is made, the Minister must remove the person ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’. This places an implied time limit on the detention of such people. A similar implication applies to deportation cases. However, there is no express or implied time limit placed on the detention of people waiting for a visa. There is a real question as to whether the absence of a time-limit on the processing of applications for visas sufficiently distinguishes the current regime from that considered to be lawful in Lim. If so, it could affect the constitutionality (or lawfulness) of the current regime, as it effectively permits indefinite detention. Recent Federal Court cases Stories about asylum seekers who have been subjected to prolonged detention are slowly beginning to be heard. We will mention a few cases that have recently been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. For many of these people, the Court has found that their continued detention is unlawful and has ordered their release. While this is a dramatic result for the people involved - granting them freedom on an interim basis until the cases are finally determined at trial - they do not strike at the heart of the detention regime, unlike what was attempted in Lim. There is an assumption, it seems, that the current detention regime is lawful, despite being differently drafted and implemented to the regime considered in Lim. In each of the following cases, the detention is challenged not on the basis that the entire regime is unlawful, but rather that the government has exceeded its authority under the Migration Act in relation to the detention of a particular individual. (a) Mr Al Masri: Mr Al Masri is a Palestinian from a part of the Gaza Strip under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Upon arriving in Australia in June 2001, he was detained at Woomera Detention Centre, in remote South Australia. He claimed to be a refugee and applied for a protection visa. His claim was unsuccessful. In December 2001 he asked to be returned to the Gaza Strip; six months later he was still in Woomera waiting to be removed. He commenced proceedings in the Federal Court seeking release from detention. Mr Al Masri contended that the power of the government to detain for the purpose of removing someone from Australia is impliedly limited to a reasonable time, and terminates when there is no reasonable likelihood of removal. Otherwise, the Act would permit indefinite detention, which is unlawful. The Minister for Immigration argued that the government can lawfully detain someone so long as the detention is for the purpose of removal from Australia; that is, there is no time limit imposed on detention. Justice Merkel held that the detention provisions only authorise detention for so long as the Minister: is taking all reasonable steps to secure the person’s removal from Australia ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’ and that the removal is ‘reasonably practicable’ in the sense that there must be a real likelihood or prospect of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. In Mr Al Masri’s case, the Minister had taken all reasonable steps to secure his removal from Australia by contacting all possible entry points - Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt. Those steps had been unsuccessful. When the proceedings were heard in late July, there was still no evidence of any real likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Mr Al Masri’s continued detention was held to be unlawful and Merkel J ordered his release from detention on 15 August. Two weeks later, the Minister secured permission for the entry of Mr Al Masri and other Palestinians to Gaza. Mr Al Masri was placed in detention pending his deportation and is no longer in the country. This case has the potential to affect the detention of all people waiting to be removed from Australia where there is no real likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future. Failed Iranian and Iraqi asylum seekers would fall into this category. In fact, <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> Justice Mansfield ordered the release of a failed Iraqi asylum seeker - Mr Al Khafaji - on very similar grounds to Mr Al Masri. For this reason, the government has appealed the decision in Al Masri’s case - even though he is no longer in the country - and we are waiting for the decision of the Full Federal Court, which is expected to be handed down soon. (b) The Hazara Afghanis: The next series of unlawful detention cases that appeared in the Federal Court involved four Hazara Afghani asylum seekers whose applications were being processed around the time that the war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan started. Unfortunately, we do not know the names of any of these applicants, due to changes to the Migration Act in 2001 prohibiting the courts from disclosing the name of applicants for protection visas. 6 Codes are used instead - hence ‘VFAD’ v Minister. We will refer to these four applicants as the Hazara Afghanis for now. Each applicant was an Hazara Afghani male who had arrived in Australia in early 2001. Through documents obtained by the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre under the Freedom of Information Act, the applicants discovered what appeared to be decisions signed by Immigration Department officials dating back to August 2001. They were decisions that appeared to grant them protection visas. However, these decisions were never communicated to the applicants and the Minister said that they were draft decisions only. After these ‘decisions’ appeared to have been made, the Minister for Immigration announced that given the changing situation in Afghanistan, there would be a department wide ‘freeze’ on the processing of all Afghani asylum applications until the situation had stabilised. Afghani asylum seekers were notified of this policy decision in mid-January this year, leading to protests at Woomera. Once processing recommenced after the fall of the Taliban, each of the applicants was denied a protection visa based on the changed circumstances in Afghanistan. The ultimate question in these cases is whether the ‘decisions’ were final decisions to grant protection visas to the applicants. If so, the processing freeze would have had no legal effect on them and the applicants should have been released from detention when the decisions were made. In each case, it was found that the applicants had a strong case for saying that the decisions were final decisions, and that they had been granted protection visas. This question will not, however, be determined until a final hearing takes place. The issue in these cases, though, was whether the applicants should be kept in detention until the final hearing. If the applicants succeed in proving that the decision records did constitute the grant of a visa, they will have been unlawfully detained since the decision was made. In reaching its decision in each case, the Court had to balance the strict requirements of the Migration Act with the law’s presumption in favour of liberty. The judges in each of these cases came down on the side of liberty. As Justice Gray put it: The protection of individual liberty is of such fundamental importance to the Australian legal system that the mere fact that the applicant is in detention must be given considerable weight. All four men were released into the care of a local charity, and are required to report to the Department on a regular basis until their hearings, which are scheduled early next year. (c) The ‘NAMU’ family: In many of these cases, evidence is led by the applicants of the detrimental effects of prolonged detention. About one of the Hazara Afghani applicants, Gray J said: He said he has been in detention for so long that he is now exhausted and depressed He feels as if his soul is not healthy and he is no longer human [...] . He feels like a fish that has just been caught, in its last moment before death. In another recent Federal Court case, it was argued that the effect of detention on children justified their release from detention. Applicant NAMU’s case (another pseudonym) was brought by a husband and wife and their four children, three of whom were under 18 years old. They are Iraqi nationals who fled in 1995 and arrived in Australia in 1999. They have been in detention since that time - about three years. The family claimed that their detention, although originally lawful, had become unlawful due to the severe psychological disturbances suffered by their children as a result of their detention. It was claimed that by placing the children in a situation where they had become suicidal the detention had stopped being administrative in nature and had become punitive. According to the reasoning in Lim’s case, punitive detention is unlawful. Justice Hely disagreed with this view on the basis that it is the purpose of detention, not its impact on individuals, that is the relevant question. He said that the purpose of detention remained valid - as the family was still pursuing visa applications, they were being detained for the purpose of being granted a visa. They have appealed his decision and are waiting in detention for the outcome of the appeal. As mentioned earlier, there is no restriction on the amount of time a person may be detained while waiting for a visa. As the processing freeze in relation to the Hazara Afghanis shows, there seems to be no obligation on the Minister to process applications within a fixed time frame. This is further highlighted by the case of the East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia - who arrived here eight years ago (and are not detained) - and who are only now having their protection applications processed. While the Minister for Immigration recently suggested that the asylum seekers themselves are in some way to blame for the delay in processing, the delay was in fact due solely to the Department’s reluctance to process asylum applications alleging persecution on the part of Indonesia, with whom Australia had a delicate political and diplomatic relationship. Most of these 1600 people had strong refugee claims at the time they lodged their applications; most are now being refused protection due to the changed political landscape in East Timor. Despite the devastating impact that such treatment has had on these people, who have had to try to establish new lives in a state of limbo, they are the lucky ones compared to the Hazara Afghanis who have been detained in the middle of the desert for up to three years, while the government plays political games with their lives. This, more than anything, perhaps reveals the true purpose of detention - the punishment of people for coming here in an ‘unorderly fashion’. As one commentator has put it, it is not the asylum seekers but Australian government that is seeking to achieve a migration outcome. The UK approach to detention - Saadi’s case NAMU’s case forms a stark contrast to the UK approach, as highlighted in Saadi’s case, decided in 2001. Saadi’s case challenged the UK policy of mandatory detention of all asylum seekers whose claims were, amongst other things, likely to be straightforward - that is, unfounded. Under that policy, a ‘fast track’ procedure was instituted where people were detained for a maximum of ten days to speedily resolve their claims. Mr Saadi and three other Iraqi Kurds who were applying to the UK for asylum were detained in the Oakington centre for a period of ten days under the regime in 2000. They brought a challenge to their detention, claiming that they had been unlawfully detained. Collins J held that detention regime was lawful according to domestic law, because it was done in accordance with the requirements of the UK Immigration Act. But he held that their detention was in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which protects liberty and prohibits detention except in specified situations. The decision of Collins J was, however, overturned on appeal and the regime was held to be lawful. Importantly, though, the judges on appeal held that there was a requirement of proportionality between the detention and the purpose, which in this case was to process their applications speedily. In this case detaining someone for ten days was held to be proportionate. Whether the detention of people like the ‘NAMU’ family for a period of three years would be considered proportionate under the ECHR is another question! The differences in approach of the British courts in Saadi and the High Court of Australia in Lim can in large part be explained by the different status of the relevant international conventions in the UK and Australia. Like Australia, international law is not directly enforceable in the UK unless it has been incorporated into UK law. Importantly, the ECHR has been incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998, unlike the ICCPR which, as we have outlined, is not directly enforceable in Australia. For this reason Mr Saadi and the other Iraqis were able to rely on the provisions of the ECHR and were not confined to arguing about the legality of the regime under domestic law. <b>Just</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> the UK parliament has been engaged in heated debate over amendments to its Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill (2002) which will extend the number of ‘accommodation’ - read, detention - centres used in the UK. It even proposed the use of remote facilities (perhaps the UK could rent a desert facility from Australia!) but this proposal seems to have been defeated. Under the new regime, asylum seekers in the UK will be allowed to leave accommodation centres after six months if their applications have not been processed. While this represents a significant hardening of the UK position on asylum seekers, it makes plain the glaring inadequacies in the Australian system, particularly the absence of safeguards against prolonged and indefinite detention. Conclusion The right not to be arbitrarily detained has its origins in the birth of liberalism. It is also a fundamental human right protected by international conventions. It is clear, however, that the Australian government remains blind to the demands of international human rights law, revealing the impotence of non-enforceable norms. What that means for human rights advocates in Australia - and for asylum seekers in detention - is that the battlefield is not the international arena, but the domestic legal system. Whilst Lim’s case upheld the power of the government to place unauthorised arrivals into administrative detention, it did set some limits on that power, and the recent Federal Court cases are examples of this. Despite significant legislative and policy changes, Lim’s case has not been seriously reconsidered by the High Court. The cases currently before the Federal...|$|E
