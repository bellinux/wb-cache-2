In 1980 he made his last film appearance, and his only role on the big screen, acting in Ismail Soebardjo's Perempuan dalam Pasungan (Woman <b>in</b> <b>Stocks).</b> He and Sofia WD portrayed parents who regularly put their daughter <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> to punish her for being disobedient; {{in an interview with}} Suara Karya, Soebardjo recalled that, from the time he had written it, he had only considered Djajakusuma for the role.

In 1983 Djajakusuma served as dean of the Faculty of Arts at IKJ, and in 1984 he went to the Three Continents Festival in Nantes, France, where two of his films were shown to critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|SV40 {{was found}} to be present <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> of the {{injected}} form of the polio vaccine (IPV) in use between 1955 and 1963. It is not found in the OPV form. Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; {{it has been estimated that}} 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40. Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated; meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.|$|E

Apart from The Story of Yue Fei and Iron Arm, Golden Sabre, he appears in a novel based around his older martial arts brother, Jin Tai. A recent graphic novel of The Story of Yue Fei, deletes all mythological elements from the storyline and presents it in a historical manner. Instead of traveling from Hebei to Hubei to inspect land, Zhou travels from Shaanxi to Kaifeng City in Henan to visit an old friend who had been promoted to General. While {{en route to the}} capital city, Zhou takes note of a great famine plaguing the peasantry and even hears stories of some people resorting to Cannibalism. However, when he arrives in Kaifeng, he sees the empire is wasting money on the construction of large imperial gardens, the court officials Cai Jing and Wang Pu have extravagant residencies, and hears that even eunuchs are rich because they are given high government posts. Upon locating his friend, Zhou is distressed to find him <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> and shackles and being escorted to the farthest reaches of China by imperial guards. He later learns that the General had accidentally offended some court officials and was sentenced to permanent exile on some trumped up charges. Apparently having little or no money, Zhou decides to visit Wang Ming in Hubei (mistakenly called Hebei) and becomes the estate's tutor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} mean reversion <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> prices for longterm investors such as pension funds.

Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and show how mean reversion <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> prices affects such an investor’s optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors...|$|R
