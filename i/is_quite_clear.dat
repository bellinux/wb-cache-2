By {{comparing}} it to the Remington M1867, which was the standard issue rifle in the Norwegian Army, as well as against the standard service rifles of Germany, France and the United Kingdom at the time, it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> that the Krag–Petersson suffered from having been designed for an outdated cartridge.|$|E
25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, {{a member of an}} elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> that he was not a racist but rather a man who knew how to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E

25|$|In 1889, Theo Wangemann, a {{representative}} of the American inventor Thomas Edison, visited the composer in Vienna and invited him to make an experimental recording. Brahms played an abbreviated version of his first Hungarian Dance and of Josef Strauss's Die Libelle on the piano. Although the spoken introduction to the short piece of music <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear,</b> the piano playing is largely inaudible due to heavy surface noise. In the same year, Brahms was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg, until 1948 the only one born in Hamburg.|$|E
25|$|Chad {{was invited}} then to become {{bishop of the}} Northumbrians by King Oswiu. Chad is often listed as a Bishop of York. Bede {{generally}} uses ethnic, not geographical, designations for Chad and other early Anglo-Saxon bishops. However at this point, he does also refer to Oswiu's desire that Chad become bishop {{of the church in}} York. York later became the diocesan city partly because it had already been designated as such in the earlier Roman-sponsored mission of Paulinus to Deira, so {{it is not clear whether}} Bede is simply echoing the practice of his own day, or whether Oswiu and Chad were considering a territorial basis and a see for his episcopate. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> that Oswiu intended Chad to be bishop over the entire Northumbrian people, over-riding the claims of both Wilfrid and Eata.|$|E
25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just {{take the money and}} call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{authors have}} prostitutes talking about themselves: Lucian in his Dialogue of courtesans or Alciphron in his {{collection}} of letters; but these are works of fiction. The prostitutes of concern here are either independent or hetaera: the sources here do not concern themselves with the situation of slave-prostitutes, except to consider them {{as a source of}} profit. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> what ancient Greek men thought of prostitutes: primarily, they are reproached for the commercial nature of the activity. The greed of prostitutes is a running theme in Greek comedy. The fact that prostitutes were the only Athenian women who handled money likely increased male acrimony. An explanation for their behavior is that a prostitute's career tended to be short, and their income decreased with the passage of time: a young and pretty prostitute, across all levels of the trade, could earn more money than her older, less attractive colleagues. To provide for old age, they thus had to acquire as much money as possible in a limited period of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{influence from}} the East is strangely {{shown in the}} fashion of decorating external brick walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are set up {{so as to make}} bands of ornamentation which it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion was associated with the disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of the Roman variety. The window and door frames were of marble. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by mosaics or frescoes in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were opened out so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern resembling somewhat the marking of skins of beasts.|$|E
25|$|AC/DC {{is often}} cited as being Australia's {{foremost}} hard rock band. AC/DC's influence on metal <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> however, with a style built around a predominately loud, heavy riffing guitar sound. With regard to heavy metal, Sydney band Buffalo could well be {{considered one of the}} country’s first exponents of the style. Originally formed under the name Head in 1967, Buffalo began playing a very similar style to that of Black Sabbath from 1970. The band was the first non-British act to be signed to Vertigo and released three albums with them between 1972 and 1975 but never found mainstream success in Australia. The group's bass guitarist Peter Wells formed Rose Tattoo in 1976, another band often cited as laying a cornerstone for Australian metal. Like Buffalo, Rose Tattoo’s music was ignored by Australian radio while building a strong cult following internationally. Conversely, The Angels always courted commercial success in Australia while finding progress tougher overseas. The Angels were probably closer to metal than Rose Tattoo, with the albums Night Attack, Watch The Red and Two Minute Warning harbouring a distinctly heavy metal sound, yet while all three charted highly (Two Minute Warning peaked at No.2), none of their singles reached higher than No.21 ("Stand Up", 1982). The Angels were rarely referred to as a heavy metal band in Australia however, and in the modern context would possibly not now be considered one.|$|E

FIA president Max Mosley stated [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> that the result of the race was not fixed.

500|$|Other than {{mentioning}} that {{he carried a}} pocket chronometer by French which gave good results, Stokes' account of the voyage does not list or even enumerate the chronometers. [...] It may be that chronometers were now so commonplace that their use was no longer something of note. [...] However it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> that the chronometers remained {{a key part of}} the mission; frequent stops were made throughout the voyage to check the rates. On 7 December 1839 Stokes went ashore at Point Pearce near the mouth of Victoria River to make observations. Even though he knew the indigenous Australians could be dangerous, he left behind his gun to more safely carry a chronometer. [...] While separated, Stokes was pursued by a group of Australians, one of whom pierced Stokes' chest cavity with a spear throw. Despite his wounds and profuse bleeding, Stokes considered the chronometer to be valuable enough to save; he carried it while he staggered back to his comrades barely able to walk and still being pursued by his attackers.|$|E
