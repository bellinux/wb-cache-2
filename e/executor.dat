500|$|The <b>executors</b> {{claimed that}} Cossa had {{revealed}} {{his desire for}} burial in the Baptistry to them but had been too modest to request it in his will.

40|$|Status and {{activity}} of private <b>executors</b> The theme of execution and institution of private <b>executors</b> {{is still very}} actual nowadays. Partly {{this is due to}} enforcement of adjudications by courts lurking in the time when our law provides another possibility to settle a claim by private <b>executors</b> and partly this is caused by last amendments to our legal regulations of executions and <b>executors.</b> One of the important state's tasks besides finding the law between parties which are in dispute is to assure that admission of plaintiff's demand will be realized. The state provides two ways to obtain this claim in Czech Republic. This system is primarily based on the state courts, but inefficiency and disadvantages of this system led in the year 2001 to new legal regulation which brought institution of private <b>executors</b> to our law. Henceforth, everybody can choose how to achieve fulfilment of judgment debt. The new system of private <b>executors</b> is more efficient and flexible, which mean that particular cases are solved out in shorter time with identical or even preferable result as by enforcement of judgment by court. For this reason more and more people avail oneself of the services of private <b>executors.</b> State delegates a part of its authority to <b>executors</b> who exercise the executions as a business activity, so they are [...] ...|$|R

She leads the golden armada against Artanis's forces, who holds them out {{long enough for the}} Keystone to break them free from Amon's control. Under Artanis's urging, Selendis severs her nerve cord and urges her fellow templar to sever their cords as well, permanently freeing them from Amon's grasp.|$|E

So, <b>executors</b> obtain a grant of probate that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a grant of administration that lets them do the same. Apart from that distinction, the function of <b>executors</b> and administrators is exactly the same.|$|R
5|$|Słowacki's {{tombstone}} at Montmartre {{was designed}} by his friend and <b>executor</b> of his last will, painter Charles Pétiniaud-Dubos; it did not weather {{the passage of time}} well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in place, this one designed by Polish sculptor Władysław Oleszczyński. In 1927 Słowacki's remains were moved to Wawel Cathedral in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{supported}} Guy's claim, but Ubaldo, Archbishop of Pisa, Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, and Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, supported Conrad.

He wrote his will shortly before his death, and died surrounded by his followers on the crusade. Hubert Walter assumed {{the leadership of the}} English forces, and also became Baldwin's <b>executor.</b> Walter paid the wages of some soldiers and knights from Baldwin's estate, and distributed {{the rest of the money}} to the poor.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary <b>executor,</b> he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E
