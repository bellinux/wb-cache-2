5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> aground, {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage.

After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and {{served at the}} Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> back to the Nashville Pike and its final line of defense. He was promoted to major general on December 13.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own car and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 13 January 1797 {{was a minor}} naval battle fought {{between a}} French ship {{of the line and}} two British frigates off the coast of Brittany during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French vessel and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> onto shore in heavy seas, {{resulting}} in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a lee shore.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|After the mutineers sought {{asylum in}} Constanța, Romania, {{and after the}} Russians {{recovered}} the ship, its name was changed to Panteleimon. It accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when it ran aground in 1911. During World War I, Panteleimon participated in the Battle of Cape Sarych in late 1914. It covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915, including one where it was attacked by the Turkish battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim – Panteleimon and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> off before it could inflict any serious damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915. It was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} {{between the}} North Koreans and the ROK Capital Division {{on the hills}} bordering the valley from An'gang-ni to Kyongju. The 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, became involved there just after midnight on September 8–9. A North Korean force attacked K Company and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> from Hill 300, a defensive position midway between An'gang-ni and Kyongju. North Koreans held the hill during September 9 against counterattack. Farther north, {{on the left side}} of the valley, the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and, with the support of the US 13th Field Artillery Battalion, captured Hill 285 and held it against several North Korean counterattacks. On the opposite, east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains. These battles took place in drenching typhoon rains. Low-hanging clouds allowed very little air support. The rains finally ceased on September 10.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E

Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> out of Marietta.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> out of the arena to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> across Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the Fringe in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's hi-tech dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E

5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, a British {{squadron}} sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling {{to the west and}} gave chase, Captain Laforey leading in the 38-gun , followed by the bomb vessel , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald, and the 12-gun cutter , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett. Discovering the British in pursuit, Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore, tacking in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range. Laforey continued his approach, and a 06:00 successfully tacked Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve, which had turned back towards the shore. Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships, their attacks had little impact. Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore, pursued by Vesuvius and Trial. Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante, which was attempting to turn back towards Le Havre. The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> ashore near the mouth of the Dives River.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Wall was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. The Berlin Wall stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of the Berlin Wall in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of the Berlin Wall reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to the Berlin Wall, as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that the Berlin Wall received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit the Berlin Wall, which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E

5|$|The two armies met on {{the large}} plain of al-Mudiq (cf. Qalaat al-Madiq), {{surrounded}} by mountains and located near the Lake of Apamea, on 19 July 998. According to Ibn al-Qalanisi, the Fatimid army's left wing was commanded by Maysur the Slav, governor of Tripoli; the centre, where the Daylamite infantry and the army baggage train were located, was {{under the command of}} Badr al-Attar; the right was commanded by Jaysh ibn Samsama and Wahid al-Hilali. According to all accounts, the Byzantines charged the Fatimid army and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> to flight, killing some 2,000 and capturing the baggage train. Only 500 ghilman under Bishara the Ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against the assault, while the Banu Kilab simply abandoned the fight and began looting the battlefield. At that point, a Kurdish rider, named Abu'l-Hajar Ahmad ibn al-Dahhak al-Salil by Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Qalanisi and Bar Kefa by the Byzantine sources and Abu'l-Faraj, rode towards Dalassenos, who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue. Believing the battle won and that the Kurd wanted to surrender, Dalassenos took no precautions. As he approached the Byzantine general, Ibn al-Dahhak suddenly charged. Dalassenos lifted his arm to shield himself, but the Kurd launched his spear at him. The general wore no cuirass, and the blow killed him.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and <b>drove</b> <b>it</b> to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
