During and after flooding along the Columbia River in 1948 the Hillsboro facility was used by some commercial operators due to the closure of then Portland-Columbia Airport (now Portland International), which lies along the river. The three commercial carriers at Hillsboro were Coastal Airways, Columbia Air Cargo, and <b>General</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Cargo.</b> This was the flooding that wiped out the city of Vanport, and due to that disaster relief supplies were flown into the Portland area by the United States Air Force using the Hillsboro Airport.|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>cargo</b> {{carriers}} used to 'own' the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> business. For over {{a decade}} though, the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> carriers' market share has been growing at lower rates than the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> market itself. Despite these difficulties and IATA's efforts to simplify <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> processes by introducing electronic documentation, most shipments are still accompanied by printed documents - up to 30 and more per shipment. It {{is the purpose of}} the research to analyse the dynamics of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system, which lead to the challenges the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry is currently faced with. It is analysed, which role the various players of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system and its environment play and who is driving developments in the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry. Furthermore it is reflected, to what extent ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), namely electronic documentation for <b>air</b> <b>cargo,</b> impact the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system’s dynamics and whether they can contribute to strengthen the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry again. Based on a historic review the main players of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system are identified and the development of their role is described in a first step. Applying a systems theoretic approach the dynamics of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system are reflected. This analysis reveals that, whilst there is information available regarding the structures of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system's environment, very little is known regarding the structures within the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system itself and between its players: the freight forwarders, the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> carriers and the handling agents. In order to close this research gap, in a second empirical step, structured expert interviews with key players of the entire <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system (freight forwarders, handling agents, <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> carriers, shippers and consignees, IT providers, IATA, customs) were held. Based on these interviews dynamics within the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system are reflected and the impact of electronic documentation on these structures is analysed. The research shows that the use of ICT and particularly electronic documentation are a necessary, but not sufficient step for rendering <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> profitable again. Instead, it is essential for the players within the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> system to redefine their own role as well as their mode of cooperation and communication...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Asia {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing regions within the global air {{transport}} market. Since the 1990 s, <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> volumes in the region have increased dramatically. In response to such trends, many Asian countries have opened new airports or expanded existing <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> facilities to accommodate more cargo and to be developed as a regional air logistics hub. Although <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> accounts for only 0. 3 % by weight of all cargo traded by Korea, its value share was much higher at more than 30 %. The interests in developing Korea’s <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry arise due to the fast growth of the sector, and to the push by shippers and traders, and freight carriers. This paper presents an analysis of the development of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry in Korea. The characteristics and trends of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry in Korea and Northeast Asia are assessed. To identify current situation and facing problems of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry, several factors such as geographical location, costs, infrastructures, customs, and air transport policies are reviewed. The analysis includes various role players such as shippers, forwarders, airlines, customs office, airport authorities, and government. Some other issues included in this paper are <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> information system for efficient <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> business, sea-&-air transport, and express cargo transport, etc. Finally, this study suggests some policy implications for the development of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry in the region for the 21 st century.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalA {{substantial}} {{challenge to}} reducing security {{gaps in the}} international <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> supply chain {{is the lack of}} a method of evaluating existing levels of risk based upon points of origin, points of departure and cargo and aircraft type.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> demand {{is based on the}} application of a system engineering technique which includes 12 conditional factors. Firstly the intercontinental trade, the latest development of logistics and the influences of the changes in prices and the supply of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> transport are explained in detail. During the next step the reciprocal influence of each of the factors is discussed separately and formally interpreted. As a result a formal method to estimate the volume and the composition of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> demand is developed. The description of the rudiments of the organisation of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> supply includes an explanation of the principal settings of the market. Apart from the segmentation of the supply into three different levels of quality, an approach to assess the individual features of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> supply is proposed. Following this the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> volume of all European airports is systematically analysed. First the belly volume of passenger aircraft is observed, distinguishing the intercontinental and the continental volume. Moreover the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> transport on board of all-cargo aircraft counted at European airports is analysed. From this a formal model to explain the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> volume of an individual airport is evolved. This is based on the premise of widely liberal terms of competition within the air cargo-market and takes into account the Western European conditions. The <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> supply is modelled analogous to the basic conditions of the decision making process of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry. The suitability of the model for forecating is derived from ist application at the Munich airport. For the first time it is possible to consider the full variety of all conditional factors of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> volume systematically. It can thus be concluded that the supply of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> industry finally determines the volume and the structure of the <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> of an airport.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the price and}} income elasticities of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> demand and examines how they may change after the 2008 financial crisis. Using a set of time series data, we simultaneously estimate the aggregated demand and supply functions of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). We find that during the entire sampling period of 2001 - 2013, the price elasticity for <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> transport demand at HKIA ranges from - 0. 74 to - 0. 29, suggesting that <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> demand in Hong Kong reacts negatively to price (as expected) but {{does not appear to}} be very sensitive to price. The income elasticity ranges from 0. 29 to 1. 47 and appears sensitive to seasonality adjustment approaches. However, in terms of the speed of changes, <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> demand changes much faster than overall economy, indicating the presence of a pro-cyclical pattern of <b>air</b> <b>cargo</b> traffic with respect to the overall economy.
