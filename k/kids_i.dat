Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at <b>kids.</b> <b>I</b> was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience.

500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time. Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the <b>kids</b> <b>I</b> grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

500|$|Two songs {{taken from}} the album ("Mandatory Suicide" [...] and [...] "South of Heaven") have become near {{constant}} fixtures in the band's live setlist, notching up appearances on the following: the live DVDs Live Intrusion, War at the Warfield, Still Reigning, Soundtrack to the Apocalypses deluxe edition's bonus live disc, and the live double album Decade of Aggression. [...] Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described [...] "South of Heaven" [...] as [...] "an unorthodox set opener in theory", noting [...] "the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, {{leading up to the}} slowly building crescendo" [...] in a concert review. Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and thinking, Man! There's just so much groove in that song.' To my <b>kids</b> <b>I</b> was saying, 'Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!' And it's heavy."

500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers <b>kids).</b> <b>I</b> would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my <b>kids.</b> <b>I</b> had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my <b>kids,</b> <b>I</b> started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E

The chorus is actually every member of the band singing. Newman stated, [...] "I like the fact that people think that it's a kids' group... We made ourselves sound like a giant group, but we ended up sounding like little <b>kids.</b> <b>I</b> love {{the fact that in the}} Rolling Stone review they mention the chorus of <b>kids.</b> <b>I</b> just think it's great that people actually believe that, because it's such a fucking ridiculous thing for a band to do." ...|$|E
