40|$|Ikan Sidat or eel fish (Anguilla bicolor) is {{a popular}} fish {{commodity}} in domestic trade {{as well as for}} export commodity. The use of marine yeast as fodder suffers from some weaknesses since it contains nucleic acids and rigid thick cell walls that obstruct the absorbance of nutrition. Optimizing the use of marine yeast as fodder ingredients can be done by fragmenting and reducing the yeast. This research attempts at optimizing the use of marine yeast regarding its rate of growth, <b>fodder</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the survival rate of eel fish. This research employs the complete random design using 4 different treatments and 3 repetition. In the four treatments, the fodder contained protein (45 %) and iso energy (3. 600 kkal. kg- 1 fodder), which were applied to the treatment A 0 % (control), B 5 % (complete), C 5 % (fragmented) and D 5 % (reduced). The parameters used in this study were survival rate, specific growth rate, ratio of fodder conversion, ratio of protein efficiency, energy retention, protein retention and rate of metabolism. The data of this study showed the best result in the treatment D, 5 % (reduced), showing survival rate value of 95. 56 %, specific growth at 1. 12, food conversion ratio of 2. 27, protein efficiency ratio of 0. 98, protein retention at 18. 26 %, energy retention of 16. 57, and protein metabolism rate at 81. 96 %...|$|E
40|$|Efficient use of feed {{resources}} {{is a challenge}} in the pork industry because the largest variability in expenditure is attributed {{to the cost of}} <b>fodder.</b> <b>Efficiency</b> of feeding is directly related to feeding behavior. In order to identify genomic regions controlling feeding behavior and eating efficiency traits, 338 Duroc boars were used in this study. The Illumina Porcine SNP 60 K BeadChip was used for genotyping. Data pertaining to individual daily feed intake (DFI), total daily time spent in feeder (TPD), number of daily visits to feeder (NVD), average duration of each visit (TPV), mean feed intake per visit (FPV), mean feed intake rate (FR), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were collected for these pigs. Despite the limited sample size, the genome-wide association study was acceptable to detect candidate regions association with feeding behavior and eating efficiency traits in pigs. We detected three genome-wide (P < 1. 40 E- 06) and 11 suggestive (P < 2. 79 E- 05) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -trait associations. Six SNPs were located in genomic regions where quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have previously been reported for feeding behavior and eating efficiency traits in pigs. Five candidate genes (SERPINA 3, MYC, LEF 1, PITX 2, and MAP 3 K 14) with biochemical and physiological roles that were relevant to feeding behavior and eating efficiency were discovered proximal to significant or suggestive markers. Gene ontology analysis indicated that most of the candidate genes were involved {{in the development of the}} hypothalamus (GO: 0021854, P < 0. 0398). Our results provide new insights into the genetic basis of feeding behavior and eating efficiency in pigs. Furthermore, some significant SNPs identified in this study could be incorporated into artificial selection programs for Duroc-related pigs to select for increased feeding efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The aimed of {{this work}} was to {{comparing}} the drying process in a microwave oven and forced air ventilation, {{as well as their}} effects on the chemical composition of different genotypes of the genus Cynodon (Tifton 85, Jiggs, Russell, Tifton 68 and Vaquero) collected at different ages cutting (28, 48, 63 and 79 days). The experimental design was a randomized block in a split-plot design, with 4 replicates. There was no difference (P> 0. 05) between the methods analyzed on the chemical composition of the genotypes studied. Increasing age cutoff negatively influenced (P< 0. 05) the crude protein content of the different plant parts. A significant increase (P< 0. 05) of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and dry matter production was observed with increasing age cut. The use of the microwave oven is a quick and precise method obtain the dry matter content of the <b>fodder</b> showing <b>efficiency</b> similar to the method of drying in an oven with forced air circulation. The genotypes showed better chemical composition results when handled at age 28 days. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in reliable and practical methods to sequester carbon (C) into agricultural soils to both reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and improve conventional productivity. This article outlines a research methodology {{to refine the}} efficacy and economics of using long-lived C species (biochars) as stock feed additives, produced from farm waste biomass, for ecologically delivered soil biosequestration, while generating renewable bioenergy. This article also draws attention to potential parallel outputs including annual feed use <b>efficiency,</b> <b>fodder</b> species expansion, soil nutrient retention, aquatic habitat protection, and forestry revegetation, using nitrogen-fixing perennial fodder plant species. A methodology to generate parallel results including standing fodder tree C sequestration, optimised production of Acacia spp. biochar, animal growth on high-tannin fodder with biochar feed additives, soil nutrient and stable C fractions, and economics of Acacia spp. bioenergy production. This form of research is contextually dependent on the regional agricultural production system, legislation, and surrounding ecosystem. Therefore, this article suggests {{the use of a}} scenario approach to include regionally specific levels of biochar integration with respect to the local prices for C, fossil fuels, meat and livestock, fertilisers, fodder, feed additives, water, renewable energy, revegetation and capital...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:Environmental pollution; Acidification; Global warming; Agriculture; Abatement cost; Environmental policy interrelations; Ammonia; Nitrous Oxide; MethaneAgriculture is an {{important}} source of ammonia, contributing to acidification and eutrophication, as well as emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane. Technical measures to control emissions of one of these pollutants may have an impact on emissions of others. These side effects, which may be positive or negative, are usually ignored in policy-making. This study investigates interrelations in emission reduction strategies for ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane from agricultural activities in Europe and analyses their impact on cost-effective emission reduction strategies. It presents a modelling framework to identify cost-effective strategies for simultaneous reductions in emissions of various pollutants, considering interrelations. The model includes emissions from various sources and atmospheric transport from the location of emissions to the location where the environmental effect occurs. Emissions can be reduced by several abatement options. The effects of these options, including side effects on emissions of various pollutants, are explicitly incorporated in the model. The model was used for an empirical analysis of interrelations in reducing ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector. In many countries, cost-effective ammonia abatement was found to result in an increase in nitrous oxide emissions. This was caused by measures that effectively reduce ammonia emissions but have adverse side effects on nitrous oxide, such as low ammonia application of manure and animal housing systems with low ammonia emissions. The results also indicated that several measures to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions, such as a lower nitrogen content in the <b>fodder,</b> improved fertiliser <b>efficiency</b> and feed additives improving animal productivity in milk and growth, simultaneously reduce ammonia emissions. Furthermore, the model was used to identify cost-effective emission reduction strategies to achieve geographically specific targets for nitrogen and sulphur deposition, contributing to acidification and eutrophication, combined with reduction targets for nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector, considering the interrelations in reducing emissions from the agricultural sector. The results indicated that cost savings can be obtained when interrelations are considered, because measures with harmful side effects are substituted with measures with beneficial side effects...|$|R
