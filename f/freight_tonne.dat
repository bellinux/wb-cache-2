40|$|Construction of the LEeds Freight Transport Model (LEFT) {{series was}} begun {{as part of}} the ITeLS project, {{although}} other funding has helped and will take forward its development. The initial version, now referred to by us as LEFT 1, was a simple mode split model intended to give a rough idea of the magnitudes of the effects of various scenarios, possibly as a way of filtering which scenarios might be investigated using more detailed models. Besides being limited to mode split, LEFT 1 suffered from a range of minor defects and deficiencies which led to its abandonment in favour of its successor, LEFT 2. LEFT 2 was constructed in 2004 {{as part of the}} Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council LINK FIT project, ITeLS, funded by the Department for Transport (DfT). We acknowledge here the help and useful comments from many persons associated with that project. Besides mode split effects, LEFT 2 allows scenarios to alter the total size of the (road plus rail) market. Its purpose is to provide instantaneous ballpark estimates of road and rail <b>freight</b> <b>tonne</b> kilometres under various ‘scenarios’. At its base is a desire that the scenarios should not affect the sum of tonnes moved by both road and rail modes. This was because we felt that our scenarios should be viewed as having a neutral macroeconomic effect. For example, if taxes on lorry usage were increased, we would expect other taxes to be lower than otherwise (or government spending to increase) so that total demand in the economy would not change. Consumers might buy their goods from closer sources than hitherto, but they would not be expected to consume less in total. For example, if prices of some goods rose slightly due to higher road user charges, the consumer would have more to spend due to offsetting reduced income tax (or whatever) and much the same total quantity would be bought. Similarly, industrialists as a whole might find input prices increasing slightly, but will find they can charge slightly more for their outputs. In summary, LEFT 2 provides an instantaneous estimate of the effect of macroeconomically neutral scenarios on mode split (road, trainload and wagonload), average length of haul and total market size. LEFT 2 does not load the traffic onto vehicles, and so does not produce magnitudes of HGV vehicle kilometres, for instance. Consequently it does not produce estimates of emissions or other nuisances. It is hoped that a future version of LEFT can incorporate these elements and revisit the other matters that have had to be ‘parked’ for the present. LEFT 2 gives a quick idea of the magnitudes of the effects of any policies that might be considered and should help to provide a first sift where many policies are being considered. This report describes the basic LEFT Methodology in Section 2. Emphasis is given to that methodology actually embodied in LEFT 2, but there is also some discussion of rejected 4 methodologies, and some that have had to be held over for later versions of LEFT. Section 3 presents additional data that was needed by the LEFT 2 model. Section 4 describes the scenarios chosen for testing in the ITeLS project, while section 5 gives the first results from using the LEFT 2 model, for those scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Freight demand {{elasticity}} studies vary {{significantly in}} terms of the demand measure, data type, estimation method, commodity type, etc. This wide variation makes it difficult to compare empirical estimates when the differences may arise in part from the methods and data used. In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis to identify systematic sources of influence on direct price elasticity estimates in the context of freight transport, distinguishing between road, rail, and sea transport, using published direct price elasticities from 12 elasticity-derivative studies from five countries. The study focuses on revealed preference elasticities defined by the <b>freight</b> rate for <b>tonnes</b> and tonne kilometres of inter-city freight movements. Systematic sources that explain differences in direct price elasticities include the demand elasticity measure, mode, commodity class, model estimation form, country, and temporal nature of data (e. g., cross-section). Analysts can utilise the model outputs to adjust the empirical evidence from specific studies to control for differences that impact on the behavioural implications of comparative evidence.

The observed decoupling of road freight traffic growth from economic growth is mainly the result of use of larger vehicles, increasing average loads, and less empty running.

40|$|Wheel tread defects, such as wheel flats, {{generate}} wheel–rail {{impact loads}} that in severe cases may promote fracture from pre-existing {{cracks in the}} rail. The present Swedish wheel removal criterion relates the alarm limit to the size (length) of a wheel flat. This is not an optimal situation since it may be both difficult and dangerous to locate and measure {{the length of a}} wheel flat. Further, a given size of a wheel flat will result in different impact loads if present on different types of vehicles due to differences in train speed, axle load, etc, and on different tracks with differences in track properties. In this study, the influence of wheel–rail impact load magnitude on resulting rail bending moment is studied using a numerical model for simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction. Three different types of traffic are investigated: heavy haul at 60 km/h (axle load 30 <b>tonnes),</b> <b>freight</b> at 100 km/h (25 tonnes) and passenger at 200 km/h (21 tonnes). Positive bending moments generating tensional stresses in the rail foot and negative bending moments leading to tensional stresses in the rail head are calculated. The model is calibrated with respect to field measurements. An idealised time history of the impact load due to a wheel flat is suggested, and worst-case scenarios are sought for in parametric studies. It is shown that magnitudes of rail bending moments are significantly influenced by sleeper support stiffness and in particular if adjacent sleepers are not well supported (hung sleepers) ...|$|R
