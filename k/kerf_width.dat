5000|$|A laser guide {{provides}} a precise visual indication {{of where the}} cut will be positioned on the workpiece in the current configuration. Some models provide a single reference line for {{one side of the}} kerf, while others provide two lines to reflect the total <b>kerf</b> <b>width.</b> A blade guard is a cover for the teeth of the cutting blade. Most modern miter saws have self-retracting blade guards, which automatically retract when the saw is lowered onto a workpiece and re-cover the blade when the saw is raised. It is very dangerous to use the saw if these guards are removed or damaged. A dust bag connects directly to the saw, and helps to collect sawdust away from the workpiece during cutting. Optionally, many manufacturers sell adapters to connect an industrial vacuum cleaner in lieu of a bag to capture more of the dust and simplify disposal. Dust removal with these saws is notoriously poor. A safety clamp helps to lock a workpiece into position prior to making a cut. This is an especially important feature when cutting smaller workpieces (eight inches or smaller). The miter table [...] is typically less than 24" [...] in diameter. Typically, the work will need to be supported on the far end to stabilize the piece while cutting.|$|E

The thesis discuss the experimental analysis to predict the effect of the process parameter on <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper on acrylic sheet. The work piece {{that we are going to}} use in the experiment is acrylic sheet that is also known by trade names such as Plexiglas, Acrylite, and Lucite which is commonly used in industry. This material is great for glazing, windows, cutting boards, or anywhere a clear material is needed. Besides that, it is also has better optical clarity than glass, light weight, good impact strength and clear. As mentioned, the experiments is conduct using laser beam cutting machine. The specimen is cut in square shape then a slit is made through the center of specimen to determine the <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper. From the results, it is observed that the parameter set in the experiment on laser beam cutting had effect on <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper. Secondly, the cuffing speed, nozzle gap and laser power gives major impact on <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper. The <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper will increase considerably with the increase of laser power and nozzle gap and decreasing the cutting speed. The cutting angle and air pressure also gives some effect on <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper. Increasing cutting angle and air pressure will slightly increase the <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper. Low value of laser power, nozzle gap, cutting angle, air pressure and higher cutting speed will produce lowest /narrow <b>kerf</b> <b>width</b> and taper which means the finest cutting quality with good width and cut edge is produced...|$|E

30|$|Wire Electrical {{discharge}} machining (WEDM) has higher capability for cutting complex shapes with high precision for very hard materials without using {{high cost of}} cutting tools. During the WEDM process, the wire behaves like a metal string, straightened by two axial pulling forces and deformed laterally by a sum of forces from the discharge process. Major forces acting on the wire can be classified into three categories. The first is a tensile force, pulling the wire from both sides in axial direction and keeping it straight. The second is the dielectric flushing force that comes from circulation of the dielectric fluid in the machining area. The third category consists of forces of different kinds resulting from sparking and discharging. Large amplitude of wire vibration leads to large <b>kerf</b> <b>widths,</b> low shape accuracies, rough machined surfaces, low cutting speeds and high risk of wire breakage. Such tendencies for poor machining performance due to wire instability behavior appear with thinner wires.|$|R

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start <b>kerf</b> <b>widths,</b> and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start <b>kerf</b> <b>widths,</b> and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start <b>kerf</b> <b>widths</b> or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|R

Using taguchi‟s parameter design, significant machining parameters affecting the performance measures are identified as pulse peak current, pulse on time, and duty factor. The effect of each control factor on the performance measure is studied individually using the plots of signal to noise ratio. The study demonstrates that the WEDM process parameters can be adjusted so as to achieve better metal removal rate, surface finish, electrode wear rate...|$|R

This study analyzed the survivorship of cut marks, striations, and metric changes of kerf size associated with burning. There was an expectation that most cut marks would survive the fire, although changes were expected such as that the previous damage to bone would lead to extensive fracturing in the areas of the preexisting trauma. An understanding of how fire affects cut marks on bone is important when attempting to determine a particular class of tool based on cut mark features. Because the use of burning to hinder identification and destroy evidence are common challenges faced by forensic scientists, understanding that fire may change trauma characteristics is important when attempting to draw conclusions about a suspect weapon. With <b>kerf</b> xi <b>width</b> being a criterion for assessing tool class, forensic investigators need to understand that if bone is burned, this method may not be able to be used to eliminate suspect weapons. For the purpose of this study cut marks were created on pig (Sus scrofa) femora using a cleaver, hand saw, scalpel, and steak knife. From these cut marks, casts were made and then analyzed using a digital microscope. The total number of cut marks present on each bone was noted, and widths were taken at three intervals along the length of each cut mark. Once casted, the pig femora were burned in a controlled building fire for approximately 45 minutes with the temperature ranging from 277. 3 ??C- 1, 096 ??C. The surviving cut marks were casted again. The results from this study were quite variable between the different tools. With only 47. 2 percent of the cut marks surviving the fire, the bone with cut marks created by the cleaver demonstrated extensive fracturing. Survivorship was much higher for the cut marks for the scalpel (68. 8...|$|R
