[...] After a stay in England due to {{professional}} success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of New Zealand and China and even appeared on a Chinese talk show. [...] Paxton released <b>How</b> <b>Come</b> <b>the</b> Sun in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, Peace Will Come (1972), barely even reached the charts. [...] He soon returned to New York City and the Long Island town of East Hampton before moving to the Washington, D.C. area around 1977. [...] After recording three albums for Reprise Records and a few for [...] "an English label that didn't pan out well", Paxton signed with Vanguard Records, with whom he recorded a live album with Steve Goodman, New Songs From the Briarpatch (1977), which contained some of Paxton's topical songs of the 1970s, including [...] "Talking Watergate" [...] and [...] "White Bones of Allende" [...] as well as a song dedicated to Mississippi John Hurt entitled [...] "Did You Hear John Hurt?" [...] In 1978, Paxton released his album Heroes, which contained a song, [...] "Phil", about his friend Phil Ochs, who had taken his own life in 1976. [...] The album also includes the song [...] "The Death of Stephen Biko", which details the brutal killing of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko in South Africa.|$|E

5000|$|According to Sontheimer and Kulke, the Yoga-samgrama is an [...] "unusually frank critique" [...] of Hindu Brahmanical {{ritualism}} {{and folk}} Hinduism. While Sheikh Muhammad accepts classical Hindu deities, he vilifies folk Hindu deities. He mocks the shrines of the Hindu mother goddess placed on roads and in fields: [...] "If the deities {{were all that}} powerful, <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>the</b> dogs urinate on them?" [...] He also criticizes self-torture rituals like hook-swinging, performed to appease folk deities. Sheikh Muhammad especially condemned the popular folk god Khandoba and the rituals of his cult. He criticized the practice of muralis, girls offered to Khandoba to serve the god, but who were forced into prostitution. Sheikh Muhammad does not spare Islam and criticizes some of its aspects.|$|E

50|$|One of Groucho's oft-repeated {{stories about}} the film {{concerned}} the gorilla skin that an actor wore. On The Dick Cavett Show in 1969, {{he said that the}} actor was too hot inside the skin under the bright lights, and it was summer, and during lunch he went to the cafeteria and poked several holes in it with an icepick. The manager of the gorilla skin became angry about this and took the skin away. MGM scoured southern California for a replacement and finally located an orangutan skin in San Diego. An orangutan is only half the size of a gorilla, and they had to hire a midget to fit inside it. Groucho said he got hundreds of letters about this, and some viewers he happened to meet asked him <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>the</b> gorilla got smaller in the second half.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 September, {{just hours}} after the second {{explosion}} in Moscow, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov of the Communist Party made an announcement, [...] "I have just received a report. According to information from Rostov-on-Don, an apartment building {{in the city of}} Volgodonsk was blown up last night." [...] However, the bombing in Volgodonsk took place three days later, on 16 September. When the Volgodonsk bombing happened, Vladimir Zhirinovsky demanded an explanation in the Duma, but Seleznev turned his microphone off. Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in the Russian Duma: [...] "Remember, Gennadiy Nikolaevich, how you told us that a house has been blown up in Volgodonsk, three days prior to the blast? How should we interpret this? The State Duma knows that the house was destroyed on Monday, and it has indeed been blown up on Thursday week... <b>How</b> <b>come...</b> <b>the</b> state authorities of Rostov region were not warned in advance the future bombing, although it was reported to us?

5000|$|He {{viewed the}} ether (the atmosphere, the open space) {{as a place}} where the {{thoughts}} people have can often be felt or received as what we often name [...] "vibes" [...] or hunches. That's <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>the</b> author wrote about the idea that thoughts become things and are not just lost, but become material or things. Like the law of physics which says that all matter is transformed into something else and not just dissipated. He wrote in one of his books that the thoughts we have are released into the atmosphere and others as well as us individually might be able to tap into them and receive them as hunches or simply a guess about whatever. The same way that a scientist will often get an idea about something and write a hypothesis to be proved or disapproved using the scientific method. [...] So the term Infinite intelligence is not a top secret or any thing like that; it’s just a more acceptable term often in the world of writers and publishers and book sellers and maybe book buyers, too, chosen by American Attorney Napoleon Hill when he wrote his books about Individual Achievement commissioned to him by Andrew Carnegie. Using the term infinite intelligence, he appealed to a wider audience of readers and to more people within various population segments. [...] Tuesday, August 07, 2007 ...|$|E

50|$|Prof. Jha wrote {{some stories}} {{out of sheer}} fun and for his own delight, taking a holiday, as it were, from the {{seriousness}} of satire and social criticism. They are remarkable for his inventive power and his capacity for creating something highly enjoyable out of nothing. These are trick stories, stories of ingenuity and verbal playfulness. In this category we can place such stories as Totama (A Cure for Hiccup), Kalibarik Chor (The Thief of Kalibari), Darogajik Monchh (Darogaji’s Moustache), Alankar Siksha (A Lesson in Rhetoric) and Pressak Leela (Printer’s Devil). In Totama and Kalibarik Chor we have two memorable trick stories that keep us glued to the text till the very end. The crescendo of suspense that ultimately leads to an anti-climax has been so well maintained that it keeps us on tenterhooks forcing us to jump ahead to the conclusion. The beauty and originality of Darogajik Monchh lie in the dexterously drafted letter which gives one meaning when read in part and a completely opposite meaning when read in full. In our enjoyment of the story we do not question <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>the</b> letter which was torn in frustration had two exactly equal halves. Pressak Leela is a hilarious description of how the printer’s devil made an estate Pundit lose his job. An instance of “learning while playing”, Alankar Siksha relies solely on verbal exercise {{and the use of}} prose as a functional medium. A supreme example of verbal humour, it reveals the inventive power of Prof. Jha’s mind in the way a Sanskrit teacher is shown to use a volley of abuses among the women of his house as a textbook to give his disciple a lesson in rhetoric. He gives a practical demonstration of different figures of speech by identifying and explaining every abuse, idiom or proverb hurled {{in the course of the}} wordy quarrel.|$|E

[...] "I am not going to hide the truth any more. When one fetch Hui Spring water one must dig a well, and wait in a silent night for new water to arrive, then bucket it up quickly.

No sooner he uttered this words, out he went. He soon returned with a kettle and pour me a full cup of tea, and said [...] "please try this" [...] "It has an intense aroma and rich taste. Is this spring tea? The one I tasted before was Autumn pick" [...] Vin-sui laughed heartily and said [...] "In seventy years of my life, I have never met a single connoisseur like you!"
