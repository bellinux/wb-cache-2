40|$|Influence {{of stage}} of {{lactation}} and level of milk production on conception rates after timed artificial insemination following Ovsynch It was {{the objective of this}} study to investigate, whether conception rates after timed artificial insemination (TAI), are influenced by the {{stage of lactation}} or the level of milk production. In the experiment 1288 Holstein cows of a commercial dairy herd in Brandenburg, Germany, were used. All cows were examined by palpation of the uterus between 14 and 21 days in milk (DIM) for signs of endometritis. Cows were assigned to two different groups according to final digit of their <b>eartag</b> <b>numbers.</b> Each of the two main groups was subdivided into three categories by production level (high, average, low). Production levels were defined by the average daily milk production of the cows during the 5 th week of lactation. This resulted in 6 subgroups that could be compared, based on their production level or based on the timing of synchronisation in the course of lactation. Classification was done separately for primiparous and multiparous cows to account for expected differences in milk production between the age groups. All cows with uneven <b>eartag</b> <b>numbers</b> were synchronized with Ovsynch for timed artificial insemination (TAI) between 73 and 81 DIM irrespective of their milk production level (Group &# 65533;Simultaneous Ovsynch, SO&# 65533;). The second group (&# 65533;Production Ovsynch, PO&# 65533;) was subdivided into three production classes (i. e. low, average, high) and synchronized at three different stages of lactation, with low producing cows starting early (TAI at 53 to 59 DIM), cows with average production synchronized with Group SO (TAI at 74 to 80 DIM) and cows with high production level starting three weeks after those (TAI at 94 to 102 DIM). The protocol for synchronization was identical for all cows in the trial: Cows were treated with a GnRH analogue (0. 1 mg of D-Phe- 6 -Gonadorelin, Depherelin&# 61666;, Veyx - Pharma GmbH, Schwarzenborn Germany) 10 days before scheduled AI. Prostaglandin F 2 &# 945; (0. 5 mg of cloprostenol, PGF Veyx&# 61666; forte, Veyx - Pharma GmbH, Schwarzenborn, Germany) was administered 7 days later and another 48 hours later cows were re-treated with the GnRH analogue. AI was carried out about 20 hours after the second GnRH treatment. Pregnancy was diagnosed by rectal palpation 42 days post insemination. Endometritis was significantly associated with production level. The proportion of affected animals was higher in cows with low production during the 5 th week post partum (p Production levels were defined during the 5 th week of lactation and were constant throughout the whole lactation. Cows with a low milk level during the 5 th week of lactation, had a low milk level after 305 days in milk. Cows with a high milk level during the 5 th week of lactation, had a high milk level after 305 days in milk. First service conception rates to TAI did not differ between cows of low (34. 5 %), medium (34. 0 %) and high (28. 2 %) milk production levels synchronized {{at the same time in}} the Group 1 &# 65533;Simultaneous Ovsynch&# 65533;. In the Group 2 &# 65533;Production Ovsynch&# 65533;, cows started 3 weeks earlier (low production) than Group 1 had significantly lower first service conception rates to TAI (14. 4 %) and cows synchronized 3 weeks later had significantly higher first service conception rates (41. 4 %) than cows synchronized together with Group 1 (28. 7 %). Low producing cows in Group 1 had significantly higher first service conception rates to TAI than low producing cows in Group 2, that had been synchronized three weeks earlier(34. 5 vs. 14. 4 %). High producing cows in Group 1 had significantly lower first service conception rates than high producing cows in Group 2, that were synchronized 3 weeks later (28. 2 vs. 41. 4 %). Results of this study demonstrate clearly, that stage of lactation has a significant impact on conception rates on TAI in an Ovsynch protocol. On the other hand, production level did not have a significant influence on conception rates. After 200 days in milk in all subgroups the same share of cows were pregnant. That&# 65533;s why the different voluntary waiting periods have had no significant influence on the average days open and of the pregnancy rates by 200 days in milk. The use of the Ovsynch protocol allows an acceptable average time to first artificial insemination. It is not necessary to start very early in lactation with the first artificial insemination. The effect of clinical mastitis of the conception rate after Ovsynch was studied. Cows with a clinical mastitis three weeks before AI and three weeks after AI have had a lower first conception rate after Ovsynch. The number of days to conception for cows with clinical mastitis was seven days greater and they have less milk production. In all different subgroups the costs for each pregnancy was calculated. Dairy cows with the best milk production parameters have had the highest costs per pregnancy. For all production levels it was cost-effective to have more days to first <br /...|$|R
40|$|The carob {{plant is}} {{known from the}} ancient years {{in the region of}} Mediterranean, where its fruit {{constituted}} nutritious food for the people and the animals. The present work constitutes study of efficiency of feed utilization for fattening pigs after the addition of carob. With this study an effort was made to determine the main parameters, with which it is possible to utilize the ration for fattening pigs, after adding to it carob produced in Greece. Thus, in relative experimentation with fattening pigs that began with their weaning and finished with their slaughter, we determined the increase of bodily weight, the consumption of food, the feed conversion ratio, the output of pigs in carcass, the quality of carcass (measuring the fat depth, the content of Weende nutritious substances in carcass), the digestibility of Weende nutritious substances in the ration, the quantification of tannins in carobs, the mortality and the consistency of produced excrements of fattening pigs. For the investigation of efficiency of feed utilization of fattening pigs with the addition of carob in their ration, 4 experimental circles were held with the use of 40 piglets per circle. In each experimental circle 40 weaning piglets were selected and after the placement of <b>numbered</b> <b>eartags</b> on them, they were separated in 4 teams A, B, C and D, each one with 10 piglets (5 males and 5 females) and they constituted subgroups A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, C 1 C 2, C 3, C 4 and D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 in the 4 circles of experimentation, respectively. The genotype of piglets that were selected and used in all circles of experimentation was F 1 generation hybrids from the >Seghers x +Whiteroc. Four types of experimental ration were prepared (A, B, C and D), one for each of the 4 groups, in a modern animal feed manufacturing unit, with the addition in them of 0 %, 7, 5 %, 10 %, and 12, 5 % respectively of milled carob of Greek production. The 4 types of ration were correctly balanced in energy and nitrogen and generally balanced in terms of all nutritious substances, covering the needs of pigs in the 3 stages of their fattening (weaning, pre-fattening and final fattening). During the experimentation, that lasted 150 days, all the parameters of the efficiency of feed utilization for pigs that were mentioned above, were determined. ...|$|R
