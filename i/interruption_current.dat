40|$|Abstract—Capacitive current {{interruption}} with air-break disconnectors in a high-voltage {{network is}} an interactive event between circuit and arc {{with a variety}} of interruptions and re-ignitions. In order to investigate this transient phenomenon, a series of interruption tests was performed at KEMA High Power Laboratory. In this paper, a brief analysis of the interruption process is presented and is compared with experimental data from the test. Typical wave shapes of voltages across the capacitances, disconnector and current through the disconnector are given. Re-ignition voltage and energy input to the arc on re-ignition are also investigated. Comparison shows that the test data are in good agreement with simulation. It is concluded that besides higher <b>interruption</b> <b>current</b> and higher power supply level, a lower ratio between source side and load side capacitance leads to more severe interruption and longer arc duration. In the end, the actual status of IEC recommendations on testing, that has taken into account this arc-circuit interaction, will be discussed.

40|$|Capacitive current {{interruption}} with air-break disconnectors in a high-voltage {{network is}} an interactive event between the circuit and arc {{with a variety}} of interruptions and reignitions. In this contribution, first, a theoretical analysis related to this interaction is presented. The effect of capacitances at the source side (Cs) and load side (Cl) is investigated. Three distinct frequencies are identified as contributing to the voltage and current events in the circuit. Besides the power frequency quantities, a medium frequency transient arises related to the excursion of voltage across capacitances to the applied voltage, and a high-frequency transient arises due to charge redistribution between load- and source-side capacitance at reignition. Second, experimental results from an interruption measurement are studied in detail. Typical waveshapes of voltages across the capacitances, disconnector, and currents through the disconnector show that the transients during interrupted are in agreement with the theoretical analysis. Reignition voltage of the air gap and energy input to the arc on reignition are also studied. It is concluded that besides a higher <b>interruption</b> <b>current</b> and a higher power supply level, a lower Cs /Cl ratio leads to more severe interruption and longer arc duration.

30|$|Since a fault created wave attenuates when {{travelling}} {{through a}} boundary inductor [12], {{the side of}} the fault with respect to boundary inductor can be easily and reliably identified if the magnitudes of disturbance at two sides are compared. A number of advantages are apparent in this method when compared with aforementioned methods of fault direction identification. As the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) based fault detection methods [9, 11] applied for detection of transmission line and bus faults demands both line side voltage and bus side voltages, no additional sensors are necessary. Fault directions can be readily identified without using costly high bandwidth CTs that needed to measure fast current transients. Furthermore, the rate of dropping of voltages during DC side faults is much faster than the rate of rising of fault currents: this is because the rate of rising of current is approximately equals to the time integral of voltage variation. Therefore, a voltage based directional element can detect the direction of a fault promptly when a travelling wave reaches the terminal. Rapid discharge of filter and cable capacitance are dominant during the early phase rising fault current [20]. Since the maximum/steady state fault currents for short circuit faults are likely to be much higher than the circuit breaker capabilities [21], a fault must be detected and the DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) must be opened before the fault current rises above the breaker’s maximum <b>interruption</b> <b>current.</b> This aspect has not been tested in the fault detection schemes such as the one presented in [12]. The rate of change of voltage based HVDC grid protection scheme presented in [9] can face difficulties during high resistance faults.|$|E

40|$|This paper defines and classifies fault {{clearing}} strategies for HVDC grid protection, {{based on the}} method of fault <b>current</b> <b>interruption.</b> HVDC grid protection must act on a much shorter timescale than AC grid protection and faces the challenge to interrupt fast rising fault currents without natural zero crossings. Conversely, the HVDC grid protection equipment, such as HVDC breakers or converters with fault blocking capability, offers several degrees of freedom for {{fault clearing}} strategies for HVDC grid protection. However, each of these strategies fulfils different objectives and imposes different requirements on HVDC grid components. Therefore, a classification of fault clearing strategies is needed.
