40|$|Alumina foam was {{prepared}} by the direct foaming method. The foam was stabilized by in situ partially hydrophobized particles of Al 2 O 3. <b>Dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> was used for hydrophobization and it also acted as a foaming agent. The composition of the starting suspensions (Al 2 O 3, boehmite, <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> and water) were varied according to factorial design. The resulting properties observed were: foam ratio, foam shrinkage on drying and sintering, bulk density and porosity of ceramic foams, average pore size and compressive strength. The final properties of foams dependent on statistically significant factors (boehmite, <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid)</b> were evaluated by common software. The foam ratio decreased and the bulk density of the alumina foams increased with increasing quantity of the <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 1 - 0. 2 wt. %). Bulk density of alumina foams ranged from 88 to 155 kg/m 3 and average pore size reached 111 μm to 215 μm depending on the quantity of the <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> The microstructure of ceramic foams reached high porosities ranging from 96 to 98 %. The compressive strength of the alumina foams increased with increasing quantity of boehmite (1 - 3 wt. %) and it reached values of 333 kPa...|$|E
40|$|Electrochromic {{polyaniline}} membrances {{were prepared}} by cyclic votammetry in <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> and HNO 3 solutions,respectively. The as-prepared membranes were characterized with Raman and FE-SEM and their electrochromic {{responses in the}} ionic liquid (BminPF 6) were measured and comparatively analyzed via in-situ UV-visible spectrophotoscopy to illustrate the possible effect of morphologies of polyaniline membranes on their electrochromic properties. The {{results show that the}} polyaniline membranes electrodeposited in <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> solution have good electrochromic responses. With BmimPF 6 as electrolyte,the electrochromic device was prepared by using electrodeposited polyaniline membrane electrode and WO 3 one. The in-situ UV-visible spectrophotoscopic data show that the as-prepared electrochromic device exhibited stable electrochromic response under the working potentials between- 1. 5 V~ 2. 0 V. The coloration and bleaching times are 4 s and 5 s,respectively and the coloration efficiency is 176 cm 2 C - 1 (λ = 600 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|Polyaniline soluble {{in organic}} {{solvents}} was prepared by oxidative polymerisation of aniline in <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) media. The solubility parameter was calculated [1] {{and the most}} suitable solvent (tetrahydrofuran) was selected [2] for the solubility and the most compatible polymer chlorosulfonated polyethylene [PCSPE] was selected for blending. Blending of polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni. DBSA) with poly(chlorosulfonated polyethylene) was carried out via solution mixing. Morphological {{studies were carried out}} by optical microscopy and TEM, and thermal analysis was performed. All the techniques showed a good degree of compatibility between the two polymers. The electrical conductivities of blends with proportions of 1 to 50 wt...|$|E
40|$|Temperature, T, {{dependence}} of the electrical conductivity, σ, of own-made polyaniline pellets, highly doped either by HCl or by <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid,</b> is discussed. For the both dopants, a variable-range-hopping exponent 2 / 5 is found below T* ≈ 200 − 250 K. This result can be understood {{on the basis of}} a recent theory of Fogler, Teber and Shklovskii which takes into account Coulomb correlations in a three-dimensional system of chain-like conductors, predicting a power-law density of states for charge excitations around the Fermi energy. At T > T *, the σ(T) curves are steeper, implying a tendency towards nearest-neighbour hopping by a reduction of the average hopping length. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{biosensor}} uses a novel aqueous-based nanoparticulate polyaniline (PANI), synthesised using <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) and aniline as starting material. These polymer nanoparticles {{have been}} electrodeposited {{on to the}} surface of carbon electrodes resulting in conductive nano-films, which were examined by electrochemistry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), profilometry and spectroelectrochemistry. Biomolecules were then electrostatically adsorbed onto this surface and physical techniques have shown that the nanofilm possesses properties which allow for uniform adsorption of protein to take place. This effective biosensor format has been characterised using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H 2 O 2 format. This sensor exhibits higher signal/noise (S/N) ratios and quicker response times than previous PANI biosensor formats developed by our group, due to its nanofilm characteristic...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that complexation of <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid,</b> DBSA, to a diblock copolymer of polystyrene-block-poly(4 -vinylpyridine), PS-block-P 4 VP, leads to polymeric supramolecules PS-block-P 4 VP(DBSA) (y) (y = 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0), which self-organize with a particularly large lamellar periodicity {{in excess of}} 1000 Angstrom. The structures consist of alternating PS and P 4 VP(DBSA) (y) layers, where the latter contains smaller internal structure, probably lamellar. The DBSA side chains are bonded to the pyridines by protonation and hydrogen bonding and they effectively plasticize the material. In this way relatively well-developed structures are obtained even without annealing or macroscopic alignment. Transmission and reflectance measurements show that a relatively narrow and incomplete bandgap exists for supramolecules of high molecular weight block copolymer at ca. 460 nm...|$|E
40|$|This work investigates {{polyaniline}} (PANI) nanoparticles, (synthesised using <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) as a dopant), as a novel, highly processable, non-diffusional mediating {{species in}} an enzyme biosensing application. These nanoparticles are readily dispersed in aqueous media which helps overcome {{some of the}} processability issues traditionally associated with polyaniline. Modification of screen-printed electrodes was readily achieved these aqueous nanoparticle dispersions, where the nanoparticles were simply cast by a drop-coating method onto the surface. After suitable pH adjustment, it was shown that horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme could {{be added to the}} dispersion, and cast simultaneously with the conducting polyaniline. This effective fabrication method involves no electrochemical steps, and as such is easily amenable to mass production. The feasibility of casting enzyme with polyaniline nanoparticles is demonstrated in this short communication. More accurate deposition of protein-containing inks onto screen-printed carbon working electrodes could in the future transfer the drop-coating protocol from manual deposition to large-scale production by mechanical methods such as ink-jet printing...|$|E
40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} {{are being}} widely {{employed in the}} manufacture of nanostructured sensors due to breakthroughs in the development of sophisticated nano-sized forms. One of the most attractive conducting polymers is polyaniline (PANI) due to its interesting electrical, electrochemical and optical properties, such as air stability and simple acid/base doping/dedoping chemistry. However, the fact that aniline is a carcinogenic monomer, its insolubility in common solvents and the acidic conditions required to the most conductive form of PANI are made its commercial application very difficult so far. The synthesis of PANI nanoparticles using <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) as both dopant and surfactant have allowed the use of this polymer in aqueous media, improving its processability. The additional use of ammonium persulphate (APS) as an oxidant together with DBSA during chemical PANI polymerization have {{led to the creation of}} a spherical PANI nanoparticle aqueous dispersion. Such dispersion can be deposited onto the electrodes by means of traditional methods, such as drop coating, or using more sophisticated techniques, such as inkjet printing. The application of PANI nanoparticles inkjet printed onto carbon paste screen-printed electrodes for ascorbic acid sensing is shown in the present wor...|$|E
40|$|Many current {{clinical}} {{disorders such as}} hypertension, arteriosclerosis, {{coronary artery}} disease and cerebral thrombosis are associated with abnormal levels of cholesterol in blood. Therefore, {{the development of a}} reliable and simple method for cholesterol determination is essential in clinical diagnosis. Electrochemical biosensors {{have been shown to be}} a very important method of cholesterol estimation because they provide rapid responses without the need of sample dilution and they are suitable for mass production at low cost. Cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) is most commonly used as the biosensing element in the fabrication of cholesterol biosensors. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is released as the end-product of the enzymatic reaction and its concentration may be used as an indicator in the progress of the reaction. Recently, our group has reported a significant enhancement in the catalytic activity of silver screen printed electrodes (Ag SPEs) towards H 2 O 2 reduction after exposure to a mixed surfactant/salt solution. [1] The electrodes modified with a <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) and KCl solution exhibited up to 80 -fold higher responses when H 2 O 2 was measured by amperometry at - 0. 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In the present work, DBSA/KCl modified Ag SPEs were used as a platform for the development of a cholesterol biosensor by coupling its electrocatalytic ability towards H 2 O 2 reduction to the enzymatic oxidation of the cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase. The use of inkjet printing during the modification process might improve the variability of the sensing devices found in previous manual modification procedures by enhancing the control of the reagent volume and exposure times. [2] Also, it would allow the deposition of low volume of the biological reagents, leading to a reduction of the waste. Analytical parameters of the biosensors such as LOD, sensitivity and reproducibility were measured. The device was then assessed for the quantitative determination of cholesterol in serum. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} has, {{for many}} years, {{been shown to}} be a very important compound due to its wide and varied applications in many industrial processes as well as biological systems. Therefore, its detection and measurement represents an important analytical issue. Traditional methods such as titrimetry or spectrophotometry have more recently been displaced by electrochemical techniques, which have proven to be an inexpensive and effective means of hydrogen peroxide determination. Hydrogen peroxide is also the final product in many biochemical processes, most notably in oxidation reactions employing enzymes such as glucose oxidase where it is used extensively as a reporter molecule which is amenable to electrochemical detection. In this work, a novel electrocatalyst for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide was employed as the foundation for the development of an electrochemical biosensor for glucose determination. Critical to this development was {{to understand the nature of}} the novel catalytic material which was based on a modification of silver paste electrodes, and the fabrication of an enzyme biosensor platform capable of operating on this material. A further key theme that was explored in this work was to make the biosensor amenable to fabrication using printing techniques, including screen printing and inkjet printing. With regard to the novel electrocatalyst, it was shown that the modification of silver screen printed electrodes (Ag SPEs) with a solution of <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) and potassium chloride (KCl) significantly improved the catalytic activity of those electrodes towards the electrochemical reduction and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Characterisation of the modified electrodes was performed by surface analysis and electrochemical techniques. Other surfactant/salt combinations were also assessed and showed an analogous catalytic effect on the hydrogen peroxide reactions. The application of such a phenomenon for the development of novel hydrogen peroxide sensors was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Many enzymatic reactions, e. g. the {{oxidation}} of glucose or cholesterol by {{glucose oxidase}} (GOx) or cholesterol oxidase (ChOx), respectively, {{in the presence}} of oxygen release hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as an end-product. Therefore, the determination of its concentration may be used as an indicator in the progress of the reaction. Many metal and metal alloys such as Pt, Pd, Ag, Pd/Au and Au/Pt have been employed in recent years in the manufacture of electrochemical sensors for H 2 O 2 determination. However, its slow electrocatalytic kinetics at metallic electrodes and the need for high applied potentials have prevented it from being more widely used as the signalling molecule in biological systems. Recently, our group has reported a significant enhancement in the catalytic activity of silver screen printed electrodes towards H 2 O 2 reduction after exposure to a mixed surfactant/salt solution. [1] The electrodes modified with a <b>dodecylbenzenesulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DBSA) and KCl solution exhibited up to 80 -fold higher responses when H 2 O 2 was measured by amperometry at - 0. 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The use of inkjet printing during the modification process might improve the variability of the sensing devices found in previous manual modification procedures by enhancing the control of the reagent volume and exposure times. [2] In the present work, DBSA/KCl modified silver screen printed electrodes were assessed for their ability to couple this electrocatalysis to the reduction of H 2 O 2 generated from enzymatic reactions. First, a mediatorless glucose biosensor was fabricated by the immobilization of GOx onto the modified electrode. The deposition of a perm-selective membrane of cellulose acetate was required to prevent interferences at the electrode surface as well as to facilitate enzyme immobilization. Then, the capacity of the electrocatalyst to detect the H 2 O 2 produced after the enzymatic reaction of cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol was evaluated. Analytical parameters of the biosensors such as LOD, sensitivity and reproducibility were measured. The device was shown to be capable of the quantitative determination of both glucose and cholesterol. [1] L. Gonzalez-Macia, M. R. Smyth, A. Morrin, A. J.
