25|$|Implementation. In {{order to}} meet the {{objectives}} of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as <b>joint</b> <b>implementation,</b> the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{crediting}} period for <b>Joint</b> <b>Implementation</b> (JI) was {{aligned with the}} first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.20). In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N2O emissions.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2001 Local Government Ordinance, {{water supply}} and {{sanitation}} services in other cities and towns are expected to be transferred from provincial governments to the roughly 500 newly created Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs). Responsibilities for coordination and <b>joint</b> <b>implementation</b> across TMAs were devolved to the 120 District Governments. However, as indicated above, challenges in the transition period were reported and provincial Public Health and Engineering Departments (PHEDs) in the four Pakistani Provinces continue to provide water services, especially in rural areas. In urban areas outside the largest cities, local governments have formed public sector water boards.|$|E
