40|$|Background. Hemorrhagic vasculitis, or Schönlein-Henoch purpura (SHP), is {{the most}} common type of {{systemic}} vasculitis in childhood, and peculiarities of the further evolution of the pathological process in adult patients remain unexplored. Objective: to study the evolution of juvenile SHP, comparing the nature of lesions of the skin, joints, heart and kidneys in patients in childhood and adulthood. Material and methods. The study included 92 patients (61 men and 31 women with the average age of 27 years, and the average age of disease onset — 11 years). <b>I</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity of the pathological process is determined in 40 % of cases, II — in 35 %, III — in 25 %. Seropositivity by hyperimmunoglobulinemia A occurred in 27 % of cases, by the presence of rheumatoid factor — in 21 %. At the time of the survey, cutaneous syndrome was diagnosed in 55 % of patients, joint one — in 45 %, kidney one — in 71 %. Renal biopsy was performed in 15 cases. Results. The cutaneous, cutaneous-joint-abdominal and cutaneous-abdominal-renal forms of the disease, lesions of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, wrist, ankle and knee joints become rarer in the process of juvenile SHP evolution, but exceptionally renal variant of the pathological process, changes of skeletal muscles, liver, spleen and the heart are revealed more often, chronic kidney disease with the renal failure progression is developed in 12 % of patients (in 17 % of cases of nephropathy), sacroiliitis, spondylopathy, tendovaginitis, enthesopathies, epiphyseal osteoporosis and meniscitis of the knee joints are arisen, II, III, VI and IV morphological classes of Henoch glomerulonephritis are formed in a ratio of 8 : 4 : 2 : 1 with tubulointerstitial component in all cases, and lymphohistiocytic infiltration of the vascular wall is the unfavorable sign for the prognosis of the disease. Conclusions. In cases of transition of juvenile SHP into the chronic adult form, the disease often obtain progressive course that, first of all, refers to the pathology of the joints and kidneys...|$|E
40|$|Articular {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the main signs of the microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), which in some regions of the Earth accounts for over 90 % of all systemic vasculitis (SV), associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). It was found that 5 years after the manifestation of MPA, a progressive reduction of the para-articular (epiphyseal) bone mineral density and destruction of the joints begin to form. Many questions related to the nature of the course of joint pathology in specific ANCA-SV require further study. Objective: to evaluate joint damage in patients with MPA and the relationship with extra-articular pathology. Material and methods. We study involved 89 patients with MPA aged 18 – 78 years old, among which there were 44 % men and 56 % women. The duration of the disease from the first signs of manifestation was 7 years. Acute or subacute course of MPA has been registered in 27 % of cases, and in the rest — chronic one; <b>I</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity of pathological process has been detected in 10 % of cases, II —in 32 %, III — is 58 %. Results. The joint involvement is observed in 60  % of patients with MPA, in 40 % of cases it occurs in the form of oligoarthritis, depends on the presence of pathology in skeletal muscles, pneumopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Clinical, radiological and sonographic signs of articular pathology in MPA are closely associated with patients’ age, disease duration, lesions of the heart, kidneys and skin. In the pathogenetic structures of arthropathy in patients with MPA, C-reactive protein (CRP) and circulating immune complexes (CIC) are involved, and the nature of ANCA (antibodies to myeloperoxidase and proteinase- 3) is of small value, while the high blood levels of rheumatoid factor (RF) have certain prognosis-negative significance in terms of the severity of joint pathology. Conclusion. Unfavorable prognostic criteria for the development of joint pathology in patients with MPA are indicators in the blood: CRP > 20 mg/l and CIC > 130  с. u., and the RF values > 60 IU/ml are considered the risk factors for severe arthropathy...|$|E

To cope with <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> control channel saturation and <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> channel blocking by primary users, channel hopping (CH) schemes are commonly used in the literature for control channel establishment in CRNs. There are three metrics that are widely used for evaluating <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> CH schemes: (<b>i)</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overlapping (<b>the</b> number <b>of</b> distinct rendezvous channels), (ii) worst case time-to-rendezvous (TTR), and (iii) system load. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} symmetric and synchronous setting and propose a novel Cycle-Adjustable Channel Hopping (CACH) scheme that outperforms several existing CH schemes, including SSCH and QCH, in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three metrics. <b>The</b> key idea <b>of</b> CACH is to create an additional layer of logical channels on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> physical channels so that <b>the</b> cycle <b>of</b> channel hopping sequences can be adjusted to optimize system performance. The mathematic tools for our scheme are based on the operations in Galois fields that are more general than the prime number modular arithmetic used in SSCH. We show that CACH is much more general than SSCH and it can achieve <b>the</b> maximum <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overlapping while allowing the worst case TTR to be adjustable. It is also much better than QCH in terms of reducing system load while keeping <b>the</b> same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overlapping and <b>the</b> same worst case TTR. Our simulation results show that CACH outperforms several existing schemes in many other aspects, including throughput, and robustness to <b>the</b> disturbance <b>of</b> PUs.

In {{a previous study}} using numerical simulations, we found that this scaling {{can be explained by}} both the money-transport model, where a firm (i. e. customer) distributes money to its out-edges (suppliers) in proportion to <b>the</b> in-degree <b>of</b> destinations, and by the correlations among the Japanese inter-firm trading network. However, in this previous study, we could not specifically identify what types of structure properties (or correlations) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network determine the 1. 3 exponent. In the present study, we more clearly elucidate the relationship between this nonlinear scaling and the network structure by applying mean-field approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diffusion in a complex network to this money-transport model. Using theoretical analysis, we obtained <b>the</b> mean-field solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model and found that, in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese firms, <b>the</b> scaling exponent <b>of</b> 1. 3 can be determined from <b>the</b> power law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearest neighbours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network with an exponent of - 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{roughness}} <b>of</b> polymer surfaces {{is often}} investigated to guarantee both the surface integrity {{and the surface}} functionality. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major problems in roughness measurement analyses consists in determining both the evaluation length and the reference line (<b>i.</b> e., <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial equation) from which roughness parameters are computed. This article outlines an original generic method based on <b>the</b> generalized analysis <b>of</b> variance and experimental design methodology for estimating the most relevant roughness parameter p, the most pertinent scale, s, and finally, <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial fitting, d. This methodology is then applied to characterize <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> four process parameters on <b>the</b> final roughness <b>of</b> poly(polypropylene) samples obtained by injection molding. This method allows us to determine the most efficient triplet (p, s, d) that best discriminates <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> a process parameter q. It is shown that different (p, s, d) values are affected to each process parameter giving finally the scale on which each process parameter modifies <b>the</b> roughness <b>of</b> a polymeric surface obtained by injection molding.

40|$|Online auction {{platforms}} like eBay {{provide a}} wide range of auctions containing substitutable goods. Some of these auctions exhibit parallel elements which means that two or more auctions run side by side for a certain time. Experiments have shown that multiple auctions ending at the same time, result in significantly lower efficiency due to <b>the</b> coordination failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buyers. I introduce an experimental setup with three sellers and four buyers in an overlapping multiple second price auction environment, where every seller runs one auction with a homogeneous good and the buyers are confronted with single unit demand. Furthermore, <b>I</b> vary <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlap between the successive auctions. One main result is that sellers revenue is significantly higher in overlapping multiple auctions than in parallel multiple auctions. Moreover, I observe a lower coordination failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buyers in overlapping auctions than in parallel multiple auctions. Due to these results, efficiency in overlapping multiple auctions is higher compared to the efficiency in parallel multiple auctions. internet auctions, cross bidding, market design, electronic business...|$|R
40|$|We provide below, for completeness, an {{addition}} to the Theoretical Framework outlined in the main text and Appendix. We have broken this addition into parts. In Part I, we provide a more explicit discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom used to treat the host in complex with an ion. Part II provides a statistical rationale for <b>the</b> decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canonical probability density of an ion complexed in a host, which further elaborates on the correlation function written in Eq. 4. The small system grand canonical ensemble is described for <b>the</b> limiting cases <b>of</b> a “fluid ” and a gas in Part III. A more explicit discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical potential in the small system grand canonical treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex is given in Part IV. Finally, Part V provides definitions for various physical properties discussed in <b>the</b> main text. <b>I.</b> <b>Degrees</b> <b>of</b> Freedom in <b>the</b> Abstracted Ion-Host System To explain further <b>the</b> reduced <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom we utilize in the main text {r N,R}, let us write all <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ion, effectively placing the ion at the origin, E(x 0,S) = E (S "). In this work, we explicitly state the position, x 0, (e. g. whether {{it is in the}} bulk or at a particular site) when it is of consequence...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Excoriation (skin-picking) {{disorder}} (SPD) {{is often}} conceptualized as a behavioral addiction in which aberrant reward processing may {{play an important}} role. The current study sought to develop a self-report instrument – the Skin Picking Reward Scale (SPRS) – that measures how strongly skin picking is ‘liked’ (<b>i.</b> e., <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> pleasurable feelings while receiving the reward) and ‘wanted’ (<b>i.</b> e., <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motivation to seek the reward). Methods We administered the SPRS to individuals who endorsed excessive skin picking in online surveys and examined the scale’s factor structure (Studies 1 and 2). We then asked individuals with documented pathological skin picking to complete the SPRS and other relevant questionnaires on two occasions one week apart (Study 3). Results Exploratory (Study 1; n[*]=[*] 330) and confirmatory (Study 2; n[*]=[*] 144) factor analyses consistently supported a two-factor structure reflecting the ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’ constructs. Results from Study 3 (N[*]=[*] 36) indicated that the Wanting and the Liking scales had adequate internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Additionally, consistent with predictions, the Wanting scale, but not the Liking scale, was associated with picking urges the following week, greater cue-reactivity, and more picking-related routines/habits. Discussion These initial findings suggest that SPRS is a psychometrically sound measure of ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ in pathological skin picking. The SPRS may facilitate research on reward processing anomalies in SPD {{and serve as a}} useful clinical instrument (e. g., to identify those at risk for cue-induced relapse) ...|$|R
