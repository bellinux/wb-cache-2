500|$|Grigorieva {{had signed}} with Gibson's music label {{prior to the}} album's release. The music project {{was made by the}} film {{production}} company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. So, I guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> to that notion for the album title." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague... As I meditated on the {{fragility}} of our human frame, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> once more {{to the life of}} the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences. According to Rolling Stone and MTV, other artists attributed as influences are The Ronettes, Dionne Warwick, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tina Turner ...|$|E

2500|$|King Diogo's successor, {{whose name}} is lost to history, was killed by the Portuguese, and {{replaced}} with a bastard son, who was more pliant to Tomista interests, Afonso II. The common people of Kongo were enraged at his enthronement, and responded with riots throughout the kingdom. Many Portuguese were killed, and the royal port of Mpinda was closed to the Portuguese, effectively ending the slave trade between Kongo and Portugal. Less than a year into this chaos, King Afonso II was murdered while attending mass, by his brother, the next manikongo, Bernardo I. King Bernardo allowed the boycott of Portuguese trade to continue, while quietly reestablishing relations with Lisbon. King Bernardo I was killed warring against the Yaka, in 1567. The next manikongo, Henrique <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> into {{a war in the}} eastern part of the country, where he was killed, leaving the government in the hands of his stepson Álvaro Nimi a Lukeni lua Mvemba. He was crowned as Álvaro I, [...] "by common consent," [...] according to some witnesses.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no, not at all; I had {{rather an}} aversion at first," [...] she replied, with the instant superiority {{of a woman}} where the man suffers any topic to become personal. [...] "Why did you think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw that}} your Majesty was engaged {{with my sister}} queens," [...] she interrupted, in a rich, low voice, [...] "and with some other ladies in the gallery there, whose faces I seem to remember, but who I think were not queens.

6000|$|And {{behold the}} superstition {{affected}} even the licentious good-for- nothing Abbe. Down he dropped upon his knees, hiding his eyes, and sobbing out: 'Sancta Margarita, spare me, spare me! I vow thee a silver image.

6000|$|I {{begged her}} pardon for interfering, and replied that I {{would give up}} the idea of driving on that day. She made no further remark. I left the room, {{determining}} to watch her. There is no defense for my conduct; it was mean and unbecoming, no doubt. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> on, by some force in me which I could not even attempt to resist. Indeed, indeed I am not a mean person by nature! ...|$|E

6000|$|Alvarez smiled. [...] "There was a {{time when}} we had money in the {{treasury}} and I might have gone; {{but it was too late}} afterwards. Part of the revenue stopped in Galdar's hands--that was one way of embarrassing me--and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to use the rest to undermine his plots. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>drawing</b> on my small private estate." ...|$|R
60|$|Maud {{shook her}} head, {{and there was}} reproof in her eyes. But just then the wrist I held leaped from my hand, and the hand clasped like a steel trap about my wrist. I cried aloud in awful fear, a wild inarticulate cry; and I caught one glimpse of his face, {{malignant}} and triumphant, as his other hand compassed my body and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> down {{to him in a}} terrible grip.|$|E
6000|$|My uncle {{said that}} was what he had expected, and when at last Gordon-Nasmyth reappeared and {{mentioned}} in an incidental way that he had been to Paraguay on private (and we guessed passionate) affairs, the business of the [...] "quap" [...] expedition had to be begun again at the beginning. My uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical, but I wasn't so decided. I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by its picturesque aspects. But we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until Capern's discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{is blood}} red? I {{could no more}} help it, than I could live without breath.

The day and hour were none of my choice. Sleeping and waking, I had been among the old haunts for years--had visited my own grave. Why did I come back? Because this jail was gaping for me, and he stood beckoning at the door.' ...|$|E

60|$|Lor.

60|$|Alphonse stopped weeping, {{and began}} to rub his back. 'Monsieur,' he said, 'doubtless means to console, but his hand is heavy. To continue: we loved, and were happy in each other's love. The birds in their little nest could not be happier than Alphonse and his Annette. Then came the blow -- sapristi! -- when I think of it. Messieurs will forgive me if I wipe away a tear. Mine was an evil number; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> for the conscription. Fortune would be avenged on me for having won the heart of Annette.|$|E
60|$|My gaze then seemed impelled {{and held}} by things afar, a vast yellow and purple {{corrugated}} world of distance, apparently {{now on a}} level with my eyes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by the beauty and grandeur of that scene; and then I was transfixed, almost by fear, by the realization that I dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness. I kept looking afar, sweeping the three-quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next.|$|E
60|$|So far I {{admit that}} I was wrong, but now I {{come to the}} sequel. Supper over, the colonel and some other {{officers}} left the room, for {{it was in a}} farm-house that the mess was held. There remained a dozen or so, and a goat-skin of Spanish wine having been brought in we all made merry. Presently this Major Olivier asked me some questions concerning the army of Germany and as to the part which I had myself played in the campaign. Flushed with the wine, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> on from story to story. It was not unnatural, my friends.|$|E

5000|$|Still in {{the midst}} of his {{undergraduate}} work, Haney interned with architect Richard McCommons. During that year he designed and helped construct a private residence over the summer.

I have no doubt I shall discover my original form {{in the same way}} that I find the trees in which the wild bees hive. When I first catch sight of a bee-tree <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>drawn</b> towards it, <b>I</b> know not how. Something says to me: 'That is what you are looking for.' In the same way I believe that I shall find my original form. When I see it, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> towards it. Something will say to me: 'That is it.'" ...|$|R
