500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> her through the door. Sitting {{on top of the}} piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nor can I, now," [...] Ralph said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse,</b> just now, and I {{will almost}} swear to its being the sea--though {{how we could}} get there, I don't know." ...|$|R
60|$|He linked {{his arm in}} {{mine and}} drew me away. As we turned {{the corner of the}} drive <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> over my {{shoulder}} of the Little Nugget's parents. They were standing where we had left them, as if Sam's eloquence had rooted them to the spot.|$|R
60|$|The {{people stood}} silent, and on every upturned face of which <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>I</b> saw {{something}} that was akin to pity. Presently, however, as we drew nearer to the Palace, a murmur began to rise. It swelled and grew fierce. Suddenly a cry rose vehement and clear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Mrs. Doncastle's new maid--if {{that was}} she <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the other day--is ever so {{much older than}} you--a dozen years.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed to}} an oaken cupboard, {{and as he}} threw it open <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> glistening rows of {{parallel}} barrels, like the pipes of an organ.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{could see}} nothing, but {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> {{a bit of}} smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple and yellow of the vegetation.|$|E
60|$|The tent flap {{lifted and}} the mob pressed in. Stretching {{out in a}} queue like <b>a</b> serpent, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> in the pale saffron {{moonlight}} of the crowd beyond. The sixpences danced in the tray. Once more the flap descended; my audience stilled. I looked {{from one to the}} other, smiling, defiant.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{believe there}} is some wild animal up yonder tree, {{spotting}} us," [...] answered Tom. [...] "I think <b>I</b> just <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of its eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found nothing}} worth {{notice in the}} church, {{and was about to}} leave it again, when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> a pretty view through a side door, and stopped to admire it.|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> our poor companion's face. He seemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as if dazed, and no sound came from his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Were you not at {{the opera}} on Tuesday?" [...] began he, {{assuming}} at once the airs of a man of fashion. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> you in the Duchess of Diddlebury's box." ...|$|E
60|$|There were {{fragments}} of tracery, of mouldings and cornices, and grotesque bits of architecture there, which I {{would have given}} a good deal to be the possessor of. Stepping into a little cottage hard by {{to speak to the}} guide about unlocking the gates, when we went out on our moonlight excursion at midnight, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse,</b> in <b>an</b> inner apartment, of a splendid, large, black dog. I gave one exclamation and jump, and was into the room after him.|$|R
60|$|Madame Blumenthal seemed, for the time, to have abjured the Kursaal, and <b>I</b> never <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of her. Her young friend, apparently, was an {{interesting}} study, and the studious mind prefers seclusion.|$|R
60|$|I had now a good {{opportunity}} of examining his person. He was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> both of <b>a</b> diamond and of a dagger. These observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> {{your coat}} through the window, and I felt sure that I knew your coat. Have you seen Katharine or William? I'm {{wandering}} about Lincoln {{looking for the}} ruins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God! Captain Poke," [...] I exclaimed, {{the instant}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the {{formidable}} danger that menaced us, [...] "you surely {{do not mean}} to continue madly on, with such a warning of the consequences in plain view?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was a clang of the bell, {{followed}} instantly {{by heavy}} steps upon the stair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade {{appeared in the}} doorway. Over his shoulder <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> one or two uniformed policemen outside.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Ogden as Mr Abney {{showed him}} into his study. He seemed a self-possessed boy, very like but, if anything, uglier than the {{portrait}} of him which I had seen at the Hotel Guelph.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I shall {{probably}} never see that child again, yet what a pleasant picture she leaves in my memory!" [...] I thought to myself, as <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse</b> {{of the brown}} hat going round the corner.|$|R
60|$|Our {{proceedings}} {{of that first}} morning did little to advance the investigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. While {{we made our way}} along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it drove by us <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his face, {{flushed and}} forced against the bookcase, {{from between the}} swaying limbs of my captors and his. To my astonishment his eyes were really {{brilliant}} with pleasure, {{like those of a}} child heated by a favourite game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Word of honor, Paul!" [...] he declared; [...] "I {{never saw}} the old rat take a thing! I simply landed him with the brooch. It was not until he was going out that <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> those other things in his pocket." ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. The {{carriage}} drew to {{the side}} of the road. We rushed by, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> three faces. My spirits rose. There was only the Baron to deal with. Madame Richard and Isobel were the other occupants of the carriage.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed the}} barracks of the Chasseurs of the Guards, {{and the line}} of cafes all filled with uniforms. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> as <b>I</b> went by of the blue and gold of some of my comrades, amid the swarm of dark {{infantry}} coats and the light green of the Guides. There they sat, sipping their wine and smoking their cigars, little dreaming what their comrade had on hand. One of them, the chief of my squadron, caught sight of me in the lamplight, and came shouting after me into the street. I hurried on, however, pretending not to hear him, so he, with a curse at my deafness, went back at last to his wine bottle.|$|R
60|$|We got out; {{and leaving}} {{him to hold}} the pony, went into a long low parlour looking towards the street, {{from the window of}} which <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse,</b> as <b>I</b> went in, of Uriah Heep {{breathing}} into the pony's nostrils, and immediately covering them with his hand, as if he were putting some spell upon him. Opposite to the tall old chimney-piece were two portraits: one of a gentleman with grey hair (though not by any means an old man) and black eyebrows, who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape; the other, of a lady, with a very placid and sweet expression of face, who was looking at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost require {{introducing}} to you, for <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> but <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of you as}} {{we crossed}} the river, and you look so different {{now that you have}} got rid of that hideous attire that I don't think that I should have known you." ...|$|R
60|$|The brushes parted. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> a {{long brown}} {{body and a}} hairy head. Then the {{creature}} reared up, breasting itself against a log, full in front of me. Great heavens! It was not a bear at all. It was a man.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Issus leaning far forward {{upon her}} throne, her hideous countenance {{distorted}} in a horrid grimace of hate and rage, in which I thought I could distinguish {{an expression of}} fear. It was that face that inspired me to the thing that followed.|$|E
60|$|I held my candle high, and {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the man's head {{staring at}} me over a barrel. He had a gold chevron on his black cap, and the expression of his face told me in an instant {{that he was an}} officer and a man of refinement.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is an advantage," [...] Captain Nelson laughed. [...] "When I {{think that}} you have raised your hand against that venerable but {{somewhat}} truculent prelate, I shudder at your boldness. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of him as he passed, but I could see that he looks rather scared." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{man with}} the shade became aware of my {{presence}} for the first time, and threw his head {{back for a moment}} and sideways, to see me. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> momentary <b>glimpse</b> of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he began to cough and splutter again.|$|R
5000|$|One car {{stood by}} the little platform, ready to start. ... This was a third class car. A first class stood in a siding. ... Another car of which <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> at Selsey completes, I believe, the [...] "passenger rolling stock" [...] of the little railway. ... The Company own two engines, the [...] "Selsey" [...] and the [...] "Chichester", the former for [...] "passenger" [...] and the latter, a [...] "six-wheels coupled" [...] for [...] "goods" [...] traffic. The [...] "Selsey", a trim-looking little side-tank locomotive, is painted dark blue with a red lining ... The boiler is surmounted with a {{handsome}} brass dome on which are two spring balances the safety valves, while a neat copper ring is an adornment to the chimney.|$|R
