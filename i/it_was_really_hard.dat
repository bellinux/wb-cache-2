Two episodes featuring Tyzack had already been broadcast, and she featured in a further one on 14April.

EastEnders executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, added: [...] "In order to continue the current storyline we've taken the decision for Heather Chasen to take over the role of Lydia." [...] The character died on-screen and Chasen made her last appearance on 13June2011, and, though not credited for it, did a voice-over for the 14and 28 June episodes. Kirkwood later said [...] "Lydia's storyline was perfect" [...] and that Chasen had made the part her own after Tyzack's departure.

Trummer said it felt [...] "really good" [...] to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, [...] "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even {{at the end of the}} race I thought he would struggle more but he didn’t. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> to attack him. That was a great race. I had a great pace and I’m happy with P2." [...] Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an [...] "unbelievable" [...] start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season.
