5|$|Aravan {{is known}} as Kuttantavar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> sect which bears his name, and {{in which he is}} the chief deity. His main temple is in Koovagam, Tamil Nadu.

The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the village}} of Bani Jamra, al-Jamri became a Hussaini khatib (Shia preacher) after {{finishing}} primary school.

He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was elected to the newly formed parliament. The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir, Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, after it had rejected the State Security Law. In 1977, al-Jamri was appointed as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain. He held the position until 1988, when he was briefly arrested due to his criticism of the government.|$|E

5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E

In the 14th and 15th centuries, several Imperial edicts, initially issued by Emperor Charles IV, put the abbacy under the protection of the counts of Luxembourg.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per this bill, trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete {{power over the}} administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some sections of the assembly which {{felt that this was}} an intrusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern over some of its provisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} a week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's {{chaplain}} took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> life {{of those who}} could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E

5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> and political conditions of the present world.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No.454) polemically {{mention the}} devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities {{and may be}} a garbled and {{confused}} version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion of}} historians {{is that the}} temple was built as a {{dedication}} to the Shaivite beliefs of Hinduism (from {{the large number of}} Shaivaite images seen on the lintels of the main temple and in other adjoining temples). But at some stage during the Middle Ages, there was a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs of the rulers and people adopted Vaishnavite beliefs of Hinduism as witnessed by the images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita deified in the main sanctum sanctorum of the temple complex.|$|E

The Scoutmaster must be at least twenty-one and is directly responsible for training and guiding the boy leaders, working with other adults to bring Scouting to boys, and for using the methods of Scouting to achieve the aims of Scouting.
