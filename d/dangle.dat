These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} simple {{algorithm}} for computing the PageRank (stationary distribution) of the stochastic Google matrix G. The algorithm lumps all <b>dangling</b> nodes {{into a single}} node. We express lumping as a similarity transformation of G, and show that the PageRank of the nondangling nodes can be computed separately {{from that of the}} <b>dangling</b> nodes. The algorithm applies the power method only to the smaller lumped matrix, but the convergence rate is {{the same as that of}} the power method applied to the full matrix G. The efficiency of the algorithm increases as the number of <b>dangling</b> nodes increases. We also extend the expression for PageRank and the algorithm to more general Google matrices that have several different <b>dangling</b> node vectors, when it is required to distinguish among different classes of <b>dangling</b> nodes. We also analyze the effect of the <b>dangling</b> node vector on the PageRank, and show that the PageRank of the <b>dangling</b> nodes depends strongly on that of the nondangling nodes but not vice versa.

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{computer}} simulations {{of the light}} induced degradation of amorphous silicon solar cells. It is now well established that when amorphous silicon is illuminated the density of <b>dangling</b> bond states increases. <b>Dangling</b> bond states produce amphoteric electronic mid-gap states which act as efficient charge trapping and recombination centres. The increase in <b>dangling</b> bond states causes {{a decrease in the}} performance of amorphous silicon solar cells. To show this effect, a modelling approach has been developed which uses the density of localised states with exponentially increasing band-tails and <b>dangling</b> bond defect states distribution chosen according to the defect pool model. The calculation of the evolution of <b>dangling</b> bond state density during illumination has been achieved through a dynamic scaling relation derived from a defect creation model. The approach considers the amphoteric nature of the <b>dangling</b> bond state and thus accounts for the contributions of the different charge states of the <b>dangling</b> bond during the degradation process. This paper attempts to describe the simulation approach which calculates the defect density as a function of energy, position in the solar cell and illumination time. In excellent agreement with other workers, our simulation results show that the increase in the density of neutral <b>dangling</b> bond states during illumination is higher than of the charged states...|$|R

25|$|Flowers are {{produced}} early in spring, with or slightly {{ahead of the}} first pitchers. They are held singly on long stems, generally well above the pitcher traps to avoid the trapping of potential pollinators. The flowers, which depending on species are 3–10 centimeters in diameter, are dramatic and have an elaborate design which prevents self-pollination. It consists of five sepals superintended by three bracts, numerous anthers, and an umbrella-like five-pointed style, over which five long yellow or red petals <b>dangle.</b> The whole flower is held upside-down, so that the umbrella-like style catches the pollen dropped by the anthers. The stigmas are located at {{the tips of the}} umbrella-like style. The primary pollinators are bees. Bees searching for nectar must force their way past one of the stigmas to enter the chamber formed by the style. Inside, they will inevitably come in contact with a lot of pollen, both from the hanging anthers and from the pollen collected by the style. Upon exiting, the bees must force their way under one of the flap-like petals. This keeps them away from the stigma, avoiding self-pollination. The next flower visited receives on its stigmata some of the first flower's pollen, and the cycle continues.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{geometry}} of the <b>dangling</b> base in 105 published structures (from X-ray/NMR) containing single-stranded overhangs has been analyzed and correlated to the thermodynamic stabilization found (UV) for the corresponding <b>dangling</b> base/closing basepair combination in short oligonucleotides. The study considers most combinations of closing basepairs, sequence and <b>dangling</b> base residue type, attached in both the 3 ′- and 5 ′-ends of both DNA and RNA. Linear regression analysis showed a straightforward correlation (R) 0. 873) between the degree of screening for the hydrogen bonds of the closing basepair provided by the <b>dangling</b> base and the resulting thermodynamic stabilization in both DNA and RNA series with <b>dangling</b> ends either at the 3 ′- or at the 5 ′-terminus. Regression analysis of only the datasets from RNA gives an improved correlation, R) 0. 934, showing that <b>dangling</b> ends on RNA are more ordered than the <b>dangling</b> ends on DNA, R) 0. 376. This study highlights the gain in the free energy of stabilization owing to the favorable stacking between the <b>dangling</b> nucleobase and the neighboring basepair and the resulting strengthening of the hydrogen bond of the closing basepair. By acting as a hydrophobic cap on the terminal of the DNA or RNA duplex, the dangling-end residue restricts the bulk water access to the terminal basepair, thereby providing it with a microenvironment devoid of water, which consequently enhances its thermodynamic stability, making it energetically comparable to the corresponding interna...|$|R

25|$|In 1821, Greek nationalists in the Romanian Principalities {{and in the}} Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, {{launched}} a series of uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, aiming to liberate ethnic Greeks from three centuries of Ottoman rule (see Greek War of Independence). The Ottoman government responded with a determined effort to defeat the rebellion. For the Ottoman government, Greece was a core province. Its loss could not be contemplated, unlike other regions such as the Romanian Principalities and Serbia, which were considered peripheral vassal-states. The fear of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II (ruled 1808–39), was that the secession of even {{a small part of}} Greece such as the Peloponnese would lead to demands by Greek nationalists for the liberation of all the other regions of the empire containing Greek majorities, including central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, Constantinople itself, western Anatolia, the Aegean islands and Crete, threatening the empire's very existence. In addition, the Greeks were economically critical, as they dominated the empire's trade through their ownership of much of its merchant shipping. On a personal level, Mahmud considered the Greek revolt a monstrous betrayal by a conquered nation that had always been treated generously by the Porte. The Sultan vented his fury on the ethnarch and spiritual leader of the Greeks, the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, whom he suspected of colluding with the rebels. As the Patriarch emerged from his cathedral, in full regalia, after celebrating Easter Mass in April 1821, he was seized by Janissaries and hanged on the spot, from the cathedral gates.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the charging state of an isolated single <b>dangling</b> bond formed on an unpassivated Si(100) surface with c(4 ? 2) reconstruction, by comparing {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and spectroscopy analysis with density functional theory calculations. The <b>dangling</b> bond is created by placing a single hydrogen atom on the bare surface {{with the tip of}} a scanning tunneling microscope. The H atom passivates one of the dimer <b>dangling</b> bonds responsible for the surface one-dimensional electronic structure. This leaves a second <b>dangling</b> at the reacted surface dimer which breaks the surface periodicity. We consider two possible H adsorption configurations for both the neutral and the doped situation (n- and p-type). In the case of n-doping we find that the single <b>dangling</b> bond state is doubly occupied and the most stable configuration is that with H bonded to the bottom Si atom of the surface dimer. In the case of p-doping the <b>dangling</b> bond is instead empty and the configuration with the H attached to the top atom of the dimer is the most stable. Importantly the two configurations have different scattering properties and phase shift fingerprints.
