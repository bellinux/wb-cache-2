5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final <b>EPROM</b> chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E

25|$|The company {{continued}} to spend greatly {{on research and}} development, {{and in addition to}} other breakthrough products, created the world's first 512K <b>EPROM</b> in 1984. That year AMD was listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America, and based on 1984 income it made the Fortune 500 list {{for the first time in}} 1985.|$|E

25|$|Flash memory {{combines}} {{a number of}} older technologies, with lower cost, lower power consumption and small size made possible by advances in microprocessor technology. The memory storage was based on earlier <b>EPROM</b> and EEPROM technologies. These had limited capacity, were slow for both reading and writing, required complex high-voltage drive circuitry, and could be re-written only after erasing the entire contents of the chip.|$|E
25|$|While the {{earliest}} microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing {{most or all}} of the internal electronic parts of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an Intel 8742, is an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of <b>EPROM,</b> and I/O in the same chip.|$|E
25|$|When NOR flash was developed, it was envisioned {{as a more}} {{economical}} and conveniently rewritable ROM than contemporary <b>EPROM</b> and EEPROM memories. Thus random-access reading circuitry was necessary. However, {{it was expected that}} NORflash ROM would be read much more often than written, so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block-wise fashion. On the other hand, applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word-level write address, which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily.|$|E

25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via read-only memory (ROM, <b>EPROM,</b> etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E
500|$|The saucer in the {{original}} game design {{was supposed to take}} a shot as soon as it appeared. This action was altered so there would be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to [...] "lurking" [...] from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could [...] "hide" [...] {{at the opposite end of}} the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an <b>EPROM</b> restricting such chances. Usage of the names of Saturday Night Live characters [...] "Mr. Bill" [...] and [...] "Sluggo" [...] to refer to the saucers in an Esquire article about the game led to Logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a lawyer with the [...] "Mr. Bill Trademark." ...|$|E
2500|$|BASIC, other {{languages}} and utility ROM chips resided {{in any of}} four 16KB paged ROM sockets, with OS support for sixteen sockets via expansion hardware. The five (total) sockets were located partially obscured under the keyboard, with the leftmost socket hard-wired for the OS. [...] While the original usage for the perforated panel on {{the left of the}} keyboard was for a Serial ROM or Speech ROM, a ZIF socket or edgecard connector could be installed in that location instead. [...] The socket could be connected to one of the empty Sideways/PagedROM sockets via a header cable. The paged ROM system was essentially modular. [...] A language-independent system of star commands, prefixed with an asterisk, provided the ability to select a language (for example *BASIC, *PASCAL), a filing system (*TAPE, *DISC), change settings (*FX, *OPT) or carry out ROM-supplied tasks (*COPY, *BACKUP) from the command line. The MOS recognised a handful of built-in commands, and polled the paged ROMs in descending order for service otherwise; if none of them claimed the command then the OS returned a Bad command error. Connecting an external <b>EPROM</b> programmer, one could write extensive programs, copy to programmable ROM (PROM) or <b>EPROM,</b> then invoke them without taxing user memory.|$|E
50|$|The Bytesaver, {{introduced}} by Cromemco in 1976, {{was the first}} programmable memory board for the MITS Altair and S-100 bus microcomputer systems. The Bytesaver had sockets for 8 UV-erasable <b>EPROMs</b> providing up to 8 Kbytes of storage. The <b>EPROMs</b> could be programmed by the Bytesaver, or read as computer memory. In the history of microcomputer systems, the Bytesaver was the first viable alternative {{to the use of}} punched paper tape for storing programs, and has been called “a great advance in microcomputer technology”.|$|R

2500|$|Kildall and {{his wife}} Dorothy {{established}} a company, originally called [...] "Intergalactic Digital Research" [...] (later renamed as Digital Research, Inc), to market CP/M through advertisements in hobbyist magazines. Digital Research licensed CP/M for the IMSAI 8080, a popular clone of the Altair 8800. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a de facto standard and had to support {{an increasing number of}} hardware variations. In response, Kildall pioneered the concept of a BIOS, a set of simple programs stored in the computer hardware (ROM or <b>EPROM</b> chip) that enabled CP/M to run on different systems without modification.|$|E
2500|$|AMD {{had some}} success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 [...] "World Chip" [...] FSK modem, {{one of the first}} multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex. Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the {{perceived}} shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am29000 (29k) processor; the 29k survived as an embedded processor. The company also increased its <b>EPROM</b> memory market share in the late 1980s. Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, germicidal lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some <b>EPROM</b> erasers. Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning germicidal), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E
5000|$|Also, PROMs (programmable ROMs), <b>EPROMs</b> (ultraviolet-{{erasable}} PROMs) and EEPROMs (electrically erasable PROMs) {{are available}} {{that can be}} programmed using a standard PROM programmer without requiring specialised hardware or software. However, there are several disadvantages: ...|$|R
50|$|The control store {{consisted}} of 4K x 4 bit 40ns SRAM chips. This {{meant that the}} control store was writable. It was loaded at power up and Master Clear from two 32Kx8 bit <b>EPROMs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M70 was {{developed}} between 1982 and 1984. It was a quad Q-bus module {{based on the}} J-11 chipset incorporating on-board ECC DRAM, bootstrap <b>EPROMs</b> and 4 serial lines implemented using DEC DC319 DLART chips.|$|R
2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in <b>EPROM).</b> Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hardware}} {{was similar}} to its predecessor {{in the fact that}} it used 2 main circuit boards. In this case it used a [...] "CPU board" [...] and a [...] "Video Board". The <b>EPROMs</b> were split between both boards.|$|R
25|$|In March 1996, three {{different}} separately-sold 8M memory paks were produced already containing prerecorded data of this sort. These special 8M paks bore all new decals and contained <b>EPROMs</b> {{that could not}} be overwritten by new download data from the Satellaview.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{microcontrollers}} {{relied on}} erasable {{programmable read-only memory}} (<b>EPROM)</b> devices to hold the application program. The object code from a host system would be [...] "burned" [...] onto an <b>EPROM</b> with an <b>EPROM</b> programmer. [...] This <b>EPROM</b> was then physically plugged into the board. As the <b>EPROM</b> would be removed and replaced many times during program development, it was common to provide a ZIF socket to avoid wear or damage. Erasing an <b>EPROM</b> with a UV eraser takes a considerable time, {{and so it was}} also common for a developer to have several EPROMs in circulation at any one time.|$|E
5000|$|Erasable {{programmable}} {{read-only memory}} (<b>EPROM)</b> can be erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light (typically for 10 minutes or longer), then rewritten with a process that again needs higher than usual voltage applied. Repeated exposure to UV light will eventually wear out an <b>EPROM,</b> but the endurance of most <b>EPROM</b> chips exceeds 1000 cycles of erasing and reprogramming. <b>EPROM</b> chip packages can often be identified by the prominent quartz [...] "window" [...] which allows UV light to enter. After programming, the window is typically covered with a label to prevent accidental erasure. Some <b>EPROM</b> chips are factory-erased before they are packaged, and include no window; these are effectively PROM.|$|E
