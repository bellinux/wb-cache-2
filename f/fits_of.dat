5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|The infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, {{won with}} {{tremendous}} effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein's private <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the First Piano Concerto, {{did not help}} matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele Aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsdörfer, Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev.|$|E

Capital utilization improves the <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> the model by increasing the volatility of output, investment, and hours worked, while habit formation improves the <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> the model by improving the dynamic properties of consumption and the current account.

Limitations of existing theories have hindered {{the development of}} operationalized models for measuring the strategic <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> a firm’s information system. Using configurational theory {{and the concept of}} emergent strategies and capabilities, this paper develops a model for measuring the strategic <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> a specific type of information system: supply chain management information systems (SCM IS). Findings from a multiple-case study of five manufacturers indicate the developed model can give an accurate, reliable, and useful analysis <b>of</b> the strategic <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> a firm’s SCM IS. The operationalized model is sufficiently grounded theoretically and empirically to enable further study <b>of</b> the strategic <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> IS and its relationship with firm performance...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> laughter.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E

25|$|The Bible's tone {{with regard}} to Saul changes {{over the course of}} the narrative, {{especially}} around the passage where David appears, midway through 1 Samuel. Before, Saul is presented in positive terms, but afterward his mode of ecstatic prophecy is suddenly described as <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> madness, his errors and disobedience to Samuel's instructions are stressed and he becomes a paranoiac. This may indicate that the David story is inserted from a source loyal to the House of David; David's lament over Saul in 2 Samuel 1 then serves an apologetic purpose, clearing David of the blame for Saul's death.|$|E

Evagrius Scholasticus reports that Sophia managed to conclude a three-year truce with Khosrau on her own.

As his health began to give way, he began to age prematurely and fell into <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> despondency.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of inflation inertia on business cycle frequency inflation and output dynamics. We reassess the empirical <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> a DSGE model incorporating the purely forward looking New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) and compare it with the empirical <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> a DSGE model incorporating the hybrid Phillips curve. Empirical fit is evaluated by comparing dynamic properties of theoretical impulse responses with those of empirical impulse responses estimated for the US economy. We confirm that the purely forward looking NKPC implies too little inflation and output persistence. While the inflation inertia assumption significantly improves the <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> inflation persistence, it cannot improve the <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> observed output persistence. In addition, the NKPC implies too closely synchronized inflation and output dynamics. This feature can only be improved by the hybrid Phillips curve when relatively {{a high degree of}} inflation inertia is assumed...|$|R
