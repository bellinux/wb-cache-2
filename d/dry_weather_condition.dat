40|$|Abstract — The ancient city, Mandalay {{has many}} {{historical}} relics such as pagodas and monasteries {{and other religious}} buildings. Mandalay city and most of heritage relics are founded by King Mindon in 1857. But, Maha Myat Muni Pagoda is founded by King Bodawphaya in October 1784, {{which is the most}} famous Buddhist statue in Myanmar. Mandalay city is suffered from urban fire all the time mostly in spring and summer. Urban fire is threatening the whole citizens and other natural resources. And due to hot and <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition,</b> the fire outbreak can happen easily and the fire can spread easily to the environment. So, the historical relics are needed to preserve from these hazards. Urban fire safety plays a prominent role for this city. For the cultural heritage and historical religious buildings, conservation and prevention from fire case are major consideration. The paper presents about fire risk assessment for historical heritage buildings and detail study and analysis on Maha Myat Muni pagoda complex. The research work includes the analysis with six types of criteria from the aspects of fire safety. All the required considerations have been proposed by upgrading the compound and that will be of great support not only for heritage conservation but also for urban fire safety.

40|$|A {{rooftop unit}} (RTU) is {{typically}} {{referred to as}} a unitary system, which employs direct-expansion (DX) air-condensing equipment for cooling and then provides the conditioned air to the space through dedicated air distribution system. Over the years, the DX RTU has wide applications due to its greater flexibility, lower installation cost, and more useful space. System challenges may include reliability, noise, vibration, and humidity control; however, most of these issues have been resolved by technology advancements. One challenge, the compressor 2 ̆ 2 short-cycling, 2 ̆ 2 has not been successfully solved with satisfactory partial load performance and minimum initial cost. This excessive on/off cycling drastically reduces the compressor reliability and increases space humidity. ^ The problem is attributed to the system load modulation not matching the building load variation. Although significant progress has been made to resolve short-cycling, current methods cannot provide a satisfactory solution. Dr. Mingsheng Liu (2004) developed and patented (US 60 / 701, 608) an advanced control algorithm to resolve the DX RTU 2 ̆ 7 s short cycling. This algorithm is based on the fundamental vapor compression theory that different evaporating temperatures will produce varied refrigeration effects. Elimination of the system cycling may be achieved by optimizing supply air temperature reset to match building load condition. ^ This research develops and justifies this advanced control algorithm. A mathematic model has been built to simulate the system performance loads for different weather conditions. Results show short-cycling to be completely eliminated under various operating conditions with no extra energy cost under higher load or humid weather condition and significant savings under the lower load or <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition.</b> In addition, field investigation has been conducted in a functioning office building, which further proves the effectiveness of this advanced control algorithm. ...|$|E

Cultivation of winter rapeseed cultivars in semi arid regions of Iran however it has high potential for production, but, mentioned cultivars are late maturity and this late maturity cause to that silique formation and seed filling periods mature {{in the same time}} with hot and <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition.</b> In contrast, spring rapeseed cultivars are shorter growth duration and in this regard, identification of spring rapeseed cultivars with high cold tolerance for autumn planting cause to early harvest. In order to investigation of spring rapeseed cultivars reaction to spring and autumn planting dates, an experimental was carried out in a split plot design based on RCBD with four replications for two years (2004 - 2006) in Karaj. Treatments were included planting season in two levels as main plots such as common planting date, autumn planting (27 September) and spring planting (25 March) and spring rapeseed varieties as sub plots in 24 levels. The results indicated that simple effects of planting season and variety and also interaction effect on silique per plant, seed per silique, 1000 seed weight, seed yield, oil yield, biologic yield and harvest index were significant at 1 % level probability. In autumn planting, Hyola 401 with greatest 1000 seed weight and high seed per silique had the highest seed yield (4689 kg. ha- 1) and Hyola 330 produced the maximum oil yield (2165 kg. ha- 1), wherease RG 405 / 03 had the maximum seed yield and oil yield (2066 and 713. 6 kg. ha- 1, respectively) in spring planting.

40|$|Cotton {{leafhopper}} Amrasca devastans (Distant) a sucking pest {{of cotton}} {{of the family}} Cicadellidae and Cotton scale or mealy bug Phenacoccus sp. of the family Pseudococcidae infest {{a wide range of}} crops including Solanum melangena and Habiscus esculentus. All the stages of both the species are injurious to crops and the infestation may be very prominent and characterized by leaf curl, stunted growth and white scales, which cover the nodes, twigs and bolls. They exhibit three types of damage in all i. e. 1 st direct damage by sucking the plant sap, secondly both pests are capable of transmitting viral and other infectious disease pathogens in the fields, thirdly the secretion of honey dew by Phenacoccus sp. which assists in fungal growth in the fields. Presently horizontal and vertical life budgets and survivorship curves of A. devastans and Phenacoccus sp. is drawn monthly starting from May 05 to August 06 in lab and compared with that of field data following Southwood (1978). The life table is used to determine the most vulnerable stage and key limiting factors, affecting the mortality both in laboratory and in the field. The survivorship curves constructed both from laboratory and field data were found to be apparently resembling with the type III and IV of Slobodkin (1962) with some deviations. The most vulnerable stage in the life table of A. devastans was found to be the initial 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd instars and for Phenacoccus sp. it was 1 st and 2 nd and to some extent the 3 rd instars, Study of population dynamics recorded high density of all the stages of both the pests during May 05 through Aug 05 and Apr 06 to Jul 06 whereas low density of all the stages for both the species were found during Nov 05 through February 06. The main limiting factors affecting the mortality in laboratory were found to be very low temperature and <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> associated with fungal infestation, which were also true for the field data along with the very high temperature and heavy rain fall and poor food supply. Correlation of population density with minimum mean temperature and mean percent humidity showed that both the factors in certain limits have strong positive and significant correlation with all the stages of cotton leafhopper while very weak, positive and non significant correlation was found with these factors and different stages of Phenacoccus sp.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{concerned}} with an experimental study of parabolic trough collector’s with its sun tracking system designed and manufactured. To facilitate rapid diffusion and widespread use of solar energy, the systems should also be easy to install, operate and maintain. In order to improve the performance of solar concentrator, different geometries and different types of reflectors were evaluated {{with respect to their}} optical and energy conversion efficiency. To assure good performance and long technical lifetime of a concentrating system, the solar reflectance of the reflectors must be high and long term stable. Therefore, different types of reflector materials and absorbing materials were analyzed in this work; also the optical properties and degradation of the reflecting surfaces were assessed. During the research, focus has shifted from evaluation of the performance of concentrating solar collector to analysis of the optical properties of reflector and absorbing materials. The shift of focus was motivated by the need to assess long term system performance and possibilities of optimizing the optical efficiency or reducing costs by using new types of reflector materials and absorbing materials. For the design of the SPTC frame, a finite element model had been developed and used to check the capability of the structure to absorb torsion and bending forces, under dead and wind loads. The SPTC was fabricated in local workshops and the sun tracking system was assembled using electric and electronic components in the market, while the mechanical components making up the driving system were procured from the second hand market. The fabricated SPTC and its tracking system were tested outdoors in the campus under dry and wet weather. The experimental results obtained have shown that the obtained characteristic curve of the tested Aluminium collector is considerably lower than that of a mirror collector which {{can be attributed to the}} higher thermal losses for the lack of the evacuated glass envelope around the absorbing tube, the end losses of the collector and the inaccuracy in tracking the sun. However, the mirror collector efficiency is about 8 % higher than that of Aluminium under <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition,</b> which is fairly acceptable, considering that it was the first attempt to manufacture such mirror collector locally.

40|$|Sri Lanka is {{an island}} at the Indian Ocean with 65234 km 2 {{and it has a}} power demand of 2000 MW. The hydro power was the main power source before year 2000, after maximum usage of hydro power Sri Lanka {{installed}} fossil fuel power plant to achieve the demand. Then the electricity price gradually increased due to higher increment of fuel price. As the solution for this higher price of electricity the government has to go to new profitable power source the coal power. Finally year 2011 Puttalam coal power plant 300 MW x 1 was installed with the hope of providing the low cost reliable energy supply to Sri Lanka and it will be extended to 300 MW x 3 plan in year 2015. Therefore the puttalam coal power plant is the key power plant to the Sri Lankan power generation and it is expected to have the maximum output (base load) to the Power demand of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a tropical country and it has two different weather seasons as rainy season and dry season. The puttalam power plant situated at Kalpitiya peninsula and it has normally <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> <b>condition,</b> Months of April, October November and December have heavy rain condition (Meteorological Department, Sri Lanka, 2012). The puttalam coal power plant may not achieve full load because of high moisture content at rainy season. So this Thesis carried out to find the capability to achieve the full load with available plant, plant capacity by using different coal qualities. Then find the economical benefits and effect on the environment with the recommended coal for different seasons and also design a storage plan to coal storage at existing coal yard. Based on the historical data and the Meteorological department rain fall data and by doing a technical analysis the recommended coal type was selected and the capability of plant equipment capacity to the recommended coal to achieve the full load was analyzed. Then the coal storage plan was designed according to annual requirement of the different recommended coal and economical benefit was analyzed by considering last year cost for generated power and the generation cost, if recommended coal is used for last year. Finally flue gas analysis was carried out for the recommended coal to find the effect on the environment. The recommended coal for rainy season is with the heating value of 6600 kcal/kg and for dry season it is 6300 kcal/kg. The capacities of main boiler and other plant equipments are capable for the recommended coal to achieve the full load of the plant. Then the design of the coal storage plan was given under figure 4. 2 and table 4. 1. It was calculated that a profit of 3. 932 million US$ can be achieved by using the recommended  coal for the last year and also when compared with the changing price of oil and coal it will be more profitable for the future. Because the oil price increases very rapidly and the increase in coal price is very low compared to the oil price. Finally the SOx and NOx emissions from recommended coal were analyzed and it was within the environmental limits because of the high quality emission reduction plant equipments...|$|E
