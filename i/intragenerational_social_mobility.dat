In addition, although several theories suggest that transitions between classes in the social hierarchy can be stressful experiences, few studies have empirically examined whether such movements may have health effects, over and above the implications of "being" in these classes. In an attempt to investigate whether <b>intragenerational</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> is associated with functional somatic symptoms in mid-adulthood, the current study tests three partially contrasting theories. METHOD: The dissociative theory suggests that mobility in general and upward mobility in particular may be linked to psychological distress, while the falling from grace theory indicates that downward mobility is especially stressful. In contrast, the acculturation theory holds that the health implications of social mobility is not due to the movement itself but attributed to the class contexts in which people find themselves. Diagonal Reference Models were used on a sample of 924 individuals who in 1981 graduated from 9 (th) grade in the municipality of Luleå, Sweden. Social mobility was operationalized as change in occupational class between age 30 and 42 (measured in 1995 and 2007). The health outcome was functional somatic symptoms at age 42, defined as a clustering self-reported physical symptoms, palpitation and sleeping difficulties during the last 12  months. RESULTS: Overall mobility was not associated with higher levels of functional somatic symptoms compared to being immobile (p[*]=[*] 0. 653). After controlling for prior and current class, sex, parental social position, general health, civil status, education and unemployment, the association between downward mobility was borderline significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 055) while upward mobility was associated with lower levels of functional somatic symptoms (p[*]=[*] 0. 03). CONCLUSION: The current study did not find unanimous support for any of the theories. Nevertheless, it sheds light on the possibility that upward mobility may be beneficial to reduce stress-related health problems in mid-life over and above the exposure to prior and current class, while downward mobility can be of less importance for middle-age health complaints...|$|E

40|$|Compared {{to their}} White peers, ethnic {{minorities}} in England are often {{at higher risk}} of becoming unemployed, unable to find employment, {{and more likely to}} experience downward, rather than upward social mobility. Qualifications, gender, age, marital status and migrant generation all play a role; but do not explain these ethnic inequalities, or ethnic penalties. Despite ethnic minorities being more likely to live in deprived neighbourhoods than Whites, research on ethnic inequalities in social mobility has rarely taken account of the role of context. Neighbourhood deprivation may reduce life-chances for various reasons, and the concentration of ethnic minorities into deprived neighbourhoods may have additional influences for social mobility: some positive, but also some negative. In this thesis, I ask: does neighbourhood deprivation and ethnic composition explain the ethnic inequalities in social mobility? Using a longitudinal analysis of the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study, I tracked the <b>intragenerational</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of people living in urban areas of England between 1991 and 2001. Binary and multinomial logit regression models were fit with ethnicity as an independent variable to explore statistical differences between groups, and also for the White, Indian and Black Caribbean groups separately. My research shows that after controlling for education, couple status, {{and a number of other}} important characteristics, geography does play a role in life-chances; but does not fully explain the ethnic inequalities in social mobility. People in more deprived neighbourhoods tended to fare worse in all economic outcomes: more at risk of unemployment; less likely to find employment; more at risk of downward social class mobility; less likely to experience upward social class mobility. However, these results were statistically significant only among White people, with less consistent associations for ethnic minorities. Ethnic diversity had a positive influence upon outcomes (e. g. upward social class mobility), but only among White people. Positive outcomes were also more common among people living in the south of England. Place of birth was less important for social mobility. For policymakers attempting to reduce the geographical inequalities of deprivation and affluence, dissolving residential concentrations of minorities alone is unlikely to reduce the gap in life chances between Whites and ethnic minorities. No evidence was found to support the pejorative stereotyping of so-called ‘ethnically segregated’ neighbourhoods, which are some of the most diverse in England and, on balance, appear to improve the life chances of White people...|$|E
40|$|Background: There are {{at least}} three broad {{conceptual}} models for the impact of the social environment on adult disease: the critical period, <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> and cumulative life course models. Several studies have shown an association between each of these models and mortality. However, few studies have investigated the importance of the different models within the same setting and none has been performed in samples of the whole population. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to study the relation between socioeconomic position (SEP) and mortality using different conceptual models in the whole population of Scania. Methods: In the present investigation we use socioeconomic information on all men (N = 48, 909) and women (N = 47, 688) born between 1945 and 1950, alive on January, 1 (st), 1990, and living in the Region of Scania, in Sweden. Focusing on three specific life periods (i. e., ages 10 - 15, 30 - 35 and 40 - 45), we examined the association between SEP and the 12 -year risk of premature cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. Results: There was a strong relation between SEP and mortality among those inside the workforce, irrespective of the conceptual model used. There was a clear upward trend in the mortality hazard rate ratios (HRR) with accumulated exposure to manual SEP in both men (p for trend < 0. 001 for both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality) and women (p for trend = 0. 01 for cardiovascular mortality) and (p for trend = 0. 003 for all-cause mortality). Inter- and <b>intragenerational</b> downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> was associated with an increased mortality risk. When applying similar conceptual models based on workforce participation, it was shown that mortality was affected by the accumulated exposure to being outside the workforce. Conclusion: There was a strong relation between SEP and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, irrespective of the conceptual model used. The critical period, <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> and cumulative life course models, showed the same fit to the data. That is, one model could not be pointed out as "the best" model and even in this large unselected sample it was not possible to adjudicate which theories best describe the links between life course SEP and mortality risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective cohort {{study was to determine}} the contribution of changes in social class within and between generations to mortality risk and to socioeconomic differentials in mortality. In 27 workplaces in the west of Scotland. 5567 men aged 35 - 64 Â years when screened, provided information on their father's occupation, their own first occupation and their occupation at screening. Mortality risk, from broad causes of death by intergenerational and <b>intragenerational</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> groups, was measured after 21 Â years. For all or some of the 3 routes of mobility (childhood to screening, labour market entry to screening and childhood to labour market entry), increasing values were seen across the 4 groups (stable non manual, upwardly mobile, downwardly mobile and stable manual) for diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, current smoking, early school leaving, angina, bronchitis, severe chest pain, and proportion living in deprived areas. Decreasing values were seen for serum cholesterol, height, FEV 1, exercise, never and ex-smokers, wine drinkers and car users. For mobility between childhood and screening and between childhood and labour market entry, mortality risk was highest for the stable manual group and lowest for the stable non manual group for all cause, cardiovascular disease and other causes of death. The upwardly and downwardly mobile groups had intermediate risks. For cancer mortality, the stable manual group had the highest risk with the other groups having lower and similar risks. For mobility between labour market entry and screening, the highest risk was for the downwardly mobile group for all cause and cardiovascular mortality. For cancer mortality, the risk was higher for men in manual social classes at all occasions. Adjustment for risk factors attenuated but could not completely explain the differentials in mortality risk. Overall, major differences in mortality risk were seen between the stable non manual and the stable manual groups, to which social mobility does not contribute. With the exception of the small intragenerationally downwardly mobile group there was little evidence that social mobility itself was associated with mortality outcomes different from those expected on the basis of lifetime socioeconomic experience. This is consistent with the suggestion that the main influence of socioeconomic position on mortality risk is an accumulative one, acting across the lifecourse. lifecourse mortality social class social mobility Scotland health inequalities...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} {{detailed discussion of}} educational pathways through Luxembourg’s stratified school system, addressing educational inequalities in a longitudinal perspective. The link between stratification and educational inequality is well documented (Van de Werfhorst & Mijs, 2010; Pfeffer 2008). However, stratified systems themselves differ in permeability and in the given opportunity structure for <b>intragenerational</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> through changes of school track. This dissertation focuses on the occurrence of permeability in the stratified educational system of Luxembourg by analysing secondary school students’ pathways. The study attempts {{to answer the following}} main research questions: How can the students’ pathways through Luxembourg’s educational system be characterised and systemised? Does the use of track changes rather increase or decrease educational inequalities? The author deals with these questions by carrying out a triangulated design combining secondary data analysis (administrative panel dataset of all 5, 301 students born in 1990 and PISA data) and narrative interviews with (former) school students. The conceptual framework is based on Boudon’s structural-individualistic approach (1974), Bourdieu’s capital theory (1983) and concepts of the sociology of youth (e. g. Zinnecker 2003). The cluster analysis reveals different types of complete pathways of secondary school students in Luxembourg. The largest group (37 %) of the students follows an immobile academic pathway, and some students in the academic track leave this track early (7 %). Within the technical track, which is further subdivided, more students follow a downwardly mobile pathway (21 %) than an immobile pathway (17 %). A small part of students within the technical track (12 %) belongs to upwardly mobile types (only 2 % of all the students make the transition from the technical to the academic track). The remaining 6 % of the students follow careers that were interrupted at least once. Thus, 46 % of all the students experience (multiple) broken secondary school pathways. The 15 qualitative interviews illustrate that the types of educational pathways are not directly linked to particular kinds of biographies in adolescent lives: Both, moratorium-oriented and transition-oriented students can be found in different pathway types. However, different trajectories afford different degrees of agency with respect to shaping the teenage years and creating professional identities. With regard to educational inequalities, results of logistic regression analyses reveal that socioeconomic and gender-specific placement gaps tend to increase during secondary schooling. On the other hand, migrant-specific disparities decrease through upwardly mobile pathways and higher continuity rates of students with migration backgrounds, whereby in case of vulnerable migrant groups this decreasing effect does not concern the transition to the highest tracks that are required for direct university entry. Further analyses show that the mechanisms behind different transition patterns vary between branching points and student groups in terms of achievement-related and decision-related effects. Thus, this study attempts to add to the body of knowledge of the permeability of educational systems and provides useful information to support the work of policy makers and consultants in the field of education...|$|E

Data from the West of Scotland Collaborative study allow an examination of the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> and both <b>social</b> and physical factors. Height, education and material circumstances in the family of origin, indexed as the number of siblings, were each independently associated with the chances of both upward and downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in this dataset.

This decline in educational inequality further translated into a reduction in the inequality in labour market chances between people from different social class backgrounds, thus increasing intergenerational <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Our findings suggest that educational policy can lead to substantial increases in intergenerational <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> which may have been overlooked in past research on societal-level, long- run trends in <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that social, educational, cultural and physical factors in childhood and early adulthood may influence the chances and direction of <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> the movement of an individual between social classes over his/her life-course. This study examined the association of such factors with intra-generational and inter-generational <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> within the Newcastle Thousand Families 1947 birth cohort. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the potential association of sex, housing conditions at age 5 years, childhood IQ, achieved education level, adult height and adverse events in early childhood with upward and downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Results: Childhood IQ and achieved education level were significantly and independently associated with upward mobility between the ages of 5 and 49 - 51 years. Only education was significantly associated (positively) with upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> between 5 and 25 years, and only childhood IQ (again positively) with upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> between 25 and 49 - 51 years.

40|$|We {{investigate}} redistributive taxation in {{a political}} economy experiment and determine how different patterns of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> affect the choices of redistributional taxes. In the absence of <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> voters choose tax rates that are very well {{in line with the}} prediction derived in the standard framework by Meltzer and Richard (1981). However, past or future changes in the income hierarchy affect the choice of the tax rate in the current period. The same is true for <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> within the period to which the tax rate choice applies and for the case where the choice of the tax rate takes place behind the veil of ignorance. Due to our design of the experiment, these strong effects of own <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> cannot be attributed to social or other-regarding preferences.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>mobility</b> and how {{it should}} be {{measured}} is an important topic for sociologists and historians. However, there have been very few studies on the link between <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> and the introduction of a state education system into England. Previous studies have measured <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> using occupational data from the census and then have related occupations to social status {{due to the nature of}} occupations being relevant to social status, as well as a person???s economic situation. This study contributes to existing research by conducting a localised case study, to drill deep into the records and thus offer more specific evidence than generalised surveys. The research involves using a main sample group of two hundred scholars taken from four schools in the registration district of Hitchin, all of whom underwent education soon after the 1870 Education Act. Examining the occupation of their head of household as a scholar and then the occupation they themselves went on to experience is used as a comparison to measure <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> A comparative group of another two hundred children from the same area who were of schooling age in 1851 are examined and their <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> measured in the same way, using their head of household???s occupation in 1851 and their adult occupation in 1871, to emphasise the difference in <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> between the two groups and show the difference between the two time periods. Using an occupational hierarchy system from an 1895 census return as a measurement of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> demonstrates upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of the sample group, demonstrating a link between <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> and the introduction of state education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that social, educational, cultural and physical factors in childhood and early adulthood may influence the chances and direction of <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> the movement of an individual between social classes over his/her life-course. This study examined the association of such factors with intra-generational and inter-generational <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> within the Newcastle Thousand Families 1947 birth cohort. Methods Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the potential association of sex, housing conditions at age 5 years, childhood IQ, achieved education level, adult height and adverse events in early childhood with upward and downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Results Childhood IQ and achieved education level were significantly and independently associated with upward mobility between the ages of 5 and 49 - 51 years. Only education was significantly associated (positively) with upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> between 5 and 25 years, and only childhood IQ (again positively) with upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> between 25 and 49 - 51 years. Childhood IQ was significantly negatively associated with downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Adult height, childhood housing conditions, adverse events in childhood and sex were not significant determinants of upward or downward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in this cohort. Conclusions As upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> has been associated with better health as well as more general benefits to society, supportive measures to improve childhood circumstances that could result in increased IQ and educational attainment may have long-term population health and wellbeing benefits. </p...|$|R
40|$|In our article, we {{consider}} problem of <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> The main {{purpose is to}} propose new channels of <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> which appeared in modern society. P. A. Sorokin made the development of problems movement of individuals within {{the system of the}} public. He proposes the channels of <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> At the end, we conclude that {{in view of the fact}} that society is a dynamic system and is in constant change, we must identify a number of new channels of social circulation, the appearance of which became possible only in the framework of modern society and due to the characteristics of its development. The conclusions of this article we can use for teaching courses related to social Sciences. Purpose:  find out new channels of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of individuality in modern society. Methodology:  analysis of scientific literature dedicated to researching the problem of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of individuality. Results:  the goal is reached, identified new channels of <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of the individuality in modern society.
