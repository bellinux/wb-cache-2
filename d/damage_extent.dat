Food prices rose dramatically, in some instances up to 400%, after both storms damaged crops. The storms also delayed shipments of sugar from neighboring countries, although prices were expected to fall once they arrived.

The actual effect of DHs calls for quantitative study. This paper presents a comparative study on the side structure resistance to collisions. A DH Aframax tanker and an SH Aframax tanker of similar size were selected for the study. The two vessels were assumed to be struck by a same bulbous bow in different locations and angles. The bow was assumed to be rigid and different non-linear materials and contact models were considered for the struck tankers based on the original designs. The DH tanker was found to be superior to the SH tanker in relation to resistance to side structural damage. Finally, by using the simulation results, the distribution of <b>damage</b> <b>extents</b> for DH tankers is proposed based on the historical <b>damage</b> <b>extents,</b> which are mainly for SH tankers...|$|R

40|$|Damage is {{inevitable}} in the reinforced concrete (RC) structures under various mechanical loads, {{which has a}} significant effect on the chloride diffusion. To predict the service life of RC structures in marine environment, it is essential to clarify the impact of <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> on the chloride transport in concrete. For this objective, uniaxial compression tests were conducted on the concrete specimens to create various extents of damage. The ultrasound velocity and the residual strain was measured to characterize the evolution of damage. Afterward, a non-steady state migration method was employed to evaluate the diffusivity of sound and damaged concretes. On the basis of damage mechanics, the damage variables were quantified by the increase of residual strain and the degradation of ultrasound velocity. A linear relationship can be used to correlate the residual strain based damage with the ultrasound velocity based damage. The chloride diffusivity relates well with the <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> in concrete.

30|$|Considering {{the issue}} of {{misjudgment}} in railway bridge damage identification, a method combining the step-by-step damage detection method with the statistical pattern recognition is proposed to detect the structural damage of a railway continuous girder bridge. The whole process of damage identification {{is divided into three}} identification sub-steps, namely, damage early warning, damage location, and <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> identification. The multi-class pattern classification algorithm of C-support vector machine and the regression algorithm of ε-support vector machine are engaged to identify the damage location and <b>damage</b> <b>extent,</b> respectively. For verifying the proposed method, both of the proposed method and the optimization method are used to deal with the measured data obtained from a specific railway continuous girder model bridge. The results show that the proposed method can not only identify the damage location correctly, but also obtain the <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> which is consistent with the experimental results accurately. By uncoupling finite element analysis and damage identification, normalizing the index, and seeking the separation hyper plane with maximum margin, the proposed method has more favorable advantages in generalization and anti-noise. As a result, it has the ability to identify the damage location and extent, and {{can be applied to the}} damage identification in real bridge structures.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the application potentials implied in the equivalent stiffness changes of complex mechanical structures as a measure of damage caused by low-velocity impacts. In a series of drop-weight tests of a commercial composite component, the impact force time variation is measured, and by calculating the respective displacement of the impacted structure, the stiffness of the structure in impacted points before and after the impacts is calculated. The determined stiffness change serves as the basis for defining a measure of <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> that is compared to the <b>damage</b> <b>extent</b> measures based on characteristic values of the measured force.
