40|$|The {{application}} of IFRS {{has caused a}} broad variety of examinations in literature. Numerous research studies in this context refer to accounting quality, comparability of financial reports and whether fair-value accounting is superior to historical-cost principles or not. All these issues have in common that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves,</b> as the difference between historical book values and their fair value counterpart, {{play an important role}} in these fields. Nevertheless, there is currently no detailed examination showing empirical data about <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> Using information from 456 Purchase Price Allocations, we are the first to show which balance sheet items mainly comprise <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> and to what extent. Our results show that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> exist in all balance sheet items, even in positions which are not supposed to contain reserves. We also find fewer <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> than we expected in provisions but higher portions in inventories, for example. Moreover, we provide details of which factors seem to influence the extent of <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> We contribute to the existing literature by adding empirical evidence to the theoretical discussions of faithfulness and comparability of financial statements...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparability}} of IFRS {{financial statements}} is frequently discussed {{in literature and}} numerous researches show that entities from different countries or with particular characteristics tend to use IFRS differently. However, <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves,</b> i. e. {{the discrepancy between the}} historical book values and their fair value counterparts, are usually not part of these investigations. Since we assume that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> can be a reliable measure of comparability, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine if specific factors of a company like size, country of origin or industry membership also indicate different odds to observe <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> Analysing 456 purchase price allocations, we do indeed find evidence for our aforementioned assumption. Our results show that the probability to observe <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> under IFRS seems to be dependent on certain factors. For instance, our results clearly indicate that large companies show <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> more frequently than small companies. We also find that entities from particular countries exhibit significantly higher odds to hold <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> than others. In consequence, we assume that the comparability of financial statements under IFRS is still not achieved...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{alternative}} {{explanation for why}} auc-tioneers often keep the reserve price hidden or secret. We consider a standard independent private values {{environment in which the}} buy-ers are risk-averse and the seller has private information about her valuation of the object to be auctioned. The seller uses a Þrst-price sealed-bid auction mechanism combined with either an announced re-serve price or a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price. We compare the sellers ex ante expected proÞts under these two policies and Þnd that the optimal <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price policy generates higher expected proÞts for the seller when the buyers are fairly risk-averse under particular restric-tions on buyers preferences and the distributions of private values. As the number of the buyers increases, the <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price is more likely to dominate. Numerical methods are used to demonstrate the generality of our main results.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} seller strategy on winning prices in online auctions. In our conceptual model, three strategic choices made by the seller - minimum opening price, auction length, and use of a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price - are mediated {{by the number of}} bids placed during the auction and moderated by product type. Our tests analyze eBay auction data for four consumer products through two matched studies (two products per study). In particular, we compare products for which value is easily determined with those for which value is less clear. Overall, we find strong evidence of the effects of minimum opening price and <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> prices on final winning prices. The impact of auction length on winning price is less clear. In general, our tests support the idea that potential buyers rely more on signals such as opening price and reserve price for products for which reference prices are less available.

A solution to this problem might involve a higher degree of integration of female engineers into the workforce. Data from the microcensus 2006, the official representative statistics of the population and the labour market in Germany, confirm the existence of a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> of female engineers. Ordered response models and seminonparametric estimation methods are used to show that the labour supply in the engineering sector is mainly determined by age. In addition, the labour supply of female engineers depends on how many children they have, on the age of their youngest child, and on their partners' income. Moreover, women care more about their families, rather than focusing on their career. Demographischer Wandel; Discrete Choice-Modelle; Fachkräftemangel; Frauenerwerbstätigkeit...|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{providers}} possessing {{large quantities}} of spare capacity must either incentivize clients to purchase it or suffer losses. Amazon is the first cloud provider to address this challenge, by allowing clients to bid on spare capacity and by granting resources to bidders while their bids exceed a periodically changing spot price. Amazon publicizes the spot price but does not disclose how it is determined. By analyzing the spot price histories of Amazon’s EC 2 cloud, we reverse engineer how prices are set and construct a model that generates prices consistent with existing price traces. Our findings suggest that usually prices are not market-driven, as sometimes previously assumed. Rather, {{they are likely to}} be generated most of the time at random from within a tight price range via a dynamic <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price mechanism.

40|$|Do {{economic}} recessions {{change the}} labor market attachment of women with children? How is the reentry process after childbirth dependent on the welfare state regime that mothers have to negotiate? We use data from the NLSY and the German Life History Study to test the effects of parental leave and unemployment rates for changes in mothers’ rate of return to employment {{after the birth of}} a child. We introduce and test two types of hypotheses of mothers’ employment continuity after birth, the "new hidden reserve" hypothesis and the "agency" hypothesis. In western Germany it is mothers on parental leave who appear to constitute a modern, institutionally fostered "new <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve.</b> " These mothers tend to return to their jobs later when unemployment is high. In the U. S., occupational prestige is a significant factor in supplying "agency" to mothers during economically tied situations.

40|$|The oceanic abyss (depths {{greater than}} 3000  m), {{one of the}} largest environments on the planet, is {{characterized}} by absence of solar light, high pressures and remoteness from surface food supply necessitating special molecular, physiological, behavioural and ecological adaptations of organisms that live there. Sampling by trawl, baited hooks and cameras we show that the Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) are absent from, or very rare in this region. Analysis of a global data set shows a trend of rapid disappearance of chondrichthyan species with depth when compared with bony fishes. Sharks, apparently well adapted to life at high pressures are conspicuous on slopes down to 2000  m including scavenging at food falls such as dead whales. We propose that they are excluded from the abyss by high-energy demand, including an oil-rich liver for buoyancy, which cannot be sustained in extreme oligotrophic conditions. Sharks are apparently confined to ca 30 % of the total ocean and distribution of many species is fragmented around sea mounts, ocean ridges and ocean margins. All populations are therefore within reach of human fisheries, and there is no <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> of chondrichthyan biomass or biodiversity in the deep sea.

40|$|Robust frames require {{relatively}} weak beams, but strong connections and columns. Limit state design {{may provide the}} reverse. The composite beams used {{in the majority of}} steel framed buildings are shown to possess a ?<b>hidden?</b> <b>reserve</b> of strength. When subjected to the large sagging deformations associated with terrorist attacks, these beams are capable of resisting typically twice their design load. This creates a situation whereby the weak point in a frame can be transferred to the connections, leading to non-ductile and potentially catastrophic failures in the event of severe overloading. Furthermore, certain industry standard nominally pinned connections are shown to lack the ductility required to accommodate large beam end rotations. This lack of ductility could result in the premature failure of connections due to the high tensile forces generated in the connection bolts. To address these problems an alternative approach is advocated, whereby ductile beams are designed to resist only working loads, albeit elastically. Thereafter the upper-bound flexural strength is established. It is the corresponding upper-bound reactions that are used for the subsequent design of components lower down in the load path. This approach would improve robustness and provide economies in the use of construction materials in structures considered at risk from terrorist attack...|$|E

After a description of the material, equipment and methods used for the tests, the outcomes of the investigation are presented and discussed. Finally, in the concluding chapter the implications of the results are critically discussed and a suggestion on how to assume the overstrength factor is presented.
