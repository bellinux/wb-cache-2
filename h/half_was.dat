5|$|By 1670, {{the city}} had 6,000tons of shipping, of which <b>half</b> <b>was</b> used for {{importing}} tobacco. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, this shipping was also playing {{a significant role in}} the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{an alley}} {{connecting}} Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore {{is the church}} of Santa Maria delle Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving <b>half</b> <b>was</b> kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each <b>half</b> <b>was</b> 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks spent much time on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed much longer than their opposition.|$|E

5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 48,360, the first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> goalless. Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the second half when Alan Kennedy scored. They held this lead to win the match 1–0, {{securing}} Liverpool's third European Cup and a fifth consecutive victory by an English team. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the competition three times.|$|E

5|$|Coming {{off their}} first {{loss of the}} season, the Triangles played against the Detroit Heralds. Bacon contributed to every point in the first quarter; he first a 3-yard rushing touchdown, and {{followed}} up by a catching a receiving touchdown. Dick Abrell contributed in the second quarter, as he scored a rushing touchdown. Sacksteder caught a receiving touchdown from Roudebush to put the Triangles up 28–0 at halftime. The second <b>half</b> <b>was</b> scoreless, and the Triangles moved on to a 5–1–2 record with one game left in their season.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, {{more than a year}} and a <b>half</b> <b>was</b> invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{received}} a bye {{to the third}} round of the tournament, and then progressed through five rounds before reaching the final. Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting to emulate the success of their rivals Sheffield Wednesday in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by Ted Drake in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in autogyros to see the match and the BBC experimented with sports commentators for the first time during its live broadcast of the final.|$|E
5|$|Gaozong {{awarded the}} {{military}} {{service of the}} Turkic commanders Mishe and Buzhen by appointing them as proxy rulers of ten Western Turkic tribes. The ten tribes were split between the two cousins, and the western <b>half</b> <b>was</b> given to Buzhen while Mishe controlled the eastern tribes. In 685, the sons of Mishe and Buzhen were sent from the Tang capital of Chang'an, where they resided, to succeed their fathers in the west. Neither lasted long as Turkic rulers; one was overthrown by his tribal subjects {{and the other was}} deposed by the Second Turkic Khaganate after an invasion in 690.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the <b>half</b> <b>was</b> slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E

5|$|In the 2011 {{edition of}} the Third Saturday in October, Alabama entered the game as a 30-point {{favorite}} over the rival Tennessee Volunteers. At Bryant–Denny, the Volunteers were looking for the upset after tying the game 6–6 at halftime; however 31 unanswered points resulted in a 37–6 Crimson Tide victory to extend their overall record to 8–0. The first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> dominated by both defenses with each only allowing a pair of field goals. Mike Palardy connected from 40 and 52-yards for Tennessee and Jeremy Shelley connected from 26 and 29-yards for Alabama.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} game of the season, Michigan hosted their archrivals the No. 9 nationally ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, in the 106th meeting between the two teams. Ohio State scored first when Michigan QB Forcier fumbled while {{scrambling}} in the end zone; the ball was recovered by Ohio State's Cameron Heyward for a TD. Michigan's only score of the first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> a 46-yard field goal. Ohio State's Brandon Saine ran in a 29-yard TD late {{in the second quarter}} to make it 14–3 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's {{economy is}} {{relatively}} well diversified. Trade and finance combined {{account for nearly}} one-third of GDP; transportation and communication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and mining and manufacturing constitute nearly another fifth. Despite plans to expand the private sector, the state remains the dominant force in Jordan's economy. Net official development assistance to Jordan in 2009 totalled USD 761 million; according to the government, approximately two-thirds of this was allocated as grants, of which <b>half</b> <b>was</b> direct budget support.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the first}} <b>half</b> <b>was</b> {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second was no different with both Alabama and LSU only managing a pair of field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each offense to less than 300 yards of total offense with each having a pair of interceptions. With the loss, Alabama dropped to 4–8 all-time in overtime games and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–25–5.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State {{continued}} its recent dominance over Michigan, winning 28–14. The first <b>half</b> <b>was</b> relatively quiet, with each team only scoring one {{touchdown in the}} first quarter. Michigan's Denard Robinson ran in one from 15 yards out, with Michigan State responding with a one-yard touchdown run by Edwin Baker. After halftime, State's Kirk Cousins threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keshawn Martin to take the lead. The Spartans added more points with another touchdown catch by Martin, this one from 13 yards out. In the fourth quarter, Michigan scored their only points {{of the second half}} with a 34-yard touchdown catch and run by Roy Roundtree. State sealed their victory with a 39-yard interception return touchdown by Isaiah Lewis, handing Michigan their first loss of the season.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the war, the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) {{declared}} its independence from the nascent Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of Operation Senopati. To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other <b>half</b> <b>was</b> tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E
