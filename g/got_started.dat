5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they <b>got</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

25|$|The report {{concluded}} {{that there had been}} errors of judgment pertaining to the Rwanda Armed Forces, but before the genocide only; further errors of judgment about the scale of the threat, {{at the onset of the}} genocide; over-reliance on the UNAMIR mission without awareness that it would be undercut by the United States and other parties; and ineffective diplomacy. Ultimately, it concluded that France had been the foreign power most involved in limiting the scale of the genocide once it <b>got</b> <b>started,</b> though it regretted that more had not been done.|$|E

25|$|After {{a couple}} of years, his skill began {{attracting}} other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really <b>got</b> <b>started.</b> But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|There {{was almost}} a major crisis before the {{settlement}} <b>got</b> <b>started.</b> The only bank in Tampa {{at the time was}} a branch of the Jacksonville-based First National Bank. Due to the stagnant state of commercial business in town, bank management had decided to close the location. When Ignacio Haya heard the news, he visited the bank’s office to find the fixtures and equipment being packed up for shipment back to Jacksonville. Haya explained to branch manager T.C. Taliaferro that he and Ybor would need the services of a local bank to run their operations, and promised that the initial payroll would come to at least $10,000. On his own volition, Taliaferro began unpacking the boxes. The branch remained open and the crisis was averted.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1865, Colonel Currey was {{planning}} a winter campaign against the Indians in eastern Oregon. To prepare, he sent detachments of the 1st Oregon Infantry along with Oregon cavalry units to Camp Alvord in the Alvord Valley; Camp Polk near present-day Sisters; Camp Currey near Silver Lake; Camp Logan and Camp Colfax along the Boise Road east of Canyon City; Camp Wallace; and Camp Lander near Fort Hall in the Idaho Territory. Detachment commanders were instructed to build winter quarters at their posts and prepare for a winter offensive. Winter provisions were to follow in supply wagons. However, {{the end of the}} Civil War in the east had freed up many regular officers for duty in the west, and as a result, Colonel Currey was released from duty in November 1865 along with the men from companies C, D, and E. Lieutenant Colonel Drake was released from service in December, so the planned winter campaign never <b>got</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the second Test was delayed by almost two hours due to rain, but when the match finally <b>got</b> <b>started,</b> England put the West Indies in to bat and took the first wicket with the first ball of the third over, James Anderson bowling Kraigg Brathwaite (1) off his pads. They then lost Devon Smith (15) just {{before the end of}} the morning session, caught behind off the bowling of Chris Jordan. Darren Bravo (35) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1) then fell in quick {{succession}} midway through the afternoon session, before Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood shared a 55-run stand for the fifth wicket as Samuels reached a half-century. Blackwood was trapped LBW by Jordan shortly before the end of play, an original not out decision overturned on review, leaving Denesh Ramdin to join Samuels, who was six short of a century overnight. Samuels later claimed he was inspired to his long innings by Ben Stokes' sledging.|$|E
25|$|The Twenty20 series {{began at}} a packed Chemlsford, and England posted 146-4, owing much to Taylor, who made 77. Australia's reply never <b>got</b> <b>started</b> until some late hitting from Perry and Haynes, but England won by 15 runs despite to loss of Shrubsole to injury to move within one victory {{of winning the}} series. In the next game at the Rose Bowl, Australia batted first and made 127-7, Hazell bowling well to take 2-11 off her 4 overs. England's reply began poorly when they slumped to 9-3, but Lydia Greenway, who made an unbeaten 80 off 64 balls, led England to both victory in the match and series, {{with the number of}} {{commentators}} praising her innings for its quality under pressure. England then thumped a deflated Australia in the final match of the series, taking the Ashes 12-4. Australia could only manage 91-7 off their 20 overs against a very disciplined performance from England's bowlers and fielders, and after the loss of three early wickets, Greenway and Sciver saw England to a comfortable win. Knight, who tore her hamstring in the final match, collected the player of the series award.|$|E
