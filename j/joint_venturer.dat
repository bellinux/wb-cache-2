40|$|A Master's Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The joint venture, is a management strategy that is easily misidentified and so in turn mis-used, thereby considered a panacea for many situations and circumstances both within the construction and other market industries. As a strategy vehicle, the joint venture {{can be used as}} a means to mitigate or obviate the risk associated with a company's or organisation's particular objective or need(s). The joint venture is best defined as a legally separate corporate entity formed by a number of parent-companies with the sole purpose of achieving a common set of objectives with shared ownership and control, utilising both the strengths and weaknesses, for either a definite or indefinite period of time. The formation of the joint venture arises out of the need for another, in a given situation where the potential venturer cannot alone achieve their given objectives(s). This primarily revolves around the need to share risk and utilise the skills, knowledge and resources if a potential partner. Principal reasons are to minimise the risk associated with the rising complexities of modern advancement and technology, to expand one's market geographically, to combine specialist abilities and so collaborate competitively. The correct use of the joint venture strategy in turn necessitated the need to fully comprehend the true nature of the joint venture, specifically with regard to the UK construction industry, and interpret the necessary and critical criteria for success. A clear understanding of the overall joint venture concept was necessary to allow an organisation to predict the determinants of success. The main objectives of this research therefore were to develop an understanding of the conceptual joint venture, and subsequently it's practical implications within the construction industry. A clear and concise formulation of the elements of success was established from an in-depth survey of national contractors within the UK construction industry. The hypotheses tested within the scope of the research revolved around the need for common control and shared ownership, a mutuality of aims and objectives, co-operation and collaboration amongst the partner companies and their respective personnel. A compatibility of partner size and joint venture experience, with an inherent flexibility for adapting to changes and the understanding oftheir respective organisational cultures were also considered within the research. The survey of contractors, and resultant analysis stemmed from the use of an indepth questionnaire detailing and testing the given hypotheses. With the use of the statistical mathematical tool, S. P. S. S, the results and analysis confirmed the following points. The prospective <b>joint</b> <b>venturer</b> must become familiar with and so understand their partners goals and objectives, assessing their willingness to contribute to the ventures success, with a full commitment of resources. There must be an attempt to provide a compatibility of cultures, partner size and experience, with a provision for shared ownership and joint control. The partner companies further need to provide a strong joint venture board, with the due autonomy and freedom to achieve the ventures main objectives. Use of a strong project manager, through which the control and feedback of information is passed is essential. There needs to be a great degree of trust produced amongst the partners with the sharing of information with free access to all. Without these aforementioned components of success, a potential <b>joint</b> <b>venturer</b> may endanger the potential for a successful project...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to foreign equity participation {{and the desire to}} accelerate the transfer of modern technology and management methods has resulted, in many CMEA countries, in a great deal of new legislation to regulate the process of establishing and operating joint ventures with Western companies. Together with the economic reforms taking place in these countries, which have resulted in more freedom to enterprises and their managers and in more decentralized decision-making, this attitude is facilitating the process of creating joint ventures. As joint ventures constitute a new organizational setting between two economic systems, they have become a very 'hot' topic in many different forums, including the mass media. In spite of the growing interest in east-west joint ventures and due to their short history, there are very few completed studies on the subject. Several international organizations, such as UNIDO and ECE, have compiled studies of legislation for joint ventures and organized meetings between managers from both economic systems to discuss the issue. Bilateral studies between various countries and consultancy reports are also available. Nevertheless, there is a vacuum of empirical studies and analyses of the problems faced by partners, especially during the periods of negotiation and operation.

40|$|The thesis {{which follows}} {{is an attempt}} to examine a complex {{organisational}} phenomenon corporate policy within a multinational resource based joint venture. It employs a multidisciplinary conceptual framework which draws on a range of disciplines including Business Policy/Strategy, Organisation Theory and Macroeconomics (see 1. 1). The central concern of the thesis is to "Explain how prevailing political and economic factors have influenced the policy decisions undertaken by the North West Shelf (NWS) <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> throughout critical periods or 'events' in the history of Australia's largest capital project. " This objective is accommodated within {{the main body of the}} thesis along with two other interrelated goals "Production of an original and comprehensive commentary on the history of the North West Shelf project from 1973 to 1986 and the design of a broad conceptual schema to describe the decision making environment of the NWS <b>joint</b> <b>venturers.</b> " (see Figure 3). This schema is ultimately developed into a model with general applications for the study of corporate policy and strategy within multinational resource based joint venture projects (see 8. 3). Policy, Strategy and Environment are the three keynote terms employed in the theoretical base of the study which attempts to highlight the essential connection between them (see 1. 1. 3). The topic of corporate policy and strategy relating to the North. West Shelf joint venture was chosen for a number of reasons, not least the sheer scale and significance of the project for the Australian and Western Australian economies. The NWS project has been given a high media profile since the Woodside joint venture participants (JVP) made their first commercial gas finds off North Western Australia in 1972 (see Introduction) It has also been the subject of extensive parliamentary debate at Federal and State level, with continuing political controversies over government control and high levels of foreign interest in Australia's premium natural gas fields. Federal and West Australian legislative frameworks and policy instruments relating to large scale petroleum and mineral developments are examined in some detail in the thesis (see Chapter 4). The essential interaction between corporate and public policies (host governments and multinational <b>joint</b> <b>venturers),</b> is also an important focal point of the study. To date no comprehensive historical commentary has been produced to describe the planning and development of Western Australia's largest resource project: in terms of capital invested (A 12 billion by 1995) (1987 dollars) and revenue from sales of hydrocarbons, piped natural gas and 1 iquified natural gas (LNG) to domestic and export markets. The thesis accommodates this goal through the use of published sources and interview material (see 1. 1 and 1. 2) within a unique theoretical framework. Interview respondents provided both general background on the NWS venture and a variety of perspectives on a series of 'critical events' in the history of the project. Analysis of these 'events', through comparison of interview responses and information from a range of published sources, provides an essential insight into the policy decisions taken by the NWS <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> during critical periods in planning and development of the project. The central reference point in the thesis is the 'Conceptual Map' which is comprised of a series of schematic diagrams outlining various sectors of the North West Shelf project organisation's internal and external environment. The map and relevant concepts are used to demonstrate how policy outputs from the NWS joint venture influence and are influenced by other organisations or interest groups within the project organisation's internal and external environment. The NWS project organisation is seen to be linked to a series of other influential organisations and government bodies through an interorganisational network. This follows Odell (1983) who developed the concept of an international petroleum network to highlight essential connections between corporate and governmental bodies operating at each level within the vertically integrated international petroleum industry (see 3. 1). The network concept is usefully employed in the thesis to illustrate the influence which World level (multinational), National and State level interests can hold in relation to corporate policy and strategy within a multinational joint venture project. The thesis is structured in a form which allows Chapters 3 to 8 to pursue and develop a series of discrete themes relating to the NWS project. These are bound together by the theoretical framework and conceptual schema set out in Chapters 1 and 2. In broad terms the content of the study breaks down as follows: Introduction - (i) Historical background to the NWS project; (ii) the structure of the NWS joint venture, (iii) chronology and overview of key events influencing the planning of the project. Chapters 1 and 2 cover the theoretical structure and methodological basis of the study. The contribution of various writers to the multidisciplinary conceptual framework of the thesis is discussed in detail. Chapter 3 covers the worldwide petroleum network, the structure of the Australian oil and gas industry, the position of the NWS project as an exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and the growing international trade in this product. Chapter 4 is primarily concerned with the legislative and public policy framework, which has been developed at Federal and State level to govern the development of large scale petroleum and minerals projects in Australia. Provisions with particular relevance to the NWS project are considered at length. Chapter 5 is a simple but detailed description of the Conceptual Map, highlighting the influence of a series of key external bodies on the corporate policies of the NWS <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> over specified periods of time. Chapters 6 and 7 provide a detailed analysis of three 'critical events' identified by interview respondents as having an important impact on the future development of the NWS project. Each event is set within a wider context of political and economic change within Western Australia and Australia. Major macroeconomic shifts in relevant international markets are also considered. In the final chapter information presented in Chapters 3, 6 and 7 is updated bringing important themes pursued in these sections through to the end of 1988. A simple model of 'Policy Making Environment' for multinational resource based joint ventures is presented incorporating major features drawn from the conceptual map employed throughout the thesis. Final conclusions are presented in order to draw together both the theoretical and thematic content of the work and identify key areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|Conclusion] We have {{explored}} two {{dimensions of the}} Australian OHS statutes which enable statutory OHS duties to reach more than one employer or self-employed person within a corporate group or network. First, most of the OHS statutes contain provisions extending the reach of employer’s duty beyond the employer’s employees. One legislative technique is to deem contractors and their employees to be employees of the principal contractor. Another imposes duties on employers and self-employed persons to persons who are not employees, so that employers and self-employed persons can {{be responsible for the}} OHS of firms, and those they engage, lower in the contractual chain. These duties are non-delegable, meaning that the principal contractor cannot seek to delegate OHS duties to firms lower in the contractual chain. Second, new Victorian ‘shadow officer’ provisions can be applied to remove difficulties and doubt as to the liability of partners in a partnership, officers of unincorporated associations, <b>joint</b> <b>venturers,</b> and holding and subsidiary companies within corporate groups. While the provisions can be argued simply to confirm that a partner who fails to take reasonable care in relation to OHS will be guilty of an offence, we demonstrate that there are very real benefits to having ‘shadow officer’ provisions which remove uncertainties about the liability of unincorporated associations, joint ventures and corporate groups. Perhaps most significantly, the Victorian corporate officer provisions have the potential to extend liability to individuals and other entities within organisational structures, where those individuals and entities make or participate in making decisions that affect the whole or a substantial part of the organisation’s business, and are responsible for an OHS offence having been committed, due to their failure to take reasonable care. We suggest that similar provisions should be included in all OHS statutes, to overcome {{at least some of the}} barriers limiting group responsibility for OHS statutory duties...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{joint ventures}} {{which have been}} established between Greek enterprises and enterprises from Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Russia. An international joint venture (IJV) is an enterprise established between two or more companies, one of which exercises its entrepreneurial activities in a foreign country. The core set of questions that this thesis addresses consist of motives {{for the establishment of}} joint ventures, partner selection criteria, control and conflict inside a joint venture, stability and performance. Another issue addressed is that of the problems which <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> face, as identified by Greek businessmen and academics. This framework is deployed upon an extensive body of primary source data gathered in 1994 by field work methods, using an administrated questionnaire largely within the Greek parent companies. Our research relates to evidence on 44 Greek enterprises, groups of companies, or individuals who established joint ventures with Eastern European partners after 1989. The questionnaire design is based on the notion that the expansion of the domestic boundaries of the firm abroad, and its decision to establish an IJV are the outcomes of strategic, financial and country specific motives. The key results of the thesis are that successful joint ventures in Eastern Europe have the following characteristics: 1. Dominant control by the Greek partner over the IJV, when the Eastern European partner is a bureaucrat. 2. Low perceived conflict as regards intensity and frequency over dimensions like transfer of knowledge. 3. High stability as measured by the percentage increase in share capital held by the Greek partner and by resistance to transformation to wholly owned subsidiary status of the IJV. 4. Good perceived financial performance. 5. Evolution of the IJV such that the Eastern European partner increasingly takes on a managerial role and becomes attuned to managerial modes of behaviour. 6.

40|$|Joint ventures are {{a popular}} form of {{enterprise}} {{structure in the}} resources sector in Australia. Despite the absence of hard data, {{it is estimated that}} at least half the expenditure on mineral exploration and virtually all petroleum exploration in Australia {{in recent years has been}} through joint venture arrangements. So it is elsewhere, and in other fields. In resource exploration and exploitation, engineering and construction, manufacturing, and research and development, various forms of joint ventures are being relied on increasingly as vehicles for business. In competition policy terms, the creation and activities of joint ventures present special. problems. Whereas competition policy seeks to encourage competition between participants in the marketplace, joint venture arrangements involve cooperation between participants, often resulting in a lessening of competition. There are advantages and disadvantages to be weighed; a balancing test involving beneficial economic effects, and anti-competitive detriments. The task of legislators and competition authorities (in Australia, the Trade Practices Commission) has been and remains to develop and implement a framework which allows joint ventures to develop in an economically beneficial way, whilst at the same time circumscribing their anti-competitive effects. The object of this paper is to examine the approach to this problem which has been developed in Australia, and distilled in the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("the Act"), in the context of resources joint ventures. It is timely to undertake such an examination The Act has now been in force for 15 years and its principles have been applied in a number of determinations, particularly in the last two years. I have adopted what I hope is a relatively straightforward approach to this task. First, in Part 2 of the paper, I attempt to identify the characteristics of resources joint ventures in Australia which are significant in the context of competition policy. Also in this part, I outline the costs and benefits of joint ventures, as they are perceived in competition theory. Secondly, in Part 3 of the paper, I describe the competition provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, and the adjudication provisions set out in Part VII. Whilst these will be familiar to many readers, they are included here not only for the sake of completeness and the aid of those unfamiliar with the Act, but also because a detailed understanding of these provisions is essential to the analysis and discussion which follows. These provisions embody the regulatory approach to the problem, which is in essence to subject joint ventures to the full spectrum of competition laws (with limited exceptions), but subject to an adjudication process which permits authorised contraventions on public benefit grounds. In Part 4, the meaning of some concepts which are essential to the practical application of the competition and authorisation provisions (namely, "competition", "market", "public benefit" and "dominance") is explained. This is done by reference to decided cases and also to the determinations of the Trade Practices Commission ("the Commission") in the case studies discussed in the Schedule to this paper. Part 5 of the paper examines the competition issues which arise upon the formation of a joint venture. This involves a consideration of Section 50 of the Act (which proscribes mergers or acquisitions leading to market dominance) in relation to the <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> individually (the "parents") and the joint venture itself (the "child"). In Part 6, I examine some specific provisions of resources joint venture agreements which have the potential to contravene the Act. These are, namely, area of mutual interest, assignment and non-competition provisions. Also in this part, the trade practices implications of joint venturers' cooperative marketing and joint acquisition arrangements are considered. Throughout the paper, extensive references are made to various determinations of the Commission made since the inception of the Act, which involve resources joint ventures. Summaries of these determinations and the issues which they have considered are set out in the Schedule. These cases provide practical illustrations of the types of competition issues to which resources joint ventures give rise, and the public benefits which have been accepted as outweighing anti-competitive detriment. It is important to emphasize at the outset that competition policy does not operate in a vacuum. Not only does the cause of competition require to be subordinated from time to time to the greater economic benefits which flow from joint ventures; it must also take its place in the ranks of other government policies, not all of which are compatible with it. Examples of this dilemma can be found in the paper; specifically with respect to government policies dealing with crude oil marketing and tenement licensing. Reconciliation of these conflicting policy goals is of course the daunting task of the bureaucracy and the legislature. It is also important to acknowledge the matters which I have not addressed in this paper. First, I have confined my analysis to those provisions of agreements or types of conduct which are an integral part of, or peculiar to, resources joint ventures. This is not to say however that this paper presents a comprehensive picture of the interface between resources joint ventures and competition law. Many activities engaged in by <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> with respect to their joint ventures may involve anti-competitive forms of conduct (such as exclusive dealing, tying, predatory pricing or refusals to deal) which invoke the provisions of the Act. However, these forms of conduct are not peculiar to joint ventures, and it is not within the scope of this paper to deal with them. Secondly, the paper is confined to an analysis of the Australian Trade Practices Act. The extra-territorial application of foreign competition and anti-trust laws is not addressed. (2) Thirdly, the paper does not contain any comparative analysis of competition laws in other countries. The issues which are discussed in this paper have been addressed (to varying extents) in the United States, Canada, Japan and the EEC nations. Had time and space permitted, it would have been of interest to compare the approaches adopted by these various countries, and to consider whether an alternative approach should be adopted here. (3) Shortly before this paper was completed, the High Court handed down its decision in the Queensland Wire case (4) The decision in that case has signalled the court's preparedness to adopt a purposive approach to the application of the Act, bearing in mind its objective of fostering competition. This, coupled with the more visible and assertive role being adopted by the Commission, has heightened and reinforced the need for <b>joint</b> <b>venturers</b> to have the Act, and competition policy generally, firmly in mind when contemplating their agreements and arrangementsRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
