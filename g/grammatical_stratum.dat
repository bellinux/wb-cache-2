They tend to use two or more languages in their daily conversation, even in market places. In this analysis, the writer observed the visitors. The visitors were Javanese and Chinese-Indonesians. She identified the difference of their ethnicity from their appearance and they way they talked to the vendors. The objective was to find the codes, the code mixing form, to classify the code-mixing items into parts of speech, and then to find the similarities and the differences of code -mixing used by male visitors and that used by female visitors. In doing her research, the writer recorded the spoken language produced by the visitors. She chose 20 (twenty) recorded data from {{the male and female}} visitors.

She recorded the conversation which took more or less 5 to 10 minutes. After the analysis, she found out that Javanese code occurred more often than the Indonesian code in the conversation among visitors toward vendors. In terms of code mixing form, the visitors do code-mixing in the form of words more often than in the form of phrases. Also, function words are mostly produced by the visitors in the conversation. Finally, the writer found out that the Chinese-Indonesian and the Javanese visitors were similar in using the codes, codemixing forms, and code-mixing items (which belong to parts of speech); but they were different in the frequency. Compared to ethnicity, the writer discovered that gender differences have a greater role in setting up code-mixing...|$|E
