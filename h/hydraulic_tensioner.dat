50|$|The new four-cylinder, {{oversquare}} one-litre water-cooled Opel OHV engine weighed only 96 kg and was {{the first}} all-new engine developed by Opel since before the war. The side-mounted camshaft was driven not through gear-cogs but using a single chain with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner,</b> the valve train employing rocker-arms and light-weight hollow rods. The arrangement was low on weight and on friction, permitting engine speeds above 6,000 rpm. The pistons were formed from an aluminium-alloy and incorporated a bimetal expansion strip to ensure uniform thermal expansion. The three-bearing forged crankshaft was of more traditional construction. The carefully designed aluminium inlet manifold provided for efficient feed of the fuel-mixture to the cylinders and helped provide the engine with good fuel economy characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner</b> to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the water pump housing cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|E
5000|$|Created as {{a refined}} luxury engine with {{improved}} {{power over the}} EA82T, Subaru introduced the ER series engine in 1988 exclusively to be featured in the Subaru Alcyone VX. Like the EA series engines, the ER series engine featured 2-valve cylinder heads with hydraulic lash adjusters and the block shared the same bore and stroke. While recognised as bearing many similarities to the Subaru EA82 engine, there are numerous differences in design between the two engines and {{a large portion of}} parts are unique to the ER27. The oil and water pumps are unique to the ER27, sharing similar bolt patterns and design to the EA82, but being of a higher flow in both cases.The intake manifold uses a two piece design with a lower section bolting to the heads containing the coolant bridge, injectors and various vacuum lines. The upper intake manifold then bolts to the lower section and is unlike the EA82 or EJ22 [...] "spider" [...] manifold designs in that there is no central plenum chamber. The valve timing system is belt-drive using two individual timing belts, curiously one belt uses a spring tensioner (like the EA82) whilst the other uses a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner</b> (like the EJ22). Both JDM and USDM versions of the ER27 used multi-point electronic fuel injection. The ER27 designation was the first time Subaru incorporated the engine's displacement into the series name and all future engines have retained this nomenclature.|$|E

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} focused on an {{evaluation}} of a preload lost in a tappered joint. The analyzed bolts are preloaded by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner.</b> When the tensioner is removed, the joint is established and the preload in bolt is decreased. The analysisis carried out on axisymmetry model of joint in ANSYS Workbench 15, a finite element method is implemented in that software. The evaluation of the preload lost is made for a used range of ratio of clamped length to a nominal diameter of bolt. Geometry and material assumptions are defined. Before preloading of bolts to a desired value the process of stabilization preloading must be done otherwise outlines of the analysis are not applicable.

40|$|Abstract. Disc-rotor is {{composed}} of certain number of discs which are fastened as a single-shaft rotor by tie-rods. The rods must be very carefully tensioned {{in the course of}} rotor assembly to ensure a circumferentially uniform prestress, thus acceptable run-out value, as otherwise the rotor will be susceptible to vibrations particularly during start-up. Uniform prestress is also beneficial to improve the fatigue life of the rods. Initial preload for one rod is calculated and the appropriate tightening scheme is determined by finite element analysis, considering relaxation and elastic interaction.

40|$|On May 6, 2010, NASA {{launched}} {{the first successful}} integrated flight test, Pad Abort- 1, of the Orion Project from the White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico. This test demonstrated the ability to perform an emergency pad abort of a full-scale 4. 8 m diameter, 8200 kg crew capsule. During development of the critical separation mechanisms for this flight test, various challenges were overcome related to environments definition, installation complications, separation joint retraction speed, thruster ordnance development issues, load path validation and significant design loads increases. The Launch Abort System retention and release (LAS R&R) mechanism consisted of 6 discrete structural connections between the LAS and the crew module (CM) simulator, each of which had a preloaded tension tie, Superbolt torque-nut and frangible nut. During the flight test, the frangible nuts were pyrotechnically split, permitting the CM to separate from the LAS. The LAS separation event was the driving case in the shock environment for many co-located hardware items. During development testing, {{it was necessary to}} measure the source shock during the separation event so the predicted shock environment could be validated and used for certification testing of multiple hardware items. The Lockheed Martin test team measured the source separation shock due to the LAS R&R function, which dramatically decreased the predicted environment by 90 % at 100 Hz. During development testing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner</b> was used to preload the joint; however, the joint relaxation with the tensioner proved unsatisfactory so the design was modified to include a Superbolt torque-nut. The observed preload creep during lab testing was 4 % after 30 days, with 2. 5 % occurring in the first 24 hours. The conversion of strain energy (preload) to kinetic energy (retraction) was measured to be 50 - 75 %. Design features and careful monitoring of multiple strain gauges on each tension tie allowed a pure tensile load to be applied after stacking at the launch pad. Following installation, preload in each joint was monitored for 24 hours. Due to unforeseen complications and the influence of temperature on the portable data acquisition system, the team encountered difficulty in tracking the joint relaxation. In some cases, bond-line failure of the strain gauges occurred...|$|E
40|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{were developed}} long time (let’s remember that Archimedes – 287 - 212 BC – invented the water screw). Nowadays, bolted joints {{are used in}} almost all sectors of the industry. But in spite of having been an important machine part for centuries, problems may be encountered with them. They are so common that they are taken for granted and too often, not analyzed as deeply as it should be. The wrong tightening {{is one of the}} most frequent causes of ductile rupture and by far the most frequent cause of fatigue failure. The tightening operation is never easy. It is necessary to pay particular attention to the choice of the tightening tool, the process and the control method. The tightening operation may itself cause damage on parts. The tightening load must not be too low, or excessive or not equally distributed among the bolts. These three defects can even be made on the same bolted joint! This impacts badly the performance of the assembly and leads to a shorter lifespan. If insufficient precautions are taken, the real tightening preload on all the bolts will not fit well with the requirements and would be badly distributed. Consequently, the practical conditions are quite different from the hypothesizes which are taken for the initial calculations (analytics or FEM) at the design stage. Thus, the results of the calculations of bolted joints cannot be considered as accurate and reliable. Practically, there are several means to tighten a bolt. The two ways most frequently used are torque wrench and hydraulic bolt tensioner. Torque wrench involves exerting a torque to the bolt head or the nut. Hydraulic bolt tensioner applies a traction load directly on the bolt. It is well known that bolt tensioners give better accuracy and homogeneity in the final tightening load than the torque method, but the tension load applied with the tensioner must be higher than the final remaining tightening load. So, the paper focusses on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner</b> to show how the tightening load can be obtained from the applied tension load and to propose a way to optimize and secure the tightening process. However, for the reasons above mentioned it appears necessary to first make a general description of technical aspects of bolted joints. What really happens when tightening with torque wrench or with bolt tensioner is explained...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} modelling aspects {{related to}} dynamic analysis of deep water drilling risers. These risers {{must have a}} heave compensator that maintains a near constant tension independent of platform motions. Traditional riser analysis will apply constant top tension or a simple spring-damper model that may give approximate tension variation. The present thesis describes an alternative improved analysis procedure that consists of the following steps: Global riser analysis including the calculation of the dynamic stroke of the heave compensator from platform motions and riser dynamics. A "pipe-in-pipe" approach is used to represent the hydraulic cylinders. Calculation of dynamic tension variation from {{an analysis of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tensioner</b> system. The dynamic stroke found from the first analysis is applied as known piston motions in this analysis. Identification of parameters in a simple model for dynamic tension variation from the results from the second analysis. Use of the simple model in a second global riser analysis. The difference between the two riser analyses can hence be found. An integrated model of the hydraulic system and marine riser could preferably have been developed. This type of model can be based on the two computer programs applied in this study, but a real time communication between the programs must be established. This approach has not been attempted in the present study. A case study with data from a real situation is reported. The data shows that the constant tension model is only valid for small heave motions, while a spring-damper tensioner model can give almost correct results for tension variation. However, a parametric model must be tuned for each case. All data used in this study have been taken from the platform Aker Spitsbergen. The heave compensator on the platform was instrumented for recording of response data. It is primarily the acceleration measurement system on the Direct Acting Tensioner (DAT) that has been of interest. The main conclusion based on these measurements is that the accelerations are higher than 1. 5 ms - 2 The design criteria for the cylinders in the heave compensating system have been that {{they should be able to}} withstand a lateral acceleration of 1. 5 ms - 2 evenly distributed along the cylinder. The measurements confirm that there is a significant response component that is very likely to be caused by slamming loads.   As a result of inadequate design criteria all cylinders in corresponding applications are modified and replaced with cylinders that are designed to withstand higher accelerations. Tension variations from the DAT system are also higher than previously assumed. These tension variations should be taken into account in riser design analyses for existing and future platforms.
