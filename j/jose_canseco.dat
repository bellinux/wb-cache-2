He {{is also one of}} only four {{baseball}} players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are <b>José</b> <b>Canseco,</b> Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was born}} in Phoenix, Arizona, to David and Charlotte Affeldt. His father {{was a member of}} the United States Air Force, and Affeldt lived in Guam, Merced, California, and Spokane, Washington, growing up. While in Merced, Affeldt and his father would {{frequently}} attend Oakland Athletics games, and Affeldt enjoyed watching Mark McGwire, <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco,</b> and Dave Stewart. Affeldt attended Northwest Christian High School, a Division 2-B school in Colbert, Washington. He participated in three sports while there, but it was baseball that drove several major league scouts to the school to see him pitch. He graduated in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Ken Griffey, Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, <b>José</b> <b>Canseco,</b> Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, {{playing the}} ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman sang a song over the end credits. The guest stars were {{recorded}} over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, {{and was the}} first to beat The Cosby Show in the ratings on its original airing. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{playing for}} the White Sox, Martínez also spent playing time as an utility with the Indians and made his last major league {{appearance}} with the Angels in 1995.

25|$|<b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco</b> {{released}} a book, , in 2005. In it, he wrote positively about steroids and made various claims—among them, that McGwire had used performance-enhancing drugs since the 1980s and that Canseco had personally injected him with them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, Rodriguez {{admitted}} to using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers. During the investigations into PED use earlier in the decade, several other former Rangers players were criticized for possible use of performance-enhancers. These included notable '90s sluggers <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco,</b> Iván Rodríguez, Juan González, and Rafael Palmeiro.|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as a writer {{covering}} the Athletics, Gomez, a lifetime baseball fan, covered major stories such as the Cincinnati Reds victory over the defending World Series champion A's in 1990, <b>José</b> <b>Canseco's</b> trade to the Texas Rangers for Rubén Sierra in 1992, Rickey Henderson's 1,000th stolen base, and other moments of relative importance to the team.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for win: John Rich and Mark McGrath {{were able}} to {{effectively}} organize their book and performance, and despite criticism for <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> awful performance in the stage play and Meat Loaf's failure to actually show the book to the audience, guest judge Holly Robinson Peete thought their concept was very original, age appropriate and entertaining.|$|R
50|$|Flanagan's only postseason {{experience}} with the Blue Jays was a Game 4 start in the 1989 AL Championship Series on October 7. He pitched 4⅓ innings, giving up five runs and three homers.

25|$|<b>José</b> <b>Canseco</b> Capas Jr. (born July 2, 1964), is a Cuban-American former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and {{designated}} hitter. Canseco {{has admitted}} using performance-enhancing drugs during his playing career, and in 2005 wrote a tell-all book, , {{in which he}} claimed {{that the vast majority}} of MLB players use steroids. After retiring from Major League Baseball, he also competed in boxing and mixed martial arts.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco</b> {{released}} a tell-all book, , about {{his experience with}} steroids in his career. In the book, Canseco named several other players, including Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez and Jason Giambi, as steroid users. The book caused great controversy, {{and most of these}} players have claimed Canseco's implications to be false, though McGwire and Giambi have since admitted to using PEDs, and Palmeiro has tested positive.|$|E
50|$|In <b>José</b> <b>Canseco's</b> 2005 book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, he {{mentions}} {{that he believes}} Tejada might have taken steroids. He claims to have spoken to him about them and the next season seeing him at spring training looking more defined. He never claims to have injected him with them, like he did with Palmeiro, McGwire and other ballplayers.|$|R
50|$|The steroids {{rumors and}} facts {{resulted}} in several de facto bans {{from the game}} by players who were either certifiable or suspected users of steroids, and significant doubt has been cast {{about the quality of}} various baseball records set since at least the early 1990s. Some people base their opinion on <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> tell-all book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big.|$|R
50|$|He {{was called}} to Capitol Hill to testify about steroid use in March 2005, not as a {{suspected}} user {{but rather as a}} vocal opponent. He has said that <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> statistics should be thrown out due to his admitted use of steroids, and has also said that unless he can refute allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs, Roger Clemens should be stripped of the four Cy Young Awards he has won since 1997.|$|R

25|$|On December 13, 2007, <b>José</b> <b>Canseco</b> and Jorge Delgado {{were cited}} in the Mitchell Report (The Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball). On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in Jason Grimsley's {{unsealed}} affidavit as a user of steroids. Canseco and Grimsley were teammates on the 2000 New York Yankees.|$|E
5000|$|On January 11, 2010, Wilstein's suspicions and <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> {{allegations}} of McGwire's steroid use were confirmed by Mark McGwire {{in a statement}} to and interview with the Associated Press and later interviews with Bob Costas and others by McGwire. [...] Upon the news, many sports columnists and media spoke of Wilstein's vindication and CNN.com asked Wilstein to provide his views in an op-ed piece. Wilstein wrote that McGwire should be banned from Major League Baseball for life and that his acts hurt baseball more than those of Pete Rose.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>José</b> <b>Canseco's</b> book, , Canseco {{suggested}} that Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and {{suggested that}} he used steroids, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox. While not addressing the allegations directly, Clemens stated: [...] "I {{could care less about}} the rules" [...] and [...] "I've talked to some friends of his and I've teased them that when you're under house arrest and have ankle bracelets on, {{you have a lot of}} time to write a book." [...] Clemens admitted to using the prescription pain reliever Vioxx before it was withdrawn from the market.|$|R
5000|$|While Trump was {{critical}} of <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> failure to bring in any donors, he even more heavily criticised Richard Hatch for bringing him back after claiming during the initial boardroom that Jose worked the hardest on the task. Trump hinted that Gary Busey should have been brought back instead of Jose, since his attempt to promote the sale while playing {{the character of the}} [...] "Pepperoni Prophet" [...] had ultimately achieved nothing. Ultimately, Richard was spared due to his having been the top fundraiser on Backbone, and Trump having a policy of never firing the top fundraiser on a task.|$|R
25|$|On June 12, Carlos Peña hit a {{home run}} for the sixth {{consecutive}} game. This broke the team record for homers in consecutive games, set by <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco,</b> who went deep in five straight games during the 1999 season. Peña's streak was snapped the next day, going hitless in four at-bats. Peña had been struggling throughout the season offensively, and some called for him to be benched as recently as the week prior.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 2006, Soriano stole {{second base}} {{in the first inning}} to become the fourth player to join the 40–40 club, after <b>José</b> <b>Canseco,</b> Barry Bonds, and Alex Rodriguez. Many {{considered}} Soriano's 40-40 season to be the only one 'clean', as Canseco, Bonds and Rodriguez were all involved in the steroid controversy, he is also {{the only one of the}} four reaching the feat in playing at home. Six days later he became the first player to reach 40 home runs, 40 stolen bases and 40 doubles in one season.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1998 season, the Blue Jays {{acquired}} closer Randy Myers and slugger <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco.</b> Gaston was replaced with former Blue Jay Tim Johnson, a relative unknown as a manager. Despite mediocre hitting, strong pitching led by Clemens' second straight pitching Triple Crown (20–6, 2.65 ERA, 271 strikeouts) sparked the Blue Jays to an 88–74 record – their first winning season since 1993. However, this was only good enough to finish a distant third, 26 games behind the New York Yankees, who posted one of the greatest records in all of baseball history at 114–48. They were, however, in contention for the wildcard spot until the final week.|$|E
500|$|... "It was a {{thing of}} beauty", {{teammate}} Marlon Byrd said. [...] "I loved it." [...] Kinsler's dual feat {{was the first in}} the modern baseball era. The last major league player to have six hits in a game while hitting for the cycle was William Farmer Weaver, for the Louisville Colonels on August 12, 1890. Kinsler's 13 total bases were also one base shy of <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> June 13, 1994, team record. Only three other players in the prior 55 years had had six hits, five runs, and four extra-base hits in a game, the most recent having been Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2002.|$|R

25|$|Canseco {{was born}} in Havana, Cuba, the son of Jose Sr. and Barbara Canseco. He has a twin brother, Ozzie. When Fidel Castro came into power in 1959, Jose Sr., a {{territory}} manager for the oil and gasoline corporation Esso {{as well as a}} part-time English teacher, lost his job and eventually his home. The family was allowed to leave Cuba in 1965, when the twins were barely 1 year old, and settled in the Miami area, where Jose Sr. became a territory manager for another oil and gasoline concern, Amoco, and a part-time security guard. The younger <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco</b> played baseball at Miami Coral Park High School, where he failed to make the varsity team until his senior year. He was named Most Valuable Player of the junior varsity team in his junior year, and of the varsity team the following year. He graduated in 1982 and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics.|$|E
25|$|On July 4, three Rays were {{selected}} {{to play for the}} American League in the 2010 MLB All-Star Game on July 13. Left fielder Carl Crawford and third baseman Evan Longoria were both named starters by way of fan vote, while pitcher David Price was elected by the players. This was Crawford's fourth selection to the Midsummer Classic, Longoria's third, and Price's first. All three became the first Rays to be starting players in the All-Star Game. Price was named the starting pitcher for the American League the day before the game. <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco</b> would have been the first in 1999, but missed out due to an injury. Longoria had the opportunity in 2009, but also had to withdraw due to an injury. Closer Rafael Soriano was added to the roster on July 6, his first-ever selection, giving the Rays four all-stars. Soriano replaced New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera after it was announced that Rivera would not play because of injuries. Soriano was picked by having the next-highest total of votes on the players' ballot.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2005 season, <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco,</b> in his {{controversial}} book , {{claimed to have}} personally injected Rodríguez with anabolic steroids during their time as teammates on the Texas Rangers. Rodríguez denied the allegations {{and said he was}} [...] "in shock" [...] over Canseco's claims. Asked by a reporter four years later whether his name is on the list of 104 players who tested positive for steroids during baseball's 2003 survey testing, Rodríguez responded, [...] "Only God knows." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2008, Clemens {{appeared}} before a Congressional committee, along with Brian McNamee, and swore under oath {{that he did}} not take steroids; {{that he did not}} discuss HGH with McNamee; that he was not at a party at <b>José</b> <b>Canseco's</b> where steroids were the topic of conversation; that he was only injected with B-12 and lidocaine; and that he never told Pettitte that he had taken HGH. This last point was in contradiction to testimony Pettite had given under oath on February 4, 2008, wherein Pettitte said he repeated to McNamee a conversation Pettitte had with Clemens. During this conversation, Pettitte said Clemens had told him that McNamee had injected Clemens with human growth hormone. Pettitte said McNamee reacted angrily, saying that Clemens [...] "shouldn't have done that." ...|$|R
50|$|On October 26, 2009, Tony La Russa {{agreed to}} come back for a 15th season as manager of the Cardinals, thus {{extending}} his record for longest-serving manager in Cardinal history. Pitching coach and long-time LaRussa partner Dave Duncan, who earlier in 2009 had expressed displeasure with the franchise after his son Chris was traded, also agreed to return. However, hitting coach Hal McRae was fired after five seasons with the Cardinals and replaced with former Cardinal and former home run champion Mark McGwire. McGwire's hiring as hitting coach marked the slugger's first job in baseball since his retirement eight years prior. It was also his return to the public eye following his implication as a steroids user in <b>Jose</b> <b>Canseco's</b> book and his controversial 2005 appearance at the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's inquiry into the steroid scandal.|$|R
50|$|The A's {{got another}} {{run in the}} seventh when Dave Henderson doubled and scored on <b>José</b> <b>Canseco's</b> single. The Blue Jays got that run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Tony Fernández doubled and scored on pinch-hitter Pat Borders' single. Rick Honeycutt ran into trouble in the eighth. Manny Lee singled and went to second on a ground out by Junior Felix. Honeycutt walked Moseby, {{bringing}} the tying run to the plate in the person of Mookie Wilson. With two on and one out, LaRussa summoned his closer, Dennis Eckersley. Eck induced a fielder's choice ground out by Wilson that scored Lee then faced 1989 home run champion Fred McGriff, who had not hit a homer in more than a month. McGriff won the battle, lining a single to center field that scored Wilson, but when Eckersley got George Bell to pop up for the third out, the A's still led by one with just an inning to play.|$|R
