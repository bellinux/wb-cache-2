40|$|Low-cost {{airlines}} are {{seen by some}} {{as one of the}} best things that have happened within contemporary travel. The clever business idea of offering significantly lower prices by taking out all the extras in a short-haul flight, along with innovative cost-cutting measures, was successful in the USA as early as 1973 when South-west Airlines flew her first low-cost flight. This paper asks whether this scenario has potential in Southeast Asia. According to many analysts, the environment in South-east Asia is simply not suitable for budget carriers. Governments are still very protective of their <b>flag-carriers,</b> there is a lack of cheap, secondary airports, South-east Asians are not wealthy enough to fly, and other cost-cutting measures like Internet distribution cannot easily be replicated. This paper argues that the opposite is true. There might not be 'open-skies' in South-east Asia, but the governments appear willing to nurture low-cost airlines to coexist with their <b>flag-carriers.</b> The number of airports that could serve as gateways for these airlines is more numerous than expected. The South-east Asian population is getting wealthy enough to fly and there also exists a significant market if the low-cost carriers can take advantage of it...|$|R

500|$|The {{multiplayer}} mode allows two, three, or {{four players}} {{to compete against}} each other in five different types of split screen deathmatch games: Normal, You Only Live Twice, The Living Daylights (Flag Tag), The Man With the Golden Gun, and Licence to Kill. Normal is a basic deathmatch mode in which the main objective is to kill opponents as many times as possible. It can be played as a free-for-all game or in teams. In You Only Live Twice, players only have two lives before they are eliminated from the game, and Licence to Kill is a mode in which players die from a single hit with any weapon. In The Man With the Golden Gun, a single Golden Gun, which is capable of killing opponents with only one shot, is placed in a fixed location on the map; once the Golden Gun is picked up, the only way to re-acquire it is to kill the player holding it. The player with the Golden Gun is unable to pick up body armour while opponents can. In The Living Daylights, a [...] "flag" [...] is placed in a fixed location on the map, and the player who holds it the longest wins. The <b>flag-carrier</b> cannot use weapons but can still collect them to keep opponents from stocking ammunition. Aspects of each gametype can be customised, including the chosen map, class of weapons, and winning condition. As players progress through the single player mode, new maps and characters are unlocked in the multiplayer mode.|$|E

Many international airlines halted flights to the capital however some carriers resumed some flights on Sunday 7 November. Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport normally handles around 900 flights per day and a spokesman for Soekarno-Hatta Airport, confirmed that the capital's airport remained fully open. <b>Flag-carrier</b> Garuda Indonesia and Lion Air still operated international flights out of Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport. Garuda Indonesia spokesman Pujobroto told news portal kompas.com, [...] "There has been no notice to airman {{so far from the}} aviation authorities which says the airport is affected by the volcanic ash.

AirAsia (Malaysia) had previously suspended flights into Yogyakarta and Solo and Silkair (Singapore) had suspended their operations into Solo. Airport operations at Yogyakarta's Adisucipto airport had already been closed or suspended on many occasions due to concerns from ash fall and limited visibility. Garuda and Sriwijaya Air canceled all flights to Yogyakarta until 9 November due to the ash plume. Pujobroto, vice president of corporate communications, Garuda Indonesia announced that with flight conditions between Yogyakarta and Solo also still uncertain, flights from Yogyakarta will not be diverted to Solo and reiterated that there had not been any official declaration that Soekarno Hatta airport had been affected by Merapi's volcanic ashes and nor was it closed down.

The premise being that air carriers from the PRC and Taiwan were prevented crossing paths at any Japanese airports.

This updated second edition of Flying High in a Competitive Industry begins with an analysis of the airline industry and its key trends, moving on to a broad outline of SIA's strategic drivers of success. Empirical research was conducted at SIA to gain a deeper understanding of its strategy, core competencies and internal organisation, innovation processes and human resource practices, in order to instill strategy lessons that can inform the strategies of any organisation competing in intensely competitive industries. This book ends with some strategic lessons that apply to any organisation that aims to achieve sustainable success in hypercompetitive markets...|$|R
500|$|The 747 {{enjoyed a}} fairly smooth {{introduction}} into service, overcoming concerns that some airports {{would not be}} able to accommodate an aircraft that large. Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved. After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service. [...] Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity. [...] While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747. Nonetheless, many <b>flag-carriers</b> purchased the 747 due to its iconic status [...] "even if it made no sense economically" [...] to operate. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|R

40|$|Background: Since {{the airline}} {{deregulation}} {{was completed in}} 1997, a new business model has emerged in the European civil aviation industry. It has caused {{a shift in the}} way people travel within Europe. The airlines operating under this new business model known as point-to-point, have created a new outlet for commercial passenger travel and raised concerns for established flag carriers. Problem: This study is of great importance {{due to the fact that}} people are traveling more frequently and wish to do so quicker and more efficiently. With so many options to choose from and cost being an important decision maker for both companies and consumers, a study of this industry in terms of competition, price and service quality is of great impor-tance. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and describe whether or not changes in the competitive landscape of the European civil aviation industry are related to the movement of economy class prices. The thesis also looks at whether or not changes in the competitive landscape are related to changes in service quality in the same industry. Both <b>flag-carriers</b> and low-cost carriers in terms of their business models will be investigated. Method: The method chosen for this study was of an integrated approach based solely on secondary data due to the sheer size and scope of this industry. This study investigated the two major business models of this industry through routes to the major cities and capitals of Western Europe from Stockholm Arlanda airport and Stockholm Skavsta airport. A literature study coupled with a comparative analysis has also been done. Conclusions: Dramatic change is occurring in the industry. Competition is increasing not only between companies but between two competing business models. Increased competition is leading to better on-time performance but lower in-flight and ground service quality. Aggregate price level has risen for flag carries with the opposite happening for low-cost carriers. The increased competition is threatening the ill-performing flag carriers and will most likely transform the industry...|$|R
50|$|Directed by Krešimir Dolenčić, the {{ceremony}} started with an introduction of host cities. Zagreb was depicted {{as the city}} of universities, parks, museums, art and sporting success, while Rijeka was depicted as the city of naval tradition, torpedoes, rock and roll, good vibrations and the world’s second largest carnival. Croatian singer Damir Kedžo and the University of Zagreb’s choir Concordia discors performed the official song of the Games- As long as heart believes. The anthem describes the synergy of faith and hard work, which explains its popularity among the athletes {{who came to the}} Games. It is not easy to study and achieve good sporting results at the same time, and the very fact that they are participating makes all student athletes at the Games champions of hard work, faith, knowledge, and labor. A parade of this year’s participants ensued; the participants and the organizers of the 1987 Universiade carried the flag of the European University Sports Association, leading the parade- legendary basketball coach Mirko Novosel, the president of the Executive Board of the 1987 Universiade, lawyer Vladimir Pezo, the former Mayor of Zagreb, Dr. Mato Mikić, the director of the security sector of the 1987 Universiade, Lieutenant General Mate Laušić, the director of the opening ceremony of the 1987 Universiade, Paolo Magelli, and theatre director and producer Duško Ljuština, who was the director of the culture sector at the 1987 Universiade. The first group of <b>flag-carriers</b> then passed the flag to the second group, consisting of several Croatian trophy-winning athletes: longtime member of the Croatian national water polo team Dubravko Šimenc, basketball player Danira Bilić, backstroke swimmer Gordan Kožulj, basketball player and coach Aleksandar Petrović, tennis player Renata Šašak and water polo player Samir Barać. Over five thousand participants walked the athletic track at Mladost Stadium, entering the track in alphabetical order by the name of the country they came from. The hosts occasionally made interesting remarks about the 403 universities participating in the Games. The hosts walked at the tail of the parade - Croatian students came from 16 universities from Zagreb, Osijek, Karlovac, Rijeka, Split, Pula, Vukovar and Dubrovnik.
