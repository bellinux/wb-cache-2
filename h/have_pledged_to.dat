5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 <b>have</b> <b>pledged</b> <b>to</b> adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) <b>have</b> <b>pledged</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the amount of}} food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E

25|$|During the company’s growth stage, {{advertising}} messages {{moved from}} the engaging and customer oriented to less personal slogans and campaigns.

As the official airline of the New York Jets, JetBlue has specially painted the exterior {{of one of their}} Airbus A320s (N746JB) in the team's colors. Aircraft N605JB is based on the design of the Boston Red Sox road uniform and sports a grey fuselage with navy lettering.
