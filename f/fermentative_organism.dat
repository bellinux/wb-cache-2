40|$|Abstract Background Crude {{glycerol}} is {{the main}} byproduct of the biodiesel industry. Although it can have different applications, its purification is costly. Therefore, in this study a biotechnological route has been proposed for further utilization of crude glycerol in the fermentative production of lactic acid. This acid is largely utilized in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and chemical industries, making it the hydroxycarboxylic acid with the highest market potential worldwide. Currently, industrial production of lactic acid is done mainly using sugar as the substrate. Thus here, for the first time, Pichia pastoris has been engineered for heterologous l-lactic acid production using glycerol as a single carbon source. For that, the Bos taurus lactate dehydrogenase gene was introduced into P. pastoris. Moreover, a heterologous and a novel homologous lactate transporter have been evaluated for l-lactic acid production. Results Batch fermentation of the P. pastoris X- 33 strain producing LDHb allowed for lactic acid production in this yeast. Although P. pastoris {{is known for its}} respiratory metabolism, batch fermentations were performed with different oxygenation levels, indicating that lower oxygen availability increased lactic acid production by 20  %, pushing the yeast towards a fermentative metabolism. Furthermore, a newly putative lactate transporter from P. pastoris named PAS has been identified by search similarity with the lactate transporter from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Jen 1 p. Both heterologous and homologous transporters, Jen 1 p and PAS, were evaluated in one strain already containing LDH activity. Fed-batch experiments of P. pastoris strains carrying the lactate transporter were performed with the batch phase at aerobic conditions followed by an aerobic oxygen-limited phase where production of lactic acid was favored. The results showed that the strain containing PAS presented the highest lactic acid titer, reaching a yield of approximately 0. 7  g/g. Conclusions We showed that P. pastoris has a great potential as a <b>fermentative</b> <b>organism</b> for producing l-lactic acid using glycerol as the carbon source at limited oxygenation conditions (below 0. 05  % DO in the bioreactor).

That way, biomass concentration can be maintained, allowing a smooth restart of the WGS reaction with no lag time or the need to rebuild the bacterial population.

40|$|Industrial wastewaters can be {{purified}} in methanogenic bioreactors {{such as the}} upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor. In such reactors biomass {{is completely}} degraded to CH 4 and CO 2 , by several trophic groups of microorganisms. However, those gases are also responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect, and therefore the occurrence of methanogenic decomposition in natural habitats is much less appreciated. In the introduction (Chapter 1 ) of this thesis, one particular {{step in the process}} of methanogenic decomposition, propionate oxidation, is discussed. Propionate is one of the compounds which can only be oxidized syntrophically under methanogenic conditions, and the organisms responsible for this step are extremely interesting due to their ability to thrive at the lowest possible amounts of energy available. Syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria produce acetate, H 2 , CO 2 and formate. To make this reaction energetically feasible, methanogenic archaea must keep the concentrations of H 2 and formate extremely low. Two classes of enzymes which may be important for this 'Interspecies electron transfer', i. e. hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, and the present knowledge of these enzymes, is discussed in Chapter 1. Furthermore, this Chapter summarizes what is know about syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria so far. Most of the isolated propionate-oxidizing bacteria belong to the genus Syntrophobacter and cluster together with gram-negative sulfate reducing bacteria within thed-subdivision of the proteobacteria. Other syntrophic propionate oxidizers are more closely related to the genus Syntrophus, while recently two thermophilic organisms were described which are close relatives of low GC gram-positive Desulfotomaculum species. A related organism was also enriched from mesophilic sludge, and Chapter 2 of this thesis describes the isolation and physiological characterization of a defined co-culture of this organism with Methanospirillum hungatei. Remarkably this organism, which was named ' Pelotomaculum schinkii', harbors two different 16 S rDNA genes. This unusual property of sequence heterogeneities has also been reported for other gram-positive bacteria. However, compared to other syntrophic propionate oxidizers this organism is exceptional since it did not grow axenically on any of the substrates tested. For most syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria it is known that propionate is oxidized via the Methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway. Besides the ability to couple propionate oxidation to the sulfate reduction, these organisms are also able to ferment fumarate in pure culture. Although ' Pelotomaculum schinkii' most likely uses the methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway to oxidize propionate, none of the intermediates of this pathway supported growth in this organism. Therefore, this organism may be the first true obligate syntrophic anaerobic bacterium isolated. An organism, which does not use the methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway to oxidize propionate, is Smithella propionica. This organism produces small amounts of butyrate from propionate and it produces much less CH 4 than organisms, which are known to use the methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway. The occurrence of another pathway of propionate conversion was previously already demonstrated in methanogenic habitats and enrichment cultures. The randomizing methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway could not account for the products recovered from 13 C-labeled propionate in these studies. Therefore the pathway of propionate oxidation was studied with 13 C-NMR in Smithella propionica (Chapter 3 ). Experiments with 2, 3 - 13 C-labeled propionate revealed that half of the methyl-methylene bonds in propionate were broken during propionate conversion. Labeled bicarbonate was never recovered from cultures grown on labeled propionate, and experiments in which 13 C-bicarbonate was added showed that it was not incorporated either. These observations were inconsistent with pathways proposed previously to occur in methanogenic habitats, such as the acryloyl-CoA pathway and the reductive carboxylation pathway. In this Chapter, a novel pathway of propionate is proposed. The results of 13 C-NMR experiments suggested that the C 2 of propionate is coupled to the carboxyl-group of a second propionate molecule, followed by a rearrangement to a 6 -carbon unbranched intermediate. Cleavage of this molecule then yields acetate and butyrate, which is further oxidized syntrophically to acetate. Such pathway perfectly explained the ratios of labeled products recovered from experiments with 1 -, 2 -, 3 - and 2, 3 - 13 C-labeled propionate, and also fitted with the stoichiometry of propionate conversion. In batches to which 1 - and 2 - 13 C-labeled acetate was added together with unlabeled propionate, a small amount of label was recovered in propionate revealing that the proposed pathway should be reversible. For all other studies described in this thesis Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans was used as a model organism. Previous studies have revealed that this organism is able to produce both H 2 and formate during propionate oxidation, and it could only grow with methanogens that utilize both H 2 and formate. The enzymes responsible for proton and bicarbonate reduction are hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. The presence of both enzymes in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans was also demonstrated in previous studies. In Chapter 4 of this thesis several experiments are described which demonstrate that this organism possesses at least 2 distinct formate dehydrogenases and at least 3 distinct hydrogenases. All these enzymes were induced under all growth conditions tested, though there were some variations in the levels of each enzyme. One of the formate dehydrogenases may be involved in CO 2 -fixation by running the acetyl-CoA cleavage pathway in the reverse direction during growth on propionate. Most likely the other enzyme is involved in terminal reduction of CO 2 . The presence of multiple hydrogenases in sulfate-reducing bacteria is not unusual. For the genus Desulfovibrio a model has been described how these organism use three distinct hydrogenases to conserve energy. Such a H 2 -cycling mechanism may also be present in S. fumaroxidans. In a separate study (Chapter 5 ), the hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase levels of axenic S. fumaroxidans cells were compared to the levels in cells which were grown syntrophically. Since the methanogenic partner of syntrophic growth (Methanospirillum hungatei) also possesses these enzymes, the organisms needed to be separated from each other in order to analyze the levels in S. fumaroxidans. Percoll gradient centrifugation proved to be an excellent method to separate syntrophically grown cells. The S. fumaroxidans cells which were separated in this way exhibited very high formate dehydrogenase activities as compared to cells grown axenically. Also the M. hungatei cells which were grown syntrophically exhibited higher formate dehydrogenase activities as compared to cells grown axenically on H 2 or formate. The hydrogenase levels of these cells were comparable to the levels in axenic cultures. For S. fumaroxidans the hydrogenase levels in cells which were grown syntrophically were also higher than in cells which were grown axenically. Both enzymes seemed {{to play an important role}} in S. fumaroxidans during syntrophic growth, while the enzyme levels of M. hungatei suggested a more important role for formate dehydrogenase during syntrophic growth. One of the hydrogenase which could be involved in syntrophic growth was purified from S. fumaroxidans cells grown on fumarate (Chapter 6 ). The enzyme is a typical NiFe-hydrogenase though the levels of both H 2 -uptake and H 2 -evolution were relatively high compared to other described [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments predicted the presence of both [4 Fe- 4 S]-, and [3 Fe- 4 S] clusters. The hydrogenase encoding DNA region was amplified by using a combination of PCR and inverse PCR and primers based on the N-terminal sequence of the large subunit and a conserved region of NiFe-hydrogenases from other organisms. The sequence harbored binding motifs for two [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters and one [3 Fe- 4 S] cluster, and a twin-arginine motif in the precursor of the small subunit suggesting a periplasmic location of the enzyme. The protein sequences of both subunits of the enzyme showed highest similarity to the enzymes isolated from Desulfovibrio species. Previous studies revealed that in those organisms could catalyze the reduction of protons during syntrophic growth on lactate. Therefore, it is likely that the enzyme isolated from S. fumaroxidans is also used to reduce protons to H 2 during syntrophic growth on propionate. The two formate dehydrogenases of S. fumaroxidans were both isolated and appeared to be enzymes with very high specific activities, both in the direction of formate oxidation as well as in the direction of CO 2 -reduction (Chapter 7 ). Since a function as formate dehydrogenase was very unlikely during growth of this organism, a more appropriate name for these enzymes would be 'CO 2 -reductases'. Both enzymes could be isolated from fumarate grown cells, but also from cells grown syntrophically on propionate. EPR-experiments revealed the presence of [2 Fe- 2 S] clusters in FDH 1, while [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters were detected in both enzymes. The presence of tungsten could not be confirmed with EPR spectroscopy, but metal-analysis demonstrated that both these enzymes were tungsten-selenium proteins and that they did not contain molybdenum. From a comparison of these two enzymes with formate dehydrogenases isolated from other organisms, it was concluded that the few formate dehydrogenases described with a CO 2 -reducing function contain tungsten. Enzymes, which physiologically mainly oxidize formate, may contain either W or Mo, but preferably molybdenum since this compound is present at much higher concentrations in natural environments. It is hypothesized in this Chapter that the Mo-containing enzymes evolved from W-containing enzymes. In Chapter 8 a new hypothesis is proposed for the origin of the eukaryotic cell. The first eukaryote is proposed to have arisen in a methanogenic ecosystem. The host was a heterotrophic <b>fermentative</b> <b>organism,</b> which produced reduced organic compounds. Two endosymbionts were acquired via endocytosis, a acetogenic syntrophic bacterium, and its partner organism a methanogenic archaeon. All partners involved profited from the new situation, which explains the origin of both the nucleus and the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells. We believe that, among contemporary syntrophic bacteria, the most plausible candidate for a mitochondrial ancestor is a syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacterium. Finally, it can be concluded that syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria possess a unique metabolism and that they may have been involved in the crucial step of evolution. Clearly, these organisms deserve more attention in the future...|$|E

Bacteriol. 92 : 707 – 713. 1966. —The {{effect of}} environmental pantothenate levels {{on the growth}} of Streptococcus faecalis 9790 was studied in terms of growth rate, depletion phenomena, cellular coenzyme A (CoA) content, and differential rates of wall and membrane synthesis. Low concentrations of pantothenate yielded normal exponential growth curves up to peak turbidities which are a function of pantothenate concentration. Attainment of these peaks was followed by lysis. Under such conditions, bacterial CoA increased initially in proportion with cell substance, but attained a peak level much earlier than cell substance, and then gradually decreased down to vanishing amounts. With higher pantothenate concentrations, cellular CoA levels increased to a maximum, and, under these conditions, the CoA content remained constant during exponential growth. Four-fifths of the pantothenate requirement of growing cells was eliminated by environmental oleate and palmitate. When CoA disappeared during growth on low pantothenate levels, cell wall synthesis seemed to continue at nearly normal rates, but membrane synthesis was severely curtailed. The data suggest that in <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms</b> pantothenate action might be confined to wall and membrane synthesis, that these two processes differ in their quantitative dependence on pantothenate, and that pantothenate might occur {{in the form of}} acyl carrier protein as well as CoA...|$|R

These include inhibitory compounds produced by the pre-treatment processes required to release constituent carbohydrates from biomass feed-stocks and during fermentation, exposure of the organisms to stressful conditions. In addition, for lignocellulosic bioethanol production, conversion of both pentose and hexose sugars is a pre-requisite for <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms</b> for efficient and complete conversion. All these factors are important to maximise industrial efficiency, productivity and profit margins in order to make second-generation bioethanol an economically viable alternative to fossil fuels for future transport needs. Results: The aim of the current study was to assess Saccharomyces yeasts for their capacity to tolerate osmotic, temperature and ethanol stresses and inhibitors that might typically be released during steam explosion of wheat straw. Phenotypic microarray analysis was used to measure tolerance as a function of growth and metabolic activity. Saccharomyces strains analysed in this study displayed natural variation to each stress condition common in bioethanol fermentations. In addition, many strains displayed tolerance to more than one stress, such as inhibitor tolerance combined with fermentation stresses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that this study could identify a potential candidate strain or strains for efficient second generation bioethanol production. Knowledge of the Saccharomyces spp. strains grown in these conditions will aid the development of breeding programmes in order to generate more efficient strains for industrial fermentations.

40|$|Cellulosic biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} industrial waste products and an appealing substrate for biorefining strategies to produce biofuels by fermentation. The metabolic engineering of fermentative bacteria, such as the thermophile Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, for high bioethanol yield is well characterised. This has been traditionally facilitated by an economically inefficient multistep process referred to as separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), in which the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulosic substrate and fermentation of the liberated sugars is performed sequentially. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) involves performing these two process steps simultaneously, by either introducing cellulolytic capabilities into naturally <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms</b> or implementing <b>fermentative</b> capabilities in cellulolytic organisms through metabolic engineering. CBP is believed to be a potentially cost-efficient and commercially viable way to produce cellulosic biofuels since the feedback inhibition of glycosyl hydrolases by monosaccharides as they are released is reduced by their rapid conversion through microbial fermentation. This results in faster rates of production and higher yields than those possible with SHF. Furthermore, CBP offers energy savings by removing the need for a complex multistage process with multiple heating and cooling steps. The aim of the present project is the engineering of CBP capabilities in the ethanologen G. thermoglucosidasius through the heterologous secretion of active glycosyl hydrolases into the extracellular milieu or employing surface-layer homology domains to attach them to the bacterial cell-wall. Iterative optimisation will serve to evaluate the feasibility of CBP as a strategy for production of biofuels from lignocellulose using G. thermoglucosidasius...|$|R
40|$|Six {{bacterial}} genera containing species {{commonly used}} as probiotics {{for human consumption}} or starter cultures for food fermentation were compared and contrasted, based on publicly available complete genome sequences. The analysis included 19 Bifidobacterium genomes, 21 Lactobacillus genomes, 4 Lactococcus and 3 Leuconostoc genomes, {{as well as a}} selection of Enterococcus (11) and Streptococcus (23) genomes. The latter two genera included genomes from probiotic or commensal as well as pathogenic organisms to investigate if their non-pathogenic members shared more genes with the other probiotic genomes than their pathogenic members. The pan- and core genome of each genus was defined. Pairwise BLASTP genome comparison was performed within and between genera. It turned out that pathogenic Streptococcus and Enterococcus shared more gene families than did the non-pathogenic genomes. In silico multilocus sequence typing was carried out for all genomes per genus, and the variable gene content of genomes was compared within the genera. Informative BLAST Atlases were constructed to visualize genomic variation within genera. The clusters of orthologous groups (COG) classes of all genes in the pan- and core genome of each genus were compared. In addition, it was investigated whether pathogenic genomes contain different COG classes compared to the probiotic or <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms,</b> again comparing their pan- and core genomes. The obtained results were compared with published data from the literature. This study illustrates how over 80 genomes can be broadly compared using simple bioinformatic tools, leading to both confirmation of known information as well as novel observations...|$|R

The involvement of these syntrophic populations is essential for mineralization of chlorinated aromatic compounds under methanogenic conditions. The fermentative production of low levels of hydrogen (H 2) {{can also be used}} to selectively deliver a limiting electron donor to dehalogenating organisms and achieve complete dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic contaminants such as tetrachloroethene. Thus, tracking the abundance of syntrophically coupled populations should aid in the development and monitoring of sustainable bioremediation strategies. In this study, two complementary nucleic acid–based methods were used to identify and assess relative changes or differences in the abundance of potentially important populations in complex anaerobic microbial communities that mineralized chlorinated aromatic compounds. Population dynamics were related to the consumption and production of key metabolic substrates, intermediates, and products. Syntrophus-like populations were detected in 3 -chlorobenzoate–degrading communities derived from sediment or sludge digesters. In the presence of H 2 -consuming populations, characterized Syntrophus species ferment benzoate, a central intermediate in the anaerobic metabolism of 3 -chlorobenzoate and 2 -chlorophenol. A DNA probe that targeted characterized Syntrophus species was developed and used to quantify rRNA extracted from the 3 -chlorobenzoate – and 2 -chlorophenol–degrading communities. The level of rRNA targeted by the Syntrophus-specific probe tracked with the formation of benzoate during metabolism of the parent compounds. Hybridizations with an Archaea-specific probe and/or measurement of methane production demonstrated that methanogens directly benefited from the influx of benzoate-derived electron donors, and the activities of Syntrophus-like and methanogenic populations in the contaminant-degrading communities were closely linked...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: As {{the supply}} of starch grain and sugar cane, {{currently}} the main feedstocks for bioethanol production, become limited, lignocelluloses will be sought as alternative materials for bioethanol production. Production of cellulosic ethanol is still cost-inefficient because of the low final ethanol concentration {{and the addition of}} nutrients. We report the use of simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) of lignocellulosic residues from commercial furfural production (furfural residue, FR) and corn kernels to compare different nutritional media. The final ethanol concentration, yield, number of live yeast cells, and yeast-cell death ratio were investigated {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} integrating cellulosic and starch ethanol. Results: Both the ethanol yield and number of live yeast cells increased with increasing corn-kernel concentration, whereas the yeast-cell death ratio decreased in SSCF of FR and corn kernels. An ethanol concentration of 73. 1 g/L at 120 h, which corresponded to a 101. 1 % ethanol yield based on FR cellulose and corn starch, was obtained in SSCF of 7. 5 % FR and 14. 5 % corn kernels with mineral-salt medium. SSCF could simultaneously convert cellulose into ethanol from both corn kernels and FR, and SSCF ethanol yield was similar between the organic and mineralsalt media. Conclusions: Starch ethanol promotes cellulosic ethanol by providing important nutrients for <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms,</b> and in turn cellulosic ethanol promotes starch ethanol by providing cellulosic enzymes that convert the cellulosic polysaccharides in starch materials into additional ethanol. It is feasible to produce ethanol in SSCF of FR and corn kernels with mineral-salt medium. It would be cost-efficient to produce ethanol in SSCF of high concentrations of water-insoluble solids of lignocellulosic materials and corn kernels. Compared with prehydrolysis and fed-batch strategy using lignocellulosic materials, addition of starch hydrolysates to cellulosic ethanol production is a more suitable method to improve the final ethanol concentration...|$|R

In addition, {{there are numerous}} sites {{around the world that}} are contaminated with a mixture of organic and inorganic contaminants. In most sites, over time, water infiltrates the wastes, and releases metals, radionuclides and other contaminants causing transport into the surrounding environment. We investigated the role of fermentative microorganisms in such sites that may control metal, radionuclide and organics migration from source zones. The project was initiated based on the following overarching hypothesis: Metals, radionuclides and other contaminants can be mobilized by infiltration of water into waste storage sites. Microbial communities of lignocellulose degrading and fermenting microorganisms present in the subsurface of contaminated DOE sites can significantly impact migration by directly reducing and immobilizing metals and radionuclides while degrading complex organic matter to low molecular weight organic compounds. These low molecular weight organic acids and alcohols can increase metal and radionuclide mobility by chelation (i. e., certain organic acids) or decrease mobility by stimulating respiratory metal reducing microorganisms. We demonstrated that <b>fermentative</b> <b>organisms</b> capable of affecting the fate of Cr 6 +, U 6 + and trinitrotoluene can be isolated from organic-rich low level waste sites as well as from less organic rich subsurface environments.
