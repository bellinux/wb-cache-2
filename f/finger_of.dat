40|$|Swan neck {{deformity}} is a hyperextension of {{the proximal}} interphalangeal (PIP) joints and flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Claw hand is a hyperextension of the metacarpal joints and flexion of the PIP joints, accompanied by reduced motor strength. A 23 -year-old female, who {{was released from}} leprosy treatment, presented with a bend of the second to fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> both hands. There was hyperextension of the PIP joints and flexion of the DIP joints from the second to fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> both hands, thickening of the ulnar nerves, and hypoesthesia without motor impairment of {{the fourth and fifth}} <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> both hands. Radiograph examination revealed cupping of the base of the proximal phalangeal joints of the second, third, and fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the left hand and of the second and fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the right hand. Additionally, narrowing of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the second, third, and fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the right hand and sclerosis of the second and fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the right hand were also observed. Claw hand is frequently reported in leprosy, while swan neck deformity is frequently reported in rheumatoid arthritis.

5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
40|$|In most haptic search tasks, tactile stimuli are {{presented}} to the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> both hands. In such tasks, the search pattern for some object features, such as the shape of raised line symbols, {{has been found to}} be serial. The question is whether this search is serial over all <b>fingers</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the hand, or whether it is serial over the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> each hand and parallel over the two hands. To investigate this issue, we determined the speed of static haptic search when two items {{are presented}} to two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the same hand and when two items are presented to two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> different hands. We compared the results with predictions for parallel and serial search based on the results of a previous study using the same items and a similar task. The results indicate that two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the same hand process information in a serial manner, while two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> two different hands process information in parallel. Thus, considering the individual fingers as independent units in haptic search may not be justified, because the hand that they belong to matters. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E
5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|By 23March, Jourdan had his {{headquarters}} {{in the vicinity of}} Stockach. He had recalled Barthélemy Ferino from the far right flank; Ferino had retreated along the coast of the Überlingen Lake, the northwestern <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> Lake Constance, to be in position at the close right flank, adjacent to Souham's division. Lefebvre, wounded at Ostrach, was unable to take the field himself, and Laurent Saint Cyr commanded the left flank. When Jourdan considered his position, he felt it too extended, so he drew back further behind Stockach, toward Engen, where he could concentrate his force. The first division camped near the Hohentwiel, the 11th-century fortress overlooking the marshes at the westernmost point of the Lake Constance. The second division, the advanced guard, and a cavalry division were camped on the heights above Engen. The third division was camped by Leibtengen (Liptingen, the French called it), and Neuhausen. Vandamme and his small corps worked themselves discreetly into a position behind the Austrian right flank. Jourdan established {{his headquarters}} at Engen.|$|E
5|$|In a Victorian village, Victor Van Dort, {{the son of}} nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the {{neglected}} {{daughter of}} snobbish yet impoverished aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root.

5|$|The Arab states {{surrounding}} the Mandate of Palestine started to prepare themselves {{a few weeks}} before May 15. According to the Arab plan, the Syrian army was to attack the new state from southern Lebanon and capture Safed. As such, the Syrians massed their forces in that area; however, after they found out that Lebanon did not wish to actively participate in combat, their plans changed to an attack from the southern Golan Heights on Samakh (Tzemah) and later Tiberias. The Syrian force assembled in Qatana on May 1. It moved on May 12 to Beirut and to Sidon on May 13, after which it headed to Bint Jbeil. After the sudden plan change, the force moved to Nabatieh, and proceeded around the <b>Finger</b> <b>of</b> the Galilee to Banias and Quneitra, from which the eventual attack was staged.|$|E
5|$|The {{hands and}} forearms of Triceratops {{retained}} a fairly primitive structure {{compared to other}} quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward ("pronated") as the animals walked. Triceratops, like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods, walked with most of their fingers pointing out {{and away from the}} body, the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods. In Triceratops, the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers of the hand, while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the innermost <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc.|$|E

5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E
