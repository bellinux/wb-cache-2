5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E

25|$|At {{a meeting}} of Indians called for a {{condemnation}} of Dhingra's deed, Savarkar protested the intention to condemn and was drawn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> debate and angry scuffle with other participants. A secretive and restricted trial and a sentence awarding the death penalty to Dhingra provoked an outcry and protest across the Indian student and political community. Strongly protesting the verdict, Savarkar struggled with British authorities in laying claim to Dhingra's remains following his execution. Savarkar hailed Dhingra as a hero and martyr, and began encouraging revolution with greater intensity.|$|E

He also perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot,</b> life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect. Sagan and his Cornell colleague Edwin Ernest Salpeter speculated about life in Jupiter's clouds, given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded {{that they were not}} seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms.|$|E

500|$|After {{defeating}} another slime-covered Piranha Plant and {{a sunken}} statue {{rises from the}} ground, they see Shadow Mario {{on top of the}} statue for the first time. He jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down by spraying him with water from FLUDD. Shadow Mario immediately creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and a hill, some trees and a section of wall rise up from the ground. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach once again, towards Pinna Island, home of Isle Delfino's theme park. There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario (titled Mecha Bowser) by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster, while also shooting down the Bullet Bills that Mecha Bowser fires. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser who wields a magic brush that creates graffiti which, like FLUDD, was also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr. turns the remains of Mecha Bowser <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach, having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario beats Bowser Jr. in all nine areas (not including the Delfino airstrip), a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. While most levels are restricted by this flood, the flood disappears after the player has entered Corona Mountain. Mario enters the volcano, and after getting through the volcano's inner cave, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in using the Rocket Nozzle and super ground pound, rescuing the princess. Mario and the princess fall from the sky while [...] Bowser and Bowser Jr. are falling onto platforms in the ocean. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach opens her parasol, and lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the landing, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Princess Peach and the others resume their vacation. Meanwhile, Bowser admits to his son that Princess Peach was not really his mother—but Bowser Jr. responds that he already knows and {{that he would like to}} battle Mario again when he is older, making his father proud.|$|E
2500|$|In the Propane Gallery, {{the most}} {{prominent}} display is an interactive hot air balloon simulation. [...] Visitors are able to step <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> air balloon basket to not only learn about how propane fuels this device but also {{get a sense of}} an actual hot air balloon ride. Glenn Koehler, NMIH's marketing and outreach coordinator believes that the Propane Gallery is the most popular interactive exhibit. Mechanical and digital characteristics such as moving floor boards and aerial video give the viewers a very well rounded, realistic approach to a hot air balloon ride. The educational purpose of this display is to express the widespread use of propane gas.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of PTC {{thermistor}} is {{the polymer}} PTC, which is sold under brand {{names such as}} [...] "Polyswitch" [...] "Semifuse", and [...] "Multifuse". [...] This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. [...] When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. [...] When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing {{the resistance of the}} device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. [...] Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. [...] Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. [...] PTC thermistors 'latch' <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled. [...] In fact, Neil A Downie showed how you can use the effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa.|$|E

It also shows huge mass loss of atmospheric material, suggesting that it may further evolve <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hotter</b> supergiant. Westerlund 1-26 has been observed to change its spectral class during several periods, but it has not been seen to change its luminosity.|$|R
2500|$|The Indian subcontinent (encompassing India, Pakistan {{and other}} {{countries}} of South Asia) has a long jewellery history, which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000–8,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years. One {{of the first to}} start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley Civilization (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic bangles. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the bead trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age. [...] Persian style also played a big role in India’s jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.|$|E
