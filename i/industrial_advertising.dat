40|$|For {{decades the}} {{prevailing}} idea in B 2 B marketing {{has been that}} buyers are motivated by product/service specifications. Sellers are put on approved supplier lists, invited to respond to RFPs, and are {{selected on the basis}} of superior products, at the right price, delivered on time. The history of B 2 B advertising is filled with the advice “provide product specifications” and your advertising will be noticed, lead to sales inquiries, and eventually result in higher sales. Advertising filled with abstractions might work in the B 2 C market, but the B 2 B marketplace is about being literal. What we know about advertising — and particularly the message component of advertising — is based on a combination of experience, unproven ideas and a bit of social science. Over the years, advertising guidelines produced by the predecessors of BMA (National <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advertising</b> Association, Association of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advertising,</b> and the Business/Professional Advertising Association) stressed emphasizing product features and tangible benefits. The major publishers of B 2 B magazines, e. g., McGraw-Hill, Penton Publishing, et al. had similar recommendations. Also, B 2 B marketing books recommend advertising that focuses on specific product features (Kotler and Pfoertsch, 2006; Lamons, 2005). In more recent times, abstraction in advertising messages has penetrated the B 2 B marketplace. Even though such advertising legends as David Ogilvy (1963, 1985) frequently recommended advertising based on hard-core information, we’ve seen the growing use of emotional appeals, including humor, fear, parental affection, etc. Beyond the use of emotion, marketers attempt to build a stronger connection between their brands and buyers through the use of abstraction and symbolism. Below are two examples of B 2 B advertisements — Figure 1 A is high in literalism and Figure 1 B is high in symbolism. Which approach — a “left-brain” (literal) or “right brain” (symbolic) is more effective in B 2 B advertising? Are the advertising message creation guidelines from the history of B 2 B advertising accurate? Are the foundations of B 2 B message creation (experience and unproven ideas) sound...|$|E

5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the <b>industrial</b> revolution that <b>advertising</b> boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The <b>industrial</b> revolution changed <b>advertising</b> from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|R
