40|$|Abstract: The {{main reasons}} for the issuing of Section 54 notices under the Mine <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Safety</b> Act, 29 of 1996 (MHSA) is the failure of mining {{operations}} {{to comply with the}} Act. When <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> standards <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> have not been properly implemented and do not comply with the MHSA, a Section 54 notice is likely to be issued by the Inspector of Mines from the Department of Mineral Resource (DMR). Section 54 of the MHSA states that ’If an inspector has reason to believe that any occurrence, practice or condition at a mine endangers or may endanger the health or safety of any person at the mine, the inspector may give any instruction necessary to protect the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> of persons at the mine’. Section 30 of the Occupational <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Safety</b> Act, 85 of 1993 (OHSA) also grants an inspector powers to deal with dangerous conditions. A number of statements and reports have been published about the impacts of Section 54 on the mining business, but very little (if any) information is available on the impact on mineworkers’ morale. In 2011, Section 54 stoppages cost the South African economy $ 500 million by losing 300 000 precious metal ounces of production (Mining Weekly, 2012).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to investigate the}} attitudes of attendees with regard to the policies and procedures of health and safety at T in the Park 2015. Due to the importance of health and safety within festivals, it offers an interesting frontier for investigation as event managers can use the information found on the attitudes for the future planning of <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>procedures.</b> This dissertation critically examines the existing literature surrounding health and safety, the general attitudes of attendees and the risk factors at festivals. A gap in the literature was found, as there was no information on the attitudes towards health and safety at festivals. The research aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the challenges surrounding the health and safety of attendees at festivals. The research objectives like exploring the current <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>procedures,</b> investigating the attitudes of attendees at T in the Park and identifying if there are any influencing factors towards the attendees’ attitude will help achieve the research aim. It was predicted the best results would be achieved by taking a mixed method approach as more detail and expressive responses would be gathered. Data was first collected through the use of an interview with someone who worked security at T in the Park 2015. The information gathered from the interview was then used to construct the survey, where 75 people gave their thoughts about the health and safety at T in the Park. The study revealed that the way in which festivalgoers acknowledge health and safety is largely dependant upon their attitude, their reason for being at the festival and above everything else alcohol consumption. The attendees are aware of the threats towards their health and safety at the festival but still drink large amounts of alcohol. The data also showed that the majority of attendees surveyed thought their attitude changed towards health and safety when drinking alcohol. Despite this, the study also found that many of the festivalgoer’s wont change their alcohol drinking habits, as it is part of the enjoyment of the festival. Many respondent’s also suggested that they would go elsewhere if bringing your own alcohol were to be banned from the T in the Park campsite.

40|$|Printed {{proceedings}} of abstractsDisasters can generate {{large volumes of}} waste and debris (EPA 2008). In some cases, many years worth of waste can be generated in a single event – often overwhelming local solid waste management facilities and personnel, refer Figure 1. The availability and suitability of disposal sites can affect the efficiency of a disaster waste management programme and overall disaster recovery effort. Disaster waste impacts {{almost every aspect of}} an emergency response and recovery effort. Debris can impede rescuers and emergency services reaching survivors; inhibit provision of lifeline support; pose a public <b>and</b> environmental <b>health</b> hazard; <b>and</b> hinder the social and economic recovery of the affected area (Johnston, Dolan et al. 2009). Poor management of a clean-up effort can exacerbate these problems, and can result in a slow and costly recovery which is potentially risky to public <b>and</b> environmental <b>health</b> in both the short and long term. Landfills {{are an integral part of}} any disaster waste management strategy. Landfills are an efficient and, if constructed and operated appropriately, effective means of managing disaster waste. However, available airspace in existing landfills is often limited so disaster waste managers must consider 1) expanding existing facilities (in terms of size and waste acceptance) (Luther 2008), 2) constructing new facilities, or 3) reducing waste to landfill by recycling and reuse. Landfill operators may also change <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> management <b>procedures</b> to facilitate faster management of the waste. All these options has social, environmental and economic impacts, and their consideration is an integral part of both the emergency response/recovery and solid waste management systems. Figure 2 shows the conceptual framework used by the New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management for all recovery works of which debris will be managed within. So what are the decisions facing landfill and disaster waste managers? What is the best way to manage a landfill in a disaster situation? Is it appropriate to reduce environmental <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> standards to increase landfill capacity? How do you appropriately site a new landfill without time to assess the environmental impact? What are the acceptable risks in a disaster situation and who carries the liability (Luther 2008) ? In the poster the challenge of landfill and disaster waste managers will be introduced. An overview of the social, environmental and economic issues facing landfill managers is presented and we ask the question - if you were in charge – what would you do...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years low-toxicity “green” {{storable}} liquid propellants have become considerably more attractive as possible substitutes for nitrogen oxides and hydrazines. The main advantage of “green” propellants {{is represented by the}} significant cost savings associated with the drastic simplification of the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> protection <b>procedures</b> necessary during propellant production, storage and handling. Fuel Vapor Pressurization (FVP) technology of “green” bipropellant rocket engines potentially offers very significant additional advantages in terms of system cost, complexity, reliability, <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> mass, with practically no penalty in propulsive performance compared to traditional storable propellants such as mixed nitrogen oxides and hydrazines. Pioneering FVP experiments were carried out by Goddard, Wyld and others. Detailed studies have been conducted and several tests have been successfully performed since 1994 in the US, but no such experience is presently available in Europe, nor FVP has ever attained flight readiness anywhere in the world. The main characteristics of the FVP system examined in this work consist in the use of storable, non-toxic, inexpensive, non hypergolic, high-energy propellants such as hydrogen peroxide (HP, H 2 O 2) and ethane (C 2 H 6) and in the storage of these propellants in a single lightweight tank, using a flexible diaphragm or a bladder to separate the fuel from the oxidizer and a catalytic reactor to decompose the hydrogen peroxide before mixing and combustion with ethane. This configuration therefore yields a very simple and yet highly efficient and reliable propulsion system by eliminating the cost, the weight and complexity of propellant tanks and pressurization bottles, pressure and flow regulators and ignition systems. These advantages are of special relevance in low- or mediumthrust rocket engines for the rapidly expanding market of “small” space missions and led the authors to focus on the analysis and assessment of propulsion systems operating according to this concept. The present paper reports therefore the preliminary evaluation of fuel vapor pressurized H 2 O 2 -C 2 H 6 rocket propulsion systems. The results of the analysis confirm that the development of FVP technology may represent a significant contribution to the containment of the propulsion cost of small- and medium-size spacecrafts...|$|R
40|$|Objective: International {{travel to}} {{underdeveloped}} areas where both hygienic conditions and sufficient medical care {{are often in}} short supply can pose severe health risks. Infectious disease {{is one of the}} most common health risks for military forces deployed overseas. Careful personal hygiene and early symptom recognition serve as important steps in averting potential illness. With the ubiquitous deployment threat of chemical and biological warfare agents, the benefit of early detection and action can ultimately be critical for survival. Nowadays game-based learning models, made available on mobile devices in the form of apps, can provide relevant medical knowledge, and they can effectively reach a young military population. The aims of this preliminary research project are twofold: (1) We want to investigate whether young U. S. Army personnel would be open to the use of mobile apps while deployed abroad, and (2) we want to share the research design adopted with the intent of providing a baseline methodology that can be used in future larger studies. Subjects and Methods: We recruited and interviewed Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets at a university in the United States. Focus groups have been adopted as a research tool for collecting data. Open and close-ended questions were used during the focus group. Four domains were investigated: Cell phone usage, game console perceptions, game genre preferences, and gaming habits and perceptions. Results: The analysis of the focus group data reported that young military personnel often play with videogames and that they prefer first person Action/Combat genre. The data also showed that they do not consider playing videogames to be a leisure activity but a part of their lives. Conclusion: The preliminary results of this study suggest that games on cell phones could be considered as a platform for teaching young military personnel medical-related concepts <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>safety</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
