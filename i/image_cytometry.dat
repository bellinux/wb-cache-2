Hypodiploidy was detected by computed <b>image</b> <b>cytometry</b> in seven cases in which flow cytometry had shown only an aneuploid peak.

Therefore, we have compared the textural features observed in G 0 /G 1 nuclei from human leukemic CEM cells and their MDR variant CEM‐VLB, after staining of either DNA by Feulgen method or nuclear matrix by immunodetection of NuMA antigen on DNase treated samples. Chromatin or NuMA distributions within the nucleus were evaluated by <b>image</b> <b>cytometry.</b> Changes in textural parameters indicate that modifications of NuMA distribution observed in MDR cells are parallel to those observed at the whole chromatin level (i. e., a more decondensed and coarse texture with increase of Energy and Long‐run sections and decrease of Contrast and Short‐run sections).

In vitro, Trim 58 directly binds and ubiquitinates the intermediate chain of the microtubule motor dynein. In cells, Trim 58 stimulates proteasome-dependent degradation of the dynein holoprotein complex. During erythropoiesis, Trim 58 expression, dynein loss, and enucleation occur concomitantly, and all are inhibited by Trim 58 shRNAs. Dynein regulates nuclear positioning and microtubule organization, both of which undergo dramatic changes during erythroblast enucleation.

The present retrospective study comprised 26 surgical specimens of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in patients who underwent surgery alone at the Department of Surgery in CHUV Hospital in Lausanne, between January 1992 and December 1999. We analyzed 53 healthy tissues, 43 tumors, and six lymph node metastases. Diploid DNA histogram patterns were observed in all non-pathologic tissues analyzed, either distant or proximal to the lesion. Aneuploidy was observed in 30 (70 %) of 43 lesions; 20 (62. 5 %) of 32 early squamous-cell carcinomas; and 10 (91 %) of 11 advanced carcinomas. In patients with various tumor stages or with multicentric synchronous or metachronous tumors, DNA content was not different among different tumor stages.

40|$|Background: Virtual {{microscopy}} and {{automated processing}} of cytological slides are more challenging compared to histological slides. Since cytological slides exhibit a three-dimensional {{surface and the}} required microscope objectives with high resolution have a low depth of field, these cannot capture all objects of a single field of view in focus. One solution would be to scan multiple focal planes; however, the increase in processing time and storage requirements are often prohibitive for clinical routine. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we show {{that it is a}} reasonable trade-off to scan a single focal plane and automatically reject defocused objects from the analysis. To this end, we have developed machine learning solutions for the automated identification of defocused objects. Our approach includes creating novel features, systematically optimizing their parameters, selecting adequate classifier algorithms, and identifying the correct decision boundary between focused and defocused objects.

STUDY DESIGN: An extensive literature search was performed, and multiple markers were evaluated. The markers with the greatest potential for use as an adjunct to cytology were reviewed to {{determine the}} value of clinical implementation. Markers with a paucity of clinical research and poor results in clinical trials were omitted from review, as were genetic and cytologic prognostic determinants.

40|$|Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), {{a member}} of the {{glycosaminoglycan}} (GAG) family, was a contaminant in heparin that was linked to the 2008 heparin adverse events in the US.

The specificity and sensitivity of {{detection of}} low-grade bladder tumors can be further improved by quantitative fluorescence image analysis using antibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens. The chance of subsequent tumor following initial complete resection is significantly lowered compared to resection alone by either intravesical adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy. BCG is superior to chemotherapy in patients with high risk for recurrence, adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy does not prevent progression to > T 1 when compared with resection alone, BCG may delay progression {{and the need for}} cystectomy in high-risk patients (T 1, Cis or Cis associated with papillary Ta/T 1, > 3 recurrences/year, grade 3 tumors). Oral medication with bropirimine (an interferon inducer) induced complete response in patients with carcinoma in situ, oral Lactobacillus casei prolonged the recurrence-free interval to 1. 8 times that in the control group. New compounds for adjuvant treatment of superficial bladder tumors are best first tested on their ablative effects (marker lesion, Cis) prior to be used for prophylaxi...|$|R
