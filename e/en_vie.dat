40|$|Based on a choreographed lecture-performance {{that was}} {{originally}} given in French: "Langues vivantes en vie: rejeux vocaux et gestuels de l'expérience ". Performed by Jean Magnard, Mélissa Blanc and Jean-Rémi Lapaire. XXIème congrès de RANACLES (Réseau National des Centres de Langues de L'Enseignement Supérieur), Université Victor Ségalen-Bordeaux 2, 30. 11. 2013. International audienceUnlike English, Romance languages routinely refer to “foreign” or “modern” languages as “living” languages: langes vivantes (French), lingue vive (Italian), lenguas vivas (Spanish), llengües vives (Catalan), línguas vivas (Portuguese), limbi vii (Romanian). Dutch and German speakers occasionally use similar phrases emphasizing the “living” quality of language: levende talen, lebende Sprachen. The title {{chosen for the}} original lecture-performance 186 was a pun on the “life” or “vitality” of language 187 : Langues vivantes <b>en</b> <b>vie</b> (lit. “Living languages are alive / have a life”). The underlying logic was the following: language, whether spoken or written, is rooted in bodily motion. Movement {{is a sign of}} life. Language relies on movement. Language is life. The present English version contains video captures from the original French lecture-performance. The script was written and translated by myself. The performance was choreographed by Jean Magnard, assisted by Mélissa Blanc. All the illustrations given during the performance are taken from a corpus of authentic co-speech gestures made by native English speakers during interviews: talk show hosts, writers, film actors, and linguists...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Freshwater mollusks figure {{prominently}} in the diets of humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschian) and broad whitefish (C. nasus), two benthic-feeding coregonid species. A recent examination of pea clams (Sphaeriidae), valve snails (Valvatidae), and pond snails (Lymnaeidae) from the lower digestive tracts of these fish found {{that many of the}} mollusks were alive. Survival completely through gut passage would indicate a dispersal mechanism for freshwater mollusks that has not been previously recognized. A field investigation was conducted with wild-caught humpback and broad whitefish to test the hypothesis that clams and snails are capable of surviving complete gut passage. Wild fish were captured alive and held in collection totes to obtain feces samples. Pea clams and valve snails were abundant in fish feces, and pond snails were present but not abundant. An average of 483 pea clams and 833 valve snails per fish were observed to have survived complete gut passage, while only a single surviving pond snail was found. These findings suggest that fish may {{play an important role in}} the dispersal of freshwater mollusks within freshwater systems. Key words: Sphaeriidae, clams, Valvatidae, Lymnaeidae, snails, coregonid fish, gut passage RÉSUMÉ. Les mollusques d’eau douce constituent une partie imposante du régime alimentaire du corégone à bosse (Coregonus pidschian) et du corégone tschir (C. nasus), deux corégonidés à alimentation benthique. L’analyse récente de pisidies (Sphaeriidae), de valvatidés (Valvatidae) et de lymnéidés (Lymnaeidae) provenant du tractus digestif inférieur de ces poissons a permis de constater que grand nombre de ces mollusques étaient toujours <b>en</b> <b>vie.</b> Le fait d’avoir entièrement survécu dans l...|$|E
40|$|International audience"She {{smelled like}} death. Her husband instinctively retreated from her, like a worm, born from {{the tomb of}} Italy: she was the {{daughter}} of a father so spoiled by the great malady of the age that the mother gained her, Died {{at the same time as}} he did at the end of a year of marriage. "The girl herself was she alive ? " These words of Michelet tell how death, from the cradle to the grave, radiates the life of Catherine de 'Medici, the engine of her own history and of the history she is going through. The death of Catherine de 'Medici is first, in a genitive sense, the macabre as the property of Catherine de' Medici. Death is its own, something that belongs to it, as a fatality from which it can not get rid. From the wars of Italy to the wars of Religion, from the death of her husband to that of her children, death imposes itself as the central actor of his biography. This article analyzes the objects, mechanisms and stakes of this centrality of death in Catherine de Medicis' life. « On y sentait la mort; son mari instinctivement s’en reculait, comme d’un ver, né du tombeau de l’Italie. Elle était fille d’un père tellement gâté par la grande maladie du siècle que la mère la gagna, mourut en même temps que lui au bout d’un an de mariage. La fille elle-même était-elle <b>en</b> <b>vie</b> ». Ces mots de Michelet disent combien, du berceau au tombeau, la mort irradie la vie de Catherine de Médicis, moteur de sa propre histoire et de l’Histoire qu’elle traverse. La mort de Catherine de Médicis, c’est d’abord, en un sens génitif, le macabre comme propriété de Catherine de Médicis. La mort est son propre, quelque chose qui lui appartient, comme une fatalité dont elle ne peut se défaire. Des guerres d’Italie aux guerres de Religion, du décès de son mari à celui de ses enfants, la mort s’impose comme l’acteur central de sa biographie. Cet article analyse les objets, les mécanismes et les enjeux de cette centralité de la mort chez Catherine de Médicis...|$|E

50|$|In 1996, {{after more}} years of losses, Algo sold the company for $2.4 million to {{entrepreneur}} François Roberge, who had previous experience working in the industry. Roberge financed the sale primarily from loans and personal savings, and secured 23 of the company's 26 stores—which were at the time losing {{a million dollars a}} year. On acquirement, the company's head office, located in Toronto, employed only 12 people and Roberge made the choice to relocate the head office from Toronto to downtown Montreal. The first year under new ownership proved profitable and shortly after La <b>Vie</b> <b>en</b> Rose started opening stores annually. There are currently 150 stores throughout Canada, which employ around 2,000 people nationwide, including three concept stores: La <b>Vie</b> <b>en</b> Rose, La <b>Vie</b> <b>en</b> Rose Aqua, and La <b>Vie</b> <b>en</b> Rose Outlet. As of September 2011, the chain now counts 150 boutiques nationwide. The company brings in $130 million in domestic sales from its Canadian stores, as well as $10 million from 56 international locations. At the beginning of December 2011, the company acquired 11 stores from Ainsi Soit-Elle, a Quebec lingerie retailer. The stores are set to be reopened by the end of January 2012.|$|R
