Other possibilities include head trauma, stroke or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by genetic defects or brain tumors. Convulsions can also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by any type-1 diabetic, whose blood sugar is too low. Hypoglycemia can cause very bad convulsions until the person's blood sugar is raised to normal level. Convulsions can also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).|$|R
5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. This color change <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> {{by a small}} loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800°C, x = 0.00007.|$|E

5|$|Decimetric radio {{emission}} (with wavelengths measured in centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.

5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by the filling of the valence {{shell of the}} atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.|$|E

5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including hives, swelling, and headache. The reaction <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by {{inadequate}} {{function of}} the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.|$|E

40|$|Bomb blast cause injury {{on large}} groups of people by {{multiple}} mechanisms. Bomb blast injuries differ from the conventional description of trauma complexity. Primary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by blast wave and over pressure. Secondary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by flyin g debris and cause shrapnel wounds. Tertiary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by blast wind due to forceful impact and quaternary injuries <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by other vectors like heat, radiation etc. Combined injuries, especially blast and burn injury or blast and crush injur y, are common during an explosive event.
