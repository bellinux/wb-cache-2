5|$|Adhyatma Ramayana tells that Kabandha was {{a fierce}} cannibal {{and his arms}} were eight miles long. <b>His</b> <b>huge</b> face – which had no eyes or ears – was at his chest. He had no head or legs.|$|E
5|$|After Lord died in 2002, he bequeathed to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> {{collection}} of manuscripts, original letters and Titanic memorabilia, {{which he had}} gathered during his life and used to write A Night to Remember. MacQuitty also donated items from his own {{collection of}} material related to the film. Items from the collection are {{on display at the}} museum and can be accessed by researchers.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the true}} events, {{military}} historian David A. Graff opines that logistical concerns played the {{major role in}} Dou's decision to stay at Banzhu, as <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> army was utterly dependent on proximity to the Yellow River and its canal network for its supplies. In addition, the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army, containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated {{over the past few}} years, and whose loyalty was doubtful, prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions.|$|E

60|$|Then, at once, we all saw old Sultan {{close at}} hand. He was of immense size; his color was almost gray; <b>his</b> head <b>huge,</b> <b>his</b> paws heavy and round. He did not spit, nor snarl, nor growl; {{he did not}} look at the hounds, but kept his half-shut eyes upon us.|$|R

5|$|As one on an {{official}} mission, Wright {{would probably have}} offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqués de Lede, and to Alonso de Cárdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de Cárdenas {{a few weeks later}} – as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated – so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure – and that of <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> art collection – from Brussels in the autumn of 1655.|$|E
5|$|Thomas's fleet {{arrived at}} the capital first. Facing no {{opposition}} from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the mouths of the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army. Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had his young son Theophilos lead a procession along the walls, carrying {{a piece of the}} True Cross and the mantle of the Virgin Mary, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae, in full view of both armies.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E

5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Basildon, Morrison owned several estates, including Fonthill and Islay. The mansions provided a setting for <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> art collection, which included works by Constable, Turner and many Italian and Dutch old masters.

25|$|In the post-Soviet era Yevtushenko {{actively}} discussed environmental issues, confronted Russian Nationalist writers {{from the}} alternative Union of the Writers of Russia, and campaigned {{for the preservation}} of the memory of victims of Stalin's Gulag.

25|$|Although Cooke's bond campaigns {{were widely}} praised as a {{patriotic}} {{contribution to the}} Union cause, <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> personal financial gains did not go unnoticed. Notorious for stalling the deposit of bond proceeds into federal coffers, {{he was accused of}} corruption, and on December 22, 1862, Representative Charles A. Train proposed a Congressional investigation of the Treasury—though the investigation was never realized.|$|E
25|$|Nottingham Forest honoured him by {{renaming}} the City Ground's largest stand, the Executive Stand, the Brian Clough Stand. Clough {{was made}} an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 {{in recognition of}} <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> impact as a manager. In 1993, {{he was awarded the}} freedom of the city of Nottingham. In 2003, the city of Derby followed suit. He wrote a column for Four Four Two magazine up until his death.|$|E
25|$|His {{earliest}} documented work is <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> (1.345 x 2.818 metres, {{from six}} blocks) and impressive woodcut aerial view Map of Venice, {{for which a}} privilege was granted to its publisher in 1500, recording that the work had taken three years. This clearly drew {{on the work of}} many surveyors, but was a spectacular feat nonetheless, and caused a considerable stir from the first. It was later updated by others to reflect major new building projects in a second state of the print.|$|E
50|$|He sang {{extensively}} in Italy in 1795, and across France in 1795 to 1797, {{then returned to}} Paris, appearing at the newly renamed Opéra-Comique. He retired in 1813, after Napoléon I refused to increase <b>his</b> already <b>huge</b> salary.|$|R

25|$|His {{continued}} unpaid {{promotion of}} Eastern Air Lines {{earned him the}} undying gratitude of good friend Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who {{was the president of}} the airline. He was such a good friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring Douglas DC-3, fitted it out with an executive interior and DC-4 engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> Leesburg, Virginia, farm every Sunday night.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian land potentate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, who {{embarked}} {{on the defense}} of <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> threatened latifundium and its people, began retreating {{at the end of}} May from left-bank Ukraine. Fighting the Cossacks with some measure of success he matched the ruthlessness of the rebels, but brought no resolution to the conflict and prevented a possibility of the considered negotiated solution. Wiśniowiecki commanded his army at the Battle of Starokostiantyniv in late July against Cossack forces led by Maksym Kryvonis; its indecisive outcome allowed Wiśniowiecki and his units to continue their westward movement.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, he was President of the {{successful}} 7th International Malacological Congress in Amsterdam (1977), organized on behalf of Unitas Malacologica, the international organisation of malacologists. From 1989–1999, Dolf {{was chairman of the}} Netherlands Commission for International Nature Conservation, also serving as editor of its communications. Furthermore, he devoted energy to the Netherlands Zoological Society, the (former) Netherlands Foundation for Biological Research and the Dutch/Belgian Mammal Society. His interest in zoos is also demonstrated by <b>his</b> <b>huge</b> collection of zoo guides, for which he built a network of contacts all over the world.|$|E
