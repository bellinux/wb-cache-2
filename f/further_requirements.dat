25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the British Army became highly {{interested}} in the potential use of compact helicopters in the observation and aerial observation roles. In 1953, there was a requirement issued by the British Ministry of Supply which sought for a low-cost two-seat helicopter, which would be suitable for reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and training duties. This specification {{was considered to be}} quite demanding, calling for it to be capable of high speeds and quick climb rates even under tropical conditions. The rotorcraft was also required to be transportable {{on the back of a}} standard Army three-ton truck, constricting the dimensions of the prospective vehicle considerably. <b>Further</b> <b>requirements</b> for the prospective light helicopter included a flight endurance of one hour along with the potential for carrying light cargos such as fuel and tools as well as stretcher-bound wounded troops.

2500|$|The B5N carrier torpedo-bomber's {{weaknesses}} {{had shown}} themselves {{early in the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and, as well as updating that aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy began seeking a faster longer-ranged replacement. In December 1939 it issued a specification to Nakajima for a Navy Experimental 14-Shi Carrier Attack Aircraft capable of carrying the same external weapons load as the B5N. The new plane was to carry a crew of three (pilot, navigator/bombardier and radio operator/gunner) and be of low wing, cantilevered, all-metal construction (though control surfaces were fabric-covered). <b>Further</b> <b>requirements</b> included {{a top speed of}} , a cruising speed of [...] and a range of [...] with an [...] bomb load or [...] without external armament.|$|E

2500|$|The DH.98 was too radical for the Ministry, which {{wanted a}} heavily armed, {{multi-role}} aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and general purpose roles, {{as well as}} capable of carrying torpedoes. [...] With outbreak of war, the Ministry became more receptive, but still sceptical about an unarmed bomber. It thought the Germans would produce fighters faster than expected. It suggested two forward and two rear-firing machine guns for defence. The Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting {{at least a third}} crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights. The Air Council added <b>further</b> <b>requirements,</b> such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of [...] at [...] on two-thirds engine power, and a range of [...] with a [...] bomb load. To appease the Ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{essential}} {{principles of}} English contract law, however, remained stable and familiar, as an offer for certain terms, mirrored by an acceptance, supported by consideration, and free from duress, undue influence or misrepresentation, would generally be enforceable. The rules were codified and exported across the British Empire, as {{for example in}} the Indian Contract Act 1872. <b>Further</b> <b>requirements</b> of fairness in exchanges between unequal parties, or general obligations of good faith and disclosure {{were said to be}} unwarranted because it was urged by the courts that liabilities [...] "are not to be forced upon people behind their backs". Parliamentary legislation, outside general codifications of commercial law like the Sale of Goods Act 1893, similarly left people to the harsh realities of the market and [...] "freedom of contract". This only changed when the property qualifications to vote for members of parliament were reduced and eliminated, as the United Kingdom slowly became more democratic.|$|E

Destroyers had been requested as convoy escorts by General Blamey, Commander, Allied Land Forces, but rejected by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender commanding Allied Naval Forces noting the entire area between Cape Nelson and Buna was so filled with reefs that destroyers would be limited in maneuver and not effective against Japanese forces with clear sea room from bases in Rabaul. <b>Further,</b> <b>requirements</b> preliminary to the Guadalcanal operation required fleet units be on standby south of New Guinea. Thus the convoys would only have small, shallow draft warships for escort. A part of the Buna-Gona general plan was development of a deep water port in Oro Bay with a road to be constructed to an airfield to be developed for logistics and as a bomber base at Dobodura.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to provide the}} new Italian Republic with an emblem {{was taken by the}} government of Alcide De Gasperi in October 1946. The design was chosen by public competition, with the requirement that party political emblems were forbidden and the inclusion of the Stellone d'Italia, [...] "inspired by a sense of the earth and municipalities." [...] The five winners were assigned <b>further</b> <b>requirements</b> for the design of the emblem, [...] "a ring that has towered shaped crown," [...] surrounded by a garland of Italian foliage and flora. Below a representation of the sea, and above, the gold star, with the legend Unità e Libertà or Unity and Liberty in the Italian language. The winner was Paolo Paschetto, Professor of the Institute of Fine Arts in Rome from 1914 to 1948, and the design was presented in February 1947, together with the other finalists, in an exhibition in Via Margutta. This version, however, did not meet with public approval, so a new competition was held, again won by Paolo Paschetto. The new emblem was approved by the Constituent Assembly in February 1948, and officially adopted by the President of the Italian Republic, Enrico De Nicola in May 1948.|$|E
60|$|To {{continue}} {{these suggestions}} much further, {{would be to}} write a detailed treatise on education, which we do not purpose. The foregoing outlines of plans for exercising the perceptions in early childhood, for conducting object-lessons, for teaching drawing and geometry, must be considered simply as illustrations of the method dictated by the general principles previously specified. We believe that on examination they will be found not only to progress from the simple to the complex, from the indefinite to the definite, from the concrete to the abstract, from the empirical to the rational; but to satisfy the <b>further</b> <b>requirements,</b> that education shall be a repetition of civilisation in little, that it shall {{be as much as}} possible a process of self-evolution, and that it shall be pleasurable. The fulfilment of all these conditions by one type of method, tends alike to verify the conditions, and to prove that type of the method the right one. Mark too, that this method is the logical outcome of the tendency characterising all modern improvements in tuition--that it is but an adoption in full of the natural system which they adopt partially--that it displays this complete adoption of the natural system, both by conforming to the above principles, and by following the suggestions which the unfolding mind itself gives: facilitating its spontaneous activities, and so aiding the developments which Nature is busy with. Thus there seems abundant reason to conclude, that the mode of procedure above exemplified, closely approximates to the true one.|$|E
