5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{government}} {{found it}} bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, {{which had already}} been self-governing <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> and {{which was one of}} the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black nationalist leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.|$|E

25|$|These Soviet infractions {{remained}} a state secret <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> In many instances, the Russian biologists {{who had been}} on the whaling ships were prohibited from examining the carcasses or taking any biological measurements of these whales. Nevertheless, several biologists kept their own records of what the whalers caught, then kept these records secret. After the collapse of the Soviet government, the new Russian government released {{at least part of the}} data on the true catch data.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{was produced}} {{and directed by}} Rick Goldsmith and premiered the following year, in 1996. It covered Seldes's life and career, and revived the life and work {{of a man who}} <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> had been largely forgotten. The film looked at Seldes's life and work, especially the theme of censorship and suppression in America's news media. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, and received many other accolades, including the John O'Connor Film Award from the American Historical Association.|$|E
25|$|Moses Harry Horwitz (June 19, 1897 – May 4, 1975), known professionally as Moe Howard, was an American {{actor and}} comedian {{best known as}} the de facto leader of the Three Stooges, the farce comedy team who starred in motion {{pictures}} and television <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> That group originally started out as Ted Healy and His Stooges, an act that toured the vaudeville circuit. Moe's distinctive hairstyle came about {{when he was a boy}} and cut off his curls with a pair of scissors, producing a ragged shape approximating a bowl cut.|$|E

25|$|Toirdelbach {{was the son}} of Tadc mac Briain, son of Brian Bóruma, and Mór, {{daughter}} of Gilla Brigte Ua Maíl Muaid of Cenél Fiachach. His father was killed in 1023, probably on the orders of his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain who thereby made himself king of Munster. Donnchad, while he successfully retained control of Munster <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades,</b> was never able to achieve the same success as Brian. Epigraphic evidence shows that he aimed to be king of Ireland, and perhaps considered himself to be such, but the annalists and later historians recognised no such pretensions.|$|E
25|$|But {{before that}} time, {{the man who}} cast his shadow over the team <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades,</b> Boston Bruins superstar defenseman Eddie Shore, {{purchased}} the team in 1939. Industriously, he split games between the Bruins and the Indians, even {{going so far as}} to provoke a trade to the Amerks to make the train commute easier. He retired from the NHL after that season, but played for Springfield for two more seasons. Shore's often-controversial but ever-colorful management style would permeate the team for the next 36 years and provide generations of hockey players and fans with anecdotes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} cemetery is a smaller enclosure with just a single grave, that of Rabbi Yisrael ben Yeshaya who died in 1841. After his death, the position of Chief Rabbi in Gibraltar remained open <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> Adjacent to the wall surrounding the rabbi's tomb, is that of Rabbi Yitshak Halevi III. He died in 1847, {{the year before the}} cemetery's closing. By then, there was little remaining space in the graveyard, which would make sense of the south-north orientation of his tomb, compared to the east-west alignment of other graves. Another grave within Jews' Gate Cemetery is that of Rabbi Raphael Hayyim Moses Benaim.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> {{after its}} 1920 inception, the NFL {{successfully}} fended off several rival leagues. However, in 1960, it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League (AFL) was formed. The AFL vied heavily with the NFL for both players and fans, {{but by the}} middle of the decade the strain of competition led to serious merger talks between the two leagues. Prior to the 1966 season, the NFL and AFL reached a merger agreement that was to take effect for the 1970 season. As part of the merger, the champions of the two leagues agreed to meet in a world championship game for professional American football until the merger was effected.|$|E

25|$|During the French Revolution, the French National Assembly rewrote the {{criminal}} code in 1791, omitting all reference to homosexuality. During the Napoleonic wars, homosexuality was decriminalised in territories coming under French control, {{such as the}} Netherlands {{and many of the}} pre-unification German states, however in Germany this ended with the unification of the country under the Prussian Kaiser, as Prussia had long punished homosexuality harshly. On 6 August 1942, the Vichy government made homosexual relations with anyone under twenty-one illegal as part of its conservative agenda. Most Vichy legislation was repealed after the war– but the anti-gay Vichy law remained on the books <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> until it was finally repealed in August 1982 when the age of consent (15) was again made the same for heterosexual as well as homosexual partners.|$|E
25|$|In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Enver Hoxha, who led Albania <b>for</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades,</b> died on 11 April 1985. His successor, Ramiz Alia, {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{open up the}} regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in Shkodra and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition {{led to the formation}} of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.|$|E
