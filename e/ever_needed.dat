It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were <b>ever</b> <b>needed.</b> As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of the format used for the penalty shoot-out, specifically {{the way that the}} game was decided by kicks at goal attempted by players who wouldn't ordinarily kick the ball during a rugby match. One journalist commented that was a [...] "ludicrous" [...] way of deciding a game, while another believed it had turned the semi-final into a [...] "pantomime" [...] and was an [...] "unnecessarily demeaning way" [...] of deciding a winner. A review was promised by tournament organisers, and changes were made to the format ahead of the following season's tournament, though no other Heineken Cup match <b>ever</b> <b>needed</b> to be decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

500|$|... "Domino" [...] {{had been}} {{recorded}} {{many times before}} its release. The first was in sessions from September to November 1968, just after Astral Weeks was recorded. Morrison rearranged [...] "Domino" [...] frequently from 1968 to 1970, notably recording rap and harmony versions. For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4/4 tempo and features rhythm guitar. Horn overdubs were later added to the recording. Morrison ad libs {{between the end of}} the chorus and the start of the verses, when he shouts the words [...] "Dig it!", as well as near the end with [...] "And the band... one more time!", which, according to biographer Peter Mills, helps bring out the theme of [...] "liveliness" [...] in both the song and the album as a whole. The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer-songwriter, Fats Domino. As with [...] "Domino", Morrison first recorded [...] "If I <b>Ever</b> <b>Needed</b> Someone" [...] in late 1968; it is one of many blues-influenced tracks on the album.|$|E
500|$|John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, {{where in}} 1950 they {{embarked}} on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began {{in front of an}} audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: [...] "Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?" [...] Caitlin said in her memoir, [...] "Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>needed</b> encouragement less, and he was drowned in it." ...|$|E
