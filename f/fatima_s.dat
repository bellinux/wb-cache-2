40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention on active commuting by bicycle. Methods: An intervention study with workers from a metallurgical industry in Santa Catarina state, Brazil was carried out in 2011. A total of 464 individuals were placed in the intervention group (IG) and 468 in the control group (CG). The intervention consisted of strategies based on the transtheoretical model and stages of behavior change. The intervention group took part in activities for 6 months, including 23 meetings. The statistical analysis included intergroup comparison (IG × CG) at baseline and after the intervention. Intragroup analysis was performed 6 months after the intervention. Student's t-test, chi-square, and McNemar tests were used to analyze the data. Results: Of the original total, 876 individuals (94 %) participated in the study. The proportion of participants that used bicycles to commute to work (IG) increased significantly from baseline (45. 3 %) to the final interventional period (47. 5 %). No difference was found between the CG and the IG group after the interventional period. Conclusion: We suggest taking these findings into consideration in further studies to understand better the role of educational intervention on active commuting by bicycle. Ilca M. S.

40|$|The {{need for}} Muslim women’s {{emancipation}} is very often tied {{to what some}} scholars argue is the Islamic oppression and victimization of women; by a religion they argue is strictly patriarchal. As {{one of the greatest}} documented eras in medieval Islamic history, the Abbasid Caliphate, {{has been one of the}} most widely covered by researchers of Islamic history studies and will be the case study of this thesis. Through a historical analysis, this study finds that despite the extensive coverage by researchers of the period, research on women and their roles during the time has not yet claimed its rightful status. Indeed, in comparison to the studies of Islamic history, the study of Muslim women remains, at best, undeveloped. The lack of resources dealing with the roles of Muslim women in history and the subsequent sparse coverage of their achievements can be directly linked to the way people, both within academia and contemporary media, perceive women in Islam. This thesis merged the theories of Gaye Tuchman, <b>Fatima</b> Mernissi and <b>S.</b> Jay Kleinberg to form a troika through which the roles of Abbasid women may be re-assessed. As such, this research proposes a solution to remedy the invisibility of Muslim women and their roles in history: by creating a theoretical framework centred on the causes of said invisibility. In applying this framework, the thesis examines the textual materials by critically analysing the various aspects of women’s role in Abbasid society including political, social and religious facets of life in the Būyid and the Saljūq periods. This study of women, in said periods of Abbasid Iraq will highlight the major roles they played in shaping and developing Islamic society. It hence advances knowledge of this era in an original manner by the analysing of women’s history in Islam, via a new approach. Kuwait Cultural Office (the embassy of Kuwait...|$|R
