The second-stage filter uses coalescer inserts {{to achieve the}} final <b>de-oiling.</b> Coalescence is the breakdown of surface tension between oil droplets in an oil/water mixture which causes them to join and increase in size. The oil from the collecting spaces is drained away automatically or manually. In most modern ships, the oil from collecting spaces is drained away automatically.|$|E
50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by <b>de-oiling</b> petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E

40|$|The {{reproductive}} success of African penguins Spheniscus demersus at Dassen Island from 1994 to 2000 was variable, but {{much higher than}} previously reported figures for the species. Breeding success {{was positively related to}} the abundance of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax, and the high reproductive output during the study was attributed to the large biomass and high availability of these two species for much of the study period. <b>De-oiled</b> penguins from the Apollo Sea spill had a slightly lower hatching success but a significantly lower overall breeding success than that of un-oiled birds, driven mainly by the reduced number of chicks which fledged. Nests with two <b>de-oiled</b> Apollo Sea parents were less successful than nests with one <b>de-oiled</b> bird. There was increased mortality of chicks 40 days and older in nests with <b>de-oiled</b> birds. Chicks from nests with one <b>de-oiled</b> Apollo Sea parent grew at a similar rate to chicks from nests with no <b>de-oiled</b> parents. However, chicks from nests that comprised two <b>de-oiled</b> Apollo Sea birds had significantly slower growth rates than these other two groups. Breeding success and chick growth at nests with <b>de-oiled</b> birds were more negatively impacted when feeding conditions were less favourable. These results suggest that {{one of the main reasons}} for lower breeding success in <b>de-oiled</b> birds was their reduced ability to provision chicks, especially during the period in which the energy demands of the chicks is greatest.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in making {{paraffin}} wax is to remove the oil (<b>de-oiling</b> or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed {{with one or more}} solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil in the solution. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called [...] "product wax" [...] (or [...] "press wax") and [...] "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined). The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.|$|E
50|$|An {{oil water}} {{separation}} hydrocyclone is a device designed to separate oil from water {{by the use}} of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long tapered pipes. They typically contain an inlet section, long tapered section and a long outlet section. In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better <b>de-oiling</b> hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity. This is why smaller emulsified oil droplets as low as 15 microns can be removed.|$|E

Gas chromatographic analysis of individual hydrocarbon composition of the high boiling slack wax and its structural-group compos ition by the method of IR Fourier spectroscopy has been determined, experiments on the <b>de-oiling</b> on installation that simulates the operation of industrial crystallizers has been done. It is established that the <b>de-oiling</b> process of the high-boiling slack wax by static crystallization is obtained tightened in time and economically impractical.

The impact of oil removal on cattle performance has been minimally researched. Thus four trials, one growing, one digestion, and two feedlot, were designed to determine the energy and feeding value of <b>de-oiled</b> distillers grains in beef cattle diets. In growing cattle diets, diet concentration of modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) impacted cattle performance more than oil content. Ending BW, ADG, and G:F did not differ between cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> or full fat MDGS, however cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS had lower DMI than those fed full fat MDGS. No significant differences in fiber digestibility were observed between <b>de-oiled</b> and full fat MDGS treatments. The energy value of <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS in growing cattle diets was calculated to be 124 % the value of corn. In finishing steer diets, increasing diet concentrations of <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS increased G:F. However, decreasing MDGS fat content from 12. 0 % to 7. 2 % decreased steer performance by 3. 4 %. No significant interactions were observed when increasing concentrations of <b>de-oiled</b> wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) were fed with steam flaked (SFC) or dry rolled corn (DRC).

A commercial deep-fat fryer with the basket loaded with potatoes and a sample holder was used to fry potato slices, non-pretreated, blanched in hot water (85 ?C/ 3. 5 min) and rinsed in 3 percent NaCl solution (25 ?C/ 5 min). A <b>de-oiling</b> step (350 1 rpm and 457 1 rpm) for 1 min was conducted after the frying (145 ?, 165 ? and 185 ?C or 165 ?C) and cooling (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 s or 0. 60 and 120 s) steps. Lower frying temperature, higher centrifuge speed, and shorter cooling time resulted in the lowest oil uptake in potato chips. Pre-treatments (blanching and soaking) decreased (5 percent and by at least 10 percent), respectively, compared to the untreated chips. <b>De-oiling</b> led to increased hardness of the chips fried at 145 ? and 165 ?C (0 s cooling time), and the hardness decreased as cooling time. Pre-treatments (blanching and soaking) increased hardness (by 46 percent and 38 percent) and decreased work (by 20 percent and 27 percent), respectively, so that, during rupture, the pre-treated chips resulted in more crunchiness and firmness than the untreated chips. Potato chips showed less lightness and redness when fried at 145 ?C, and more lightness and redness when fried at 185 ?C; yellowness increased b* values as temperature increased. As cooling time increased, the lightness of the chips decreased, and the redness and the yellowness of the chips increased. Pre-treated samples resulted in increasing in lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*), whereas the redness (a*) values of the final products fluctuated. Higher frying temperature, centrifuge speed, and higher cooling time usually resulted in increasing shrinkage in thickness of potato chips; the chips fried at 165 ?C resulted in increasing in thickness.

40|$|Before {{they can}} be re-smelted and fed back into the raw [...] {{material}} cycle, oil-contaminated metallic grinding sludges from the metal and steel industries must have {{the greater part of}} all hydrocarbons removed from them. Currently, there is no full-scale <b>de-oiling</b> process avialable, although various <b>de-oiling</b> processes involving thermal and extractive procedures are being developed. NOELL Abfall- und Energietechnik GmbH has developed a washing process to de-oil rough metal-shavings which it is possible to modify so that the residues from the rolling of steel and metallic grinding sludges can be de-oiled. After screening, the materials are conditioned and then a detergent is added. Subsequently, the material is washed in one or more wash-stages and finally the product, now free of oil, is de-watered. According to its use, it can be further dried and briquetted (for use in the smelting bath) or left moist (for use in the blast furnace, after pre-treatment in the sintering plant). The process parameters for the removal of oil from these residues are determined in laboratory experiments. At the pilot-plants level, a continuous removal of oil from metallic grinding sludge (26 - 35 % oil content) to give a residue containing < 1 % hydrocarbons was attained. In removing oil from this sludge, an oil content of < 1 % in the residue is technically possible using the washing process which has been developed. This oil content is sufficiently low for the material to be used in a pyrometallurgical process and thus recycled. (orig.)

40|$|Dry-milling ethanol plants produce {{distillers}} grains (DG) and condensed distillers solubles (CDS). Before {{thin stillage}} is evaporated to CDS, corn oil is removed via centrifugation, producing <b>de-oiled</b> CDS. Depending on plant availability, CDS can be marketed or combined with DG to produce <b>de-oiled</b> distillers grains plus solubles (DGS). Currently, {{there are no}} data available on animal performance when corn oil is removed via centrifugation of the solubles stream. Therefore, two finishing experiments, a metabolism experiment, and a growing experiment were conducted to evaluate the effects of corn oil removal on cattle performance, carcass characteristics, and the effects on nutrient digestibility. Oil concentration {{had no effect on}} DMI, ADG, G:F, and carcass characteristics in finishing cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> or normal DGS or CDS. Regardless of oil concentration, steers fed DGS or CDS had greater ADG and were more efficient than the corn-based control.

Six barrows (29. 6 ± 2. 3 kg) fitted with ileal T-cannula were allotted into a 6 × 6 Latin square design. Each period was comprised of a 5 -d adaption period followed by a 2 -d collection of ileal digesta. The five test diets contained 62 % DDGS as the sole source of AA. A nitrogen-free diet {{was used to measure}} the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. Chromic oxide (0. 3 %) was used as an index in each diet. The results showed that CP and AA were very similar in 5 DDGS, but the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of lysine (from 56. 16 % to 71. 15 %) and tryptophan (from 54. 90 % to 68. 38 %) had the lowest values and largest variation within the essential AA, which suggests reduced availability of AA and different levels of Maillard reactions in the five DDGS. The apparent ileal digestibility and SID of CP and most of AA in full-oil DDGS (sources 1 and 2) were greater (p 0. 05) than full-oil with high CDS ratio DDGS (source 2); however, the SID of most AA of <b>de-oiled</b> with low CDS ratios DDGS (source 3) were non-significantly lower (p> 0. 05) than <b>de-oiled</b> with high CDS ratio DDGS (source 4); and the <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS with middle CDS ratio (source 5) but with different drying processing had the lowest SID AA values. In conclusion, <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS had lower SID of CP and AA than full-oil DDGS; a higher CDS ratio tended to decrease the SID of AA in full-oil DDGS but not in <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS; and compared with CDS ratio, processing, especially drying, may have more of an effect on AA digestibility of DDGS...|$|R

The kinetics of oil absorption and oil distribution in the potato chips (total, internal, and surface oil content) was studied so that effectiveness of the <b>de-oiling</b> system could be established. An analysis of product quality attributes (PQA) such as moisture content, oil content, microstructure, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion, as well as, bulk density, true density, and porosity of chips fried at different temperatures (120, 130, and 140 degrees C) was performed in order to evaluate the effect of process temperature on the product. Moreover, heat capacity of the chips and convective heat transfer coefficient at the oil-chip interface were determined for the same temperature range. The final oil content of the potato chips was 0. 072 ? 0. 004, 0. 062 ? 0. 003, and 0. 059 ? 0. 003 g/g solid for frying temperatures of 120, 130, and 140 degrees C, respectively. These values are lower (80 - 85 percent less) than those found in traditionally-fried potato chip which indicates that the <b>de-oiling</b> mechanism is crucial in vacuum frying processing.

It was found that the rate of change in PQAs is greatly affected by temperature; however, the final values of moisture content, bulk density, true density, porosity, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion were not affected by temperature. During vacuum frying, the specific heat of potato chips decreased with time as water decreases.

All experimentations were conducted in the experimental station of the National Superior School of Agriculture (ENSA) of Thies University (Senegal). In the same way, all chemical analyses were performed in the feed science laboratory of the Department of Animal Production of ENSA. The {{first part of this}} study was a description of toxic and anti-nutritional compounds present in J. curcas seed meal, which most important are phorbol esters, characteristics of Euphorbiaceae, known for its inflammatory effects, and curcin, a toxalbumin which manifested by an irritant action. Other compounds, also present, interfere more or less with digestive process in animals. Different treatments were applied, with different levels of success, to reduce or eliminate these toxic and anti-nutritional compounds for the valuation of this meal in animal feed. A particular emphasis was placed on the biological treatment, not only for a significant reduction of these compounds but also to improve the nutritional quality of the meal. The second part of this work has focused on the study of the effect of the J. curcas kernel meal obtained by chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> incorporated in corn at 4, 8, and 12 % and distributed to broiler chickens at the end their growth phase to assess their feed intake, their daily weight gain and diet digestibility. For all diets, feed intake was inversely influenced by the incorporation on the jatropha kernel meal, leading a weight gain decrease in animals that received the largest amounts of jatropha despite the absence of toxicity signs and mortality. Similarly, the apparent digestibility of each nutrient has been affected by the incorporation of jatropha kernel meal as well as the differential digestibility thereof. The low digestibility, especially protein was explained by the low availability of meal proteins incorporated corn, but also the presence of anti-nutritional and toxic factors still present in the diets used. The third part of this work has presented results of two experimentations conducted successively. The first one studied the effect of jatropha kernel meal obtained by a chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> incorporated in diets at 4 and 8 %, on broiler chickens performance during growing/finishing. The second experimentation studied the effect of the same cake that was heat treated before incorporated in diets at 8 %, on day-old broiler chicks’ performance. In one as the other experimentation, feed intake and daily weight gain were affected by the incorporation of jatropha kernel meal. It was the same for the total mortality rates recorded despite the absence of visible signs of toxicity. These experimentations confirmed other experimentations have shown that the <b>de-oiling</b> of jatropha kernel meal followed by heat treatment, even if it caused a significant reduction of anti-nutritional compounds, did not remove all the toxic factors that may even interfere with feed intake and weight gain of animals. These observations were not confirmed in the fourth part, which studied the effects of jatropha kernel meal obtained by chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> subject to heat treatment then biological treatment with Aspergillus niger and incorporated in diets at 8 %, on day-old broiler chicks performance. Indeed, the feed intake, the weight gain as well as the viability of animals were not affected by the incorporation of jatropha. These successive studies were among the first which interested the same animal species at different levels of development based on a product whose nutritional quality is proven, but has toxic and anti-nutritional factors could not be completely eliminated despite different treatments applied. The application of heat treatment may have helped to reduce some anti-nutritional compounds (curcin and trypsin inhibitor) but without improve feed intake and weight gain. Considering the reaction of animals subjected to diet, biological and heat treatments may have reduced the toxicity of jatropha kernel meal, which has afected the feed intake of animals and thus the weight gain. This study showed that, despite its nutritional level, J. curcas kernel meal presented limitations in its use as a raw material that can integrate a ration for broilers in Senegal but hopes remain with biological treatments...|$|E

40|$|With {{the large}} {{expansion}} of the ethanol industry in previous years, {{there has been an}} increase in supply of distillers grains plus solubles (DGS) for the feedlot industry. Distiller’s grains are a common byproduct used in feedlot diets for added protein or energy. Recently, ethanol companies have been using different extraction techniques to remove various parts of the DGS to sell separately, such as corn oil and fiber. Previous research trials have tried to determine the contribution of individual nutrients in distillers grains that improve performance in order to predict the impact of removing certain components. In previous studies, fiber has shown the greatest contribution; however, no sole nutrient has been identified that contributes to providing equal performance to distillers grains. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the value of the fiber in modified distillers grains plus solubles for finishing cattle performance. In that study, the conclusion was made that the isolated fiber component does not give equal performance to feeding MDGS due to a reduction in G:F and feeding value if only the fiber components replaced corn, which means the energy in MDGS is provided by other components to make it better than corn. Some producers are concerned that feeding <b>de-oiled</b> DGS will {{have a negative impact on}} finishing cattle performance. Currently, some feedlots have been adding corn oil back to diets to ensure they are getting the best performance possible. Although corn oil has been added to diets in the past and experiments have been done to evaluate <b>de-oiled</b> versus normal DGS, there has never been a study that evaluated the removal of corn oil from distillers grains compared to adding corn oil back to <b>de-oiled</b> distillers grains. Therefore, two finishing studies were completed to determine the effects of the removal of corn oil from modified distillers grains plus solubles and replacement with supplemental corn oil on finishing cattle performance and total tract digestibility. When corn oil was added back to MDGS, there was a negative impact on digestibility of OM and NDF as well as lower DE (Mcal/kg) compared with <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS or full fat MDGS. When 2 % corn oil was added back to <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS, there was a 4. 9 % improvement in F:G compared to <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS. There was a numerical improvement in F:G by 3. 7 % for MDGS + Oil compared to FF MDGS. Advisor: Galen E. Erickso...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Clay {{samples of}} six {{different}} locations of Kurdistan region were characterized. Chemical compositions of the clays were found using XRF technique for the clay powders. The mineralogy {{of the samples}} by XRD shows that the clay samples are mostly mixed layer type of Chlorite/Smectite composition with different types and quantities of mineral impurities. Specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) for the clay samples were determined by methylene blue adsorption method. Although the de-oiled spent clays have less SSA and CEC compared with their virgin samples, but their adsorption efficiency is 70 - 80 % higher than their virgin clays due {{to the increase in}} the organophilic character of the de-oiled spent clays, while acid activation of the natural clays has no significant effect on the adsorption efficiency. Charcoal, the universal adsorbent, has removed 58 % of 50 ppm phenol solution, while de-oiled spent clays have removed 80 - 95 % of the phenol concentration.

40|$|A batch vacuum frying system, which {{processes}} {{fruits and}} vegetables, includes a frying pan, a surface-condenser, and a vacuum pump. With {{health and safety}} issues in mind, this research focused on developing a modified surface-condenser to prevent cavitation of the vacuum pump. The final oil-content was reduced by centrifugal de- oiling of the product under vacuum, which make the product healthier than what is currently available. The <b>de-oiling</b> mechanism consists of a centrifuge with a motor attached to the basket shaft, rotating up to 750 rpm (63 g units). The condenser consists of a (counter- flow) spiral-coil heat exchanger (SHE) connected to a refrigeration system that uses R 404 a refrigerant. <b>De-oiling</b> for 40 s at 300 and 750 RPM removed up to 67 % and 72 % of the chip?s surface oil, respectively. At 750 RPM for 10 s, 40 s, and 60 s the oil-content was reduced by 38 %, 44 %, and 51 %, respectively. The convective heat transfer coefficient (h) of the frying oil was determined at 120 ?C and 140 ?C using the lumped capacitance method. The h-values were 217 ? 13 W/m 2 K (120 ?C) and 258 ? 37 W/m 2 K (140 ?C) using a copper-ball thermocouple. The h- values increased to 3. 6 times during the boiling period. COMSOLTM Multiphysics was used to model the heat transfer in the vacuum fryer pan. Based on the simulation results, a 1. 5 cm thick insulation material was installed in the fryer to reduce the energy losses. The refrigeration system operates at Tevap = - 26 ?C and Tcond = 50 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling. Sensitivity analysis showed that the system Coefficient of Performance (COP) was about 3. 87 at these conditions and compressor power requirement (CPR) was 74 W (85 % efficiency) when frying 30 g of potatoes slices. The best results were obtained at Tevap = - 10 ?C and Tcond = 40 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling and superheat of 5 ?C. The predicted COP was 4 and the CPR 70 W. The ice-formation on coils reduced the condensation rate. Reducing the refrigerant temperature to - 10 ?C (from - 26 ?C) reduced the condensation rate by 30 %. These results show a more effective vacuum frying system for high-quality fruits and vegetables than the system previously used...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha curcas is an {{upcoming}} oil-seed plant with increasing cultivation area each year throughout the tropics. After <b>de-oiling</b> the seeds, a protein-rich meal (JKM) is left behind, {{which has a}} similar amino acid composition and content compared to fishmeal. To test JKM as an alternative protein source, a mixed diet was formulated in which 25 % of the total dietary protein was derived from fishmeal and the rest from soybean meal, rice bran and wheat meal (control). Three further isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets replacing 30 %, 70 % or 100 %, respectively, of the fishmeal protein with JKM were produced and fed to juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) for 8 weeks. There {{were no significant differences}} in growth parameters between all treatments containing JKM, however, regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation of JKM content to final weight and specific growth rate. The 70 % and 100 % replacement levels showed higher body lipid and significantly lower ash content.

40|$|Edible {{vegetable}} oil seeds {{are used to}} produce oil for human consumption and inedible {{vegetable oil}} seeds are used to produce biofuels; the residue cakes from the extraction process contain significant energy that can be utilised. This study {{is a continuation of}} previous work on oil extraction from flaxseed to produce biodiesel; herein, the residue cake from flaxseed was studied. Three different types of samples (powdered seeds, <b>de-oiled</b> cake, and in situ transesterified cake of flaxseed) were torrefied (through slow pyrolysis), and the sample properties were characterized. The higher heating value (HHV= 36. 01 ± 0. 36  MJ[*]kg− 1) and bulk density (0. 33 ± 0. 01  g[*]cm− 3) of the powdered seeds are higher compared to the other two samples (i. e. <b>de-oiled</b> cake and in situ transesterified cake). The torrefied biomass was light weight losing its mechanical strength on treatment, making it easier to grind. It was observed that the biomass torrefied at 300 [*]°C had a higher fraction of particles between sieve sizes (between 2. 0 and 0. 063  mm) compared to the biomass torrefied at 200 [*]°C. The sieve sizes between 0. 5 and 0. 063  mm showed that more particles of the torrefied biomass treated at 300 [*]°C were collected compared to that torrefied at 200 [*]°C. Due to the loss of hydrogen and oxygen content and the removal of water, the carbon content in the torrefied biomass increased by 25. 52, 24. 51, and 22. 69 [*]% for the powdered seeds, <b>de-oiled</b> cake, and in situ cake samples, respectively. The powdered seeds had a higher carbon and hydrogen content compared to the <b>de-oiled</b> and in situ transesterified flaxseed cakes because the powdered seeds contained fatty acids. The powdered seeds had a higher concentration of CO 2 gas liberated during treatment compared to the <b>de-oiled</b> and in situ transesterified cakes. This was attributed to the powdered seeds having a higher concentration of volatile hydrocarbons and a lower ash content. It was observed that the energy ratios were reduced with respect to increasing temperature whereas the highest energy ratios were found for the powdered seeds...|$|R
