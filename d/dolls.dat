5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn <b>dolls</b> {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing <b>dolls</b> in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn <b>dolls.</b> In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the <b>dolls</b> began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the <b>dolls</b> to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn <b>dolls</b> have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn <b>dolls,</b> some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the <b>dolls.</b> Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn <b>dolls</b> rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the <b>dolls</b> helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
