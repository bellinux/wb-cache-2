2500|$|A <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper. [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|E

5000|$|The {{advent of}} the {{microcomputer}} and digital photography {{has led to the}} rise of digital prints. These prints are created from stored graphic formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and RAW. The types of printers used include inkjet printers, <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer,</b> laser printers, and thermal printers. Inkjet prints are sometimes given the coined name [...] "Giclée".|$|E
50|$|<b>Dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> {{have some}} {{drawbacks}} compared to inkjet printers. Each of the colored panels of the ribbons, and the thermal head itself, must match {{the size of}} the media that is being printed on. Furthermore, only specially coated paper or specific plastics can accept the sublimated ink. This means that <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> cannot match the flexibility of inkjet printers in printing {{on a wide range of}} media.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers,</b> where a {{solid ink}} (dye) is {{converted}} to a gaseous state (sublimation) and applied on the print medium, where it immediately solidifies.|$|R
50|$|Also, dye-sublimation {{papers and}} ribbons are {{sensitive}} to skin oils, which interfere with the dye's ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper. They must also be free of dust particles, {{which can lead to}} small colored blobs appearing on the prints. Most <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> have filters and/or cleaning rollers to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher density levels and virtually no metamerism or bronzing.|$|R
50|$|Digital textile {{printing}} {{started in the}} late 1980s as a possible replacement for analog screen printing. With {{the development of a}} <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> in the early 1990s, it became possible to print with low energy sublimation inks and high energy disperse direct inks directly onto textile media, as opposed to print dye-sublimation inks on a transfer paper and, in a separate process using a heat press, transfer it to the fabric.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> (or dye-sub printer) is {{a printer}} which employs a {{printing}} process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium {{such as a}} plastic card, paper or canvas. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> is a {{computer}} printer which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic, card, paper, or fabric. The sublimation name was first applied because the dye was considered {{to make the transition}} between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage. This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect. There is some liquifying of the dye. Since then, the process is sometimes known as dye-diffusion, though this has not eliminated the original name. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints, ID cards, clothing, and more.|$|E
50|$|These {{disadvantages}} mean that, {{despite their}} marked superiority in producing good photographic and non-linear diagrammatic output, <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> remain niche products, and devices using higher resolution, lower color depth, and dither patterns remain the norm.|$|R
50|$|Alps Electric {{produced}} the first quality dye-sub printers for home {{consumers in the}} $500-$1,000 price range, bringing dye-sublimation technology within the reach of a wider audience. Now there are many <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> on the market starting from as low as $100, especially postcard-sized mobile photo printers.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, the {{advantage}} of dye-sublimation printing has been {{the fact that it}} is a continuous-tone technology, where each dot can be any color. In contrast, inkjet printers can vary the location and size of ink droplets, a process called dithering, but each drop of ink is limited to the colors of the inks installed. Consequently, a <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> produces true continuous tones appearing much like a chemical photograph. An inkjet print is composed of droplets of ink layered and scattered to simulate continuous tones, but under magnification the individual droplets can be seen. In the early days of inkjet printing, the large droplets and low resolution made inkjet prints significantly inferior to dye-sublimation, but some of today's inkjets produce extremely high quality prints using microscopic droplets and supplementary ink colors, producing superior color fidelity to dye-sublimation.|$|E
5000|$|For {{environments that}} print {{confidential}} or secret documents, a <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> {{is a potential}} security risk that must be handled carefully. Due to the mechanism of printing, a perfect color-separated negative image of the printed page is created on the supply roll color panels, and the [...] "waste roll" [...] of dye panels can be unrolled to see everything that has been printed with the printer. For such environments, the waste roll should be shredded or incinerated onsite rather than simply being discarded in the trash. Also, for home users, the waste roll from a photo printer can be similarly recovered from the garbage and used to see everything that has been printed. Since the supply roll is plastic, the lifespan of a used roll can be years or decades long, permitting image recovery long after disposal.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers</b> use CMYO (Cyan Magenta Yellow Overcoating) colors, which {{differs from}} the more {{recognized}} CMYK colors in that the black is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is also stored on the ribbon and is effectively a thin layer which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air, while also rendering the print water-resistant.|$|R
5000|$|Printing {{typically}} {{uses the}} CMYK color space (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Very few printing processes {{do not include}} black; however, those processes (with the exception of <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers)</b> are poor at representing low saturation, low intensity colors. Efforts {{have been made to}} expand the gamut of the printing process by adding inks of non-primary colors; these are typically orange and green (see Hexachrome) or light cyan and light magenta (see CcMmYK color model). Spot color inks of a very specific color are also sometimes used.|$|R
5000|$|The units {{typically}} {{consist of}} an order station connected {{to one or}} more <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer(s)</b> in a single unit. These stations are typically installed in a retail location such as Kodak Express stores, supermarkets and drugstores offering both instant print and behind the counter services. The kiosks allow printing digital photos from digital media (such as a CD or a digital memory card), as well as the ability to scan existing photos and perform simple edits and photo-enhancements via the touch screen interface. Some systems are set up as [...] "order stations" [...] that print to a digital minilab in addition to (or instead of) printing the pictures instantly.|$|R
5000|$|As dye-sublimation thermal {{printers}} utilize heat {{to transfer}} the dye onto the print media, the printing speed {{is limited by the}} speed at which the elements on the thermal head can change temperature. Heating the elements is easy, as a strong electric current can raise the temperature of an element very quickly. However, cooling the elements down, when changing from a darker to a lighter color, is harder and usually involves having a fan/heatsink assembly attached to the print head. The use of multiple heads can also speed up this process, since one head can cool down while another is printing. Although print times vary among different dye-sublimation printers, a typical cheap home-use dye-sub printer can print a 6" [...] x 4" [...] photo in 45 - 90 seconds. More heavy-duty printers can print much faster; for example, a Sinfonia Colorstream S2 <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> can print a 6" [...] x 4" [...] photo in as little as 6.8 seconds, and a Mitsubishi CP-D707DW is known to have a faster print of under 6 seconds for similar size. In all cases, the finished print is completely dry once it emerges from the printer.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{printing}} {{technology can be}} used to produce color images by adhering a wax-based ink onto paper. As the paper and ribbon travel in unison beneath the thermal print head, the wax-based ink from the transfer ribbon melts onto the paper. When cooled, the wax is permanently adhered to the paper. This type of thermal printer uses a like-sized panel of ribbon for each page to be printed, regardless of the contents of the page. Monochrome printers have a black panel for each page to be printed, while color printers have either three (CMY) or four (CMYK) colored panels for each page. Unlike <b>dye-sublimation</b> <b>printers,</b> these printers cannot vary the dot intensity, which means that images must be dithered. Although acceptable in quality, the printouts from these printers cannot compare with modern inkjet printers and color laser printers. Currently, this type of printer is rarely used for full-page printing, and is now employed for industrial label printing due to its waterfastness and speed. These printers are considered highly reliable due to their small number of moving parts. Printouts from color thermal printers using wax are sensitive to abrasion, as the wax ink can be scraped, rubbed off, or smeared. However, wax-resin compounds and full resins can be used on materials such as polypropylene or polyester in order to increase durability.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{decoration}} used on T-shirts include airbrush, applique, embroidery, impressing or embossing, and the ironing on of either flock lettering, heat transfers, or <b>dye-sublimation</b> transfers. Laser <b>printers</b> {{are capable of}} printing on plain paper using a special toner containing sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.|$|R
