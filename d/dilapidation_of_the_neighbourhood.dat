50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church <b>of</b> Southwick, that parish was {{annexed to}} Colvend, {{with which it}} has been united from <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation.|$|R
50|$|In 1750, Germain-Louis de Chauvelin, lord since 1734, asserting <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, {{obtained}} authorisation {{to reduce}} the towers and the curtains to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first floor, excepting however the Saint-Jean tower, the manorial symbol.|$|R
50|$|On account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vaults and <b>the</b> {{ever-increasing}} volume <b>of</b> trade, <b>the</b> Senate <b>of</b> Bremen issued <b>the</b> First Exchange Ordinance on 14 March 1682, as {{a result}} <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> architect Jean Baptiste Broebes began construction of a single story building in the Baroque style above the cellar in 1687. A second story, designed by Giselher von Warneck was built between 1734 and 1736.|$|R
5000|$|In 1714 Tenison {{inherited}} considerable estates {{from his}} uncle, Edward Tenison of Lambeth, who was steward to Archbishop Tenison and left £12,000; but he subsequently {{lost most of}} his wealth in 1720 by investing it in the South Sea Company. In 1715 he acted as executor to his cousin the archbishop, and was in consequence involved in litigation on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>dilapidations</b> with Archbishop William Wake. Correspondence on the subject was published by him in 1716. The surveyor involved in estimating <b>the</b> <b>dilapidations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episcopal palaces was John James, who defended himself in print against what he called Tenison's [...] "cavils and misrepresentations". Wake asked for <b>dilapidations</b> <b>of</b> £3469. <b>The</b> claim was referred to Peter King, Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Common Pleas, and John Bettesworth, Dean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arches, as arbitrators, with <b>the</b> Bishop <b>of</b> Lichfield as moderator. The arbitrators awarded Wake £2800.|$|R
50|$|Due to <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second bridge, a third {{version was}} {{constructed}} in 1929 using reinforced concrete. Because of water diversion projects along the Shinano River throughout the early 20th century, the water level at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> construction had decreased from 770 meters to 270 meters since <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first bridge. Because <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> third bridge was far shorter yet wider {{in order to allow}} for easy passage of automobiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow in Bessergenevskaya village {{dates back}} to 1647. In 1797, due to <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old church, a new, wooden one with a bell tower was built. The latter was consecrated in 1800 also in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Metropolitan Alexius. In 1810 the stanitsa {{moved to a new}} place. The temple was also transferred. In 1858, it was moved again, this time to Kazachy-Kadamovsky khutor.|$|R
5000|$|This {{objectification}} of her identity, and the society's undeterred unacceptability of her 'self', stimulated her ornamentation {{of rebellion}} {{as a mean to}} attain liberation and emancipation; <b>the</b> replacement <b>of</b> imposed [...] "roles" [...] with obvious [...] "duties"; <b>the</b> denouncement <b>of</b> [...] "grahastha ashram" [...] as a subjugating phase <b>of</b> life; and <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's [...] "remaining dignity" [...] because of society's inability {{to understand her}} plight, where Varma concludes her essay.|$|R

50|$|In the 1580s, {{permission}} {{was given}} to Thomas Lewis to use stone from nearby Caerphilly Castle to build a manor house. The resulting building was known as Van Castle, Castell y Fan, or simply 'The Van'. The building {{was seen as an}} innovation of its day but its construction led to <b>the</b> further <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original castle in Caerphilly. Van Castle was abandoned in the mid-18th century when the Lewis family moved to St Fagans Castle.|$|R

50|$|In 1976, {{after years}} <b>of</b> {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train depot {{on the original}} Homestead property, the Florida East Coast Railway planned a demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depot. A group of local leaders raised $25,000 to stop the demplition and move the depot to the property behind the Florida Pioneer Museum. Another $200,000 was put into <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depot in 1988. Unfortunately, Hurricane Andrew leveled the depot in 1992. The current train depot on the property is a replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|R
50|$|The Hostafrancs metro station, on Barcelona Metro line L1, {{is located}} in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> <b>The</b> Plaça d'Espanya, along with the Espanya metro and railway station, lies on <b>the</b> eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> Barcelona's main Sants railway station is just outside <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood,</b> to <b>the</b> north.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> {{is divided}} by Heron Road but is {{considered}} all one <b>neighbourhood.</b> <b>The</b> city <b>of</b> Ottawa refers to <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> as Clementine, and <b>the</b> northern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> {{is sometimes called}} Billings Bridge. <b>The</b> total population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> is 3,829 (Canada 2011 Census).|$|R

25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Canal south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River {{was ruined}} {{for several years}} after 1128, when Du Chong decided to break the dykes and dams holding back <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yellow River in order to decimate the {{oncoming}} Jurchen invaders during the Jin–Song wars. The Jurchen Jin dynasty continually battled with the Song in the region between the Huai River and the Yellow River; this warfare led to <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal until the Mongols invaded in the 13th century AD and began necessary repairs.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{buildings}} in Fairmont were poorly constructed. By 1852—little more than 30 {{years after the}} city's founding—a large portion of Fairmont {{was reported to be}} run-down and dilapidated. Reports from 1873 indicate that these buildings had continued to fall into disrepair. On April 2, 1876, a fire destroyed a large portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's business district, as well as many houses in the area. <b>The</b> continuing <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's buildings {{may have contributed to the}} fire; <b>the</b> large number <b>of</b> coal mines under Fairmont may have also played a role.|$|R

5000|$|Frustrated {{with the}} {{obsolescence}} and increasing <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polo Grounds, Stoneham seriously considered having the Giants become tenants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yankees in the Bronx. He also considered {{moving to a}} proposed stadium {{that would have been}} owned by the city. [...] However, when both of those plans fizzled, the Giants announced on August 19, 1957, that they would move following that season, after nearly three-quarters of a century, to San Francisco, California, following the Dodgers to the West Coast. The Giants had won five World Series in the Polo Grounds.|$|R
5000|$|But on March 22, 1312, Clement V promulgated {{the bull}} Vox in excelsis {{in which he}} stated that {{although}} there was not sufficient reason to condemn the Order, for the common good, <b>the</b> hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order by Philip IV, the scandal brought about by their trial, and <b>the</b> likely <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order that would result from the trial, the Order was to be suppressed by the pope’s authority over it. But the order explicitly stated that dissolution was enacted, [...] "with a sad heart, not by definitive sentence, but by apostolic provision." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{borough council}} began {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>of</b> Bewbush in 1974, with a leisure centre opening in 1984, and a shopping parade the following year.

Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> continued into <b>the</b> 1990s.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2001 federal census, {{approximately}} half (55.8%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residences in <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> were constructed during the 1980s. Another 41.9% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residences were built during the 1990s.

60|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the postern door was cautiously opened, a white face was protruded into the lane, and a hand was seen beckoning to the watchers. In dead silence the three passed the door, which was immediately locked behind them, and followed their guide through several garden alleys to <b>the</b> kitchen entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. A single candle burned in the great paved kitchen, which was destitute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customary furniture; and as the party proceeded to ascend from thence by a flight of winding stairs, a prodigious noise of rats testified still more plainly to <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1981, {{the film}} follows <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> Satoru Watarai (Hamada) from 12 to 30 years old. After {{dropping}} out of Junior High School, Watarai has resolved never to set foot outside his danchi (Japanese apartment complex). As he watches his classmates gradually move away, he begins a daily routine of exercise, martial arts and security patrols which he believes will protect the danchi and preserve its way <b>of</b> life. <b>The</b> film also explores Watarai's struggle to build relationships, make a living and deal with <b>the</b> <b>dilapidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> Japan's bubble economy.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> unit is {{a notable}} aspect <b>of</b> designs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new town {{movement}} [...] <b>The</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> unit {{seems to have}} an uneasy relationship to the Garden City Movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same period - consider garden suburbs. Raymond Unwin - an architect working for Ebenezer Howard - was an advocate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> unit.|$|R
