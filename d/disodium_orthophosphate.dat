40|$|Control, acid or buffer {{solution}} was infused intraruminally into cows eating highly digestible grass-based pasture and {{the rates of}} neutral detergent fibre (NDF) degradation of 4 highly digestible ryegrasses were determined using the nylon bag technique.

Cows receiving acid or buffer infusion had a slower rate of NDF degradation than cows receiving the control infusion. The rate of NDF degradation did not decrease as the proportion of NDF in the grass increased. The composition and structural arrangement of NDF was likely to have differed between pasture sources. The cellulolytic pH threshold for highly digestible pasture in grazing cows remains poorly defined because variations in pH are likely to be as, or more, important than a mean value...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} the setting time, compressive strength, and pH of white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) mixed with various additives: Calcium chloride (CaCl 2), calcium formate (CaF), <b>disodium</b> hydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> (Na 2 HPO 4). Materials and Methods: Group 1 (Control) was obtained by mixing MTA with distilled water. In Groups 2 and 3, MTA containing 10 % CaCl 2 and 20 % CaF, respectively, was mixed with distilled water. In Group 4, MTA was mixed with 15 % Na 2 HPO 4. Setting time, compressive strength, and pH of each group were examined. Statistical Analysis Used: Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14. A P-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant.

40|$|Sediment {{formation}} {{was investigated}} during UHT treatment of goats' milk, subjected to indirect treatment at 140 degrees C for 2 s, with upstream homogenisation. Stabilisers evaluated were sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), trisodium citrate (TSC), <b>disodium</b> hydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> (DSHP), and {{sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate}} (SDHP). With no added stabiliser, goats' milk produced a heavy sediment on UHT treatment. Addition of SDHP reduced pH, {{had little effect on}} ionic calcium and did not substantially reduce sediment. However, addition of SHMP, DSHP and TSC each reduced ionic calcium, increased ethanol stability and reduced sediment. Following stabiliser additions, there was a good correlation between ethanol stability and ionic calcium (R- 2 = 0. 85) but not between ethanol stability and pH (R- 2 = 0. 08). Overall, reducing ionic calcium reduced the amount of sediment formed for all these three stabilisers, although there was no single trend line between sediment formation and ionic calcium concentration. Sediment formation was not well correlated with pH for TSC or for SHMP, but it was for DSHP, making it the only stabiliser where sediment formation correlated well both with ionic calcium and pH, which might account for its effectiveness at higher ionic calcium levels. Sediment was much reduced when the temperature was reduced from 140 degrees C to 125 degrees C and 114 degrees C. There were no further changes in sediment on storage for two weeks. Analysis of the sediment showed that it was predominantly fat and protein, with a mass ratio ranging between 1. 43 : 1 and 1. 67 : 1. Its mineral content was usually less than 5 % of dry weight. The maximum amounts of P and Ca were found to be 2. 32 % and 1. 63 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the calcium-binding capacity of inorganic and organic ortho- and polyphosphates. This calcium-binding capacity can be used to influence the stability of, for example, casein micelles in dairy systems. Four phosphates were selected: disodium uridine monophosphate (Na 2 UMP, organic <b>orthophosphate),</b> <b>disodium</b> hydrogen phosphate (Na 2 HPO 4, inorganic orthophosphate), sodium phytate (SP, organic polyphosphate), and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP, inorganic polyphosphate). Concentrations of up to 100 mmolL- 1 phosphate were added to a 50 mmolL- 1 CaCl 2 solution. The samples were prepared at pH 8. 0 and were analyzed before and after sterilization for calcium-ion activity, conductivity, pH, sediment, and turbidity. Both SHMP and SP are strong chelators, as calcium ions bind to these phosphates in the ratio of 3 : 1 and 6 : 1, respectively. Calcium ions also strongly bind to Na 2 HPO 4, but in a ratio of 3 : 2 with insoluble Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 complexes as result. The equilibrium position of Na 2 UMP is not strong towards the chelated complex, and significant levels of free calcium and free phosphate can exist. An equilibrium constant of Lmol- 1 was determined for calcium uridine monophosphate (CaUMP) complexes. Both calculation of the equilibrium constant and analysis on the CaUMP precipitate confirmed a reactivity of 1 : 1 between calcium and Na 2 UMP. The CaUMP complexes are well soluble at ambient temperature, and insoluble complexes appear after sterilization, because the solubility of CaUMP decreases during heating. Finally, we concluded that the structure of phosphate molecules determines their calcium-binding capacity rather than organic or inorganic origin of phosphate...|$|R
40|$|MastersThis {{thesis is}} devoted to a {{developing}} optimization high-throughput analysis of certain drugs namely HIE- 124, its major metabolite and telithromycin, using monolithic silica HPLC column. The developed methods were applied for the determination of these drugs in standard solution, rat serum, mice serum, mice urine and in pharmaceutical formulations. The principle of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters was studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The different experimental parameters that affected the development and the stability of telithromycin were studied. The results were statistically analyzed. The thesis is divided into four main parts: Part I: This part presents a general introduction about high performance liquid chromatography, the main types of HPLC techniques and instrumentation. It includes an introduction about high-throughput analysis as a methodology for the rapid analysis of large numbers of compounds. It also includes an overview about the monolithic column for fast HPLC separations and chromatographic properties of monolithic columns. Part II: A fast, simple and precise high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated for the determination of telithromycin in rat serum and pharmaceutical formulations. Chromatographic resolution of the analyte with internal standard (propranolol) was performed on a Chromolith Speed Rod monolithic silica column (100 mm × 4. 6 mm i. d.) under isocratic conditions using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrilee- methanol- 30 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6. 5) (30 : 10 : 60, v/v/v) at flow rate of 2. 0 mL/min. The elution of the analytes was detected at excitation/emission wavelength 273 / 485 nm. The total run time of the assay was 2. 5 min. The described method was linear over the range of 10 - 500 ng/mL (r = 0. 999). The LOD was found 2 ng/mL. The mean extraction efficiency from serum for telithromycin was within the range 90 - 96 % at 10 - 500 ng/mL. The overall recoveries of telithromycin from pharmaceutical formulations were in the ranges 97. 7 - 100. 1 % with % RSD ranged from 1. 06 - 1. 20 %. Part III: In this part, a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatographic (LC) assay was developed for the simultaneous determination of new ultra-short acting hypnotic “HIE- 124 ” in biological fluids and its metabolite in aqueous solutions. Serum and urine samples were extracted using dichloromethane. HPLC system included a ChromolithTM Performance RP- 18 e 100 mm× 4. 6 mm column, using acetonitrile: 20 mM <b>disodium</b> hydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> anhydrous, (35 : 65, v/v) adjusted to pH 7. UV detector (λ = 240 nm) was used. The calibration curves were linear within the concentration range of 60 – 2000 ng/mL for HIE- 124 and 200 – 1600 ng/mL for the metabolite (r > 0. 995 for HIE- 124 and > 0. 978 for its metabolite). The lower limit of detection was found 20 ng/mL and 65 ng/mL for HIE- 124 and its metabolite, respectively.
