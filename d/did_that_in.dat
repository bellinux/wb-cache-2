2500|$|On 9 August 2009, {{speaking}} {{at the opening of}} his weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu promised not to repeat the [...] "mistake" [...] of the Gaza unilateral pullout, saying, [...] "We will not repeat this mistake. We will not create new evacuees", and adding that [...] "the unilateral evacuation brought neither peace nor security. On the contrary", and that [...] "We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [...] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking". He also said, [...] "Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state". In October 2014, Netanyahu said [...] "We don't just hand over territory, close our eyes and hope for the best. We <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Lebanon and we got thousands of rockets. We <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Gaza, we got Hamas and 15,000 rockets. So we're not gonna just replicate that. We want to see genuine recognition of the Jewish state and rock solid security arrangements on the ground. That's the position I've held, and it's only become firmer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Allen – British {{publisher}} of Nexus, who said {{photographs of the}} lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and [...] "Getting to the Moon really isn't {{much of a problem}} – the Russians <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1959. The big problem is getting people there." [...] He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because radiation levels in outer space would be deadly. Another variant on this is the idea that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the Apollo 1 fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with Apollos 14 or 15 being the first real mission.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip {{down on the side}} of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E

2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson's {{departure}} {{had previously been}} rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told TV Guide that he [...] "went to (the GH powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E

6000|$|Gentlemen of {{the secular}} press dealt with the Rev. Mr. Sheldon not {{altogether}} fairly. To some very relevant considerations they gave no weight.

Complacently surveying the wreck and ruin that he has wrought, even that great anarch, the [...] "well meaning person," [...] can not have entire assurance that he meant as well as the disastrous results appear to him to show.|$|E

But no! He looked so bright and gentle: he must feel, as she <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this eagerness of blind age there was piteousness enough to call forth inexhaustible patience. How much more strongly he would feel this if he knew about her brother!

60|$|As {{everything}} was alive in 1798, the Crisis {{was ready to}} sail in three days after I joined her. We hauled into the North river, as became the dignity of our voyage, and got our crew on board. On the whole, we mustered a pretty good body of men, ten of them being green; fellows who {{had never seen the}} ocean, but who were young, healthy and athletic, and who promised to be useful before a great while. Including those aft, we counted thirty-eight souls on board. The ship was got ready in hopes of being able to sail of a Thursday, for Captain Williams was a thoughtful man, and was anxious to get the ship fairly at sea, with the first work done, previously to the next Sabbath. Some small matters, however, could not be got through with in time; and, as for sailing of a Friday, that was out of the question. No one <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1798, who could help it. This gave us a holiday, and I got leave to pass the afternoon and evening ashore.|$|E
60|$|Henry Crawford was in {{the first}} glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey; {{and not being able to}} catch Edmund's ear, was {{detailing}} it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His scheme was to rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though that consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> spite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material inconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time, a little homestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year might be spent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and perfecting that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was increasing in value to him every day. Sir Thomas heard and was not offended. There was no want of respect in the young man's address; and Fanny's reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm and uninviting, that he had nothing to censure in her. She said little, assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of appropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of strengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom he was observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.|$|E
