5|$|Another {{important}} {{development was}} in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> and the importance of mathematics, while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} {{that there may be}} a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> for even a sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide <b>empirical</b> <b>evidences</b> of {{compensating}} wage differentials for Brazilian manufacturing firms. This theory states that higher injury risk firms would pay higher wages in order to attract workers – it implies a tradeoff between wages and job amenities. The <b>empirical</b> <b>evidences</b> of this paper are similar to stylized facts of the literature: omitted variables bias provides underestimated values for the injury risks coefficient, but after controlling the unobserved heterogeneity of workers the coefficient becomes positive and significant. In addition, this paper provides estimations from alternative models like instrumental variables and firms fixed effects.

5|$|Later Greek philosophers, {{observing the}} motions of the heavenly bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence.</b> The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence.</b> When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. <b>Empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. <b>Empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by <b>empirical</b> <b>evidence</b> that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics.
