5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> but did not clearly rely on the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy</b> Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The second round, <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!,</b> {{features}} six new {{categories of}} clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round (except in Super Jeopardy!, where <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> values ranged from 500 to 2,500 points). The contestant {{with the least}} amount of money {{at the end of the}} Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!; if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern selects first.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how defamilisation and familisation measures can affect women’s capacity to accumulate pension income and their subsequent {{standard of living}} after retirement. Firstly, it highlights the concepts of defamilisation and familisation and discusses the potential of these measures in assisting women to save pension income through the ‘commodification of labour’ and the ‘decommodification of labour’. Secondly, it examines the major pension policies and examples of defamilisation and familisation measures in Taiwan. It shows how the current limited provision of such measures could create a ‘double jeopardy’ for women, affecting access to paid employment or resources to enable women who wish to undertake caring responsibilities to do so, and ultimately impacting their capacity to accumulate pension income. Thirdly, it suggests ways to strengthen defamilisation and familisation measures in order to enable women to accumulate sufficient retirement income {{on the basis of}} three preconditions. These are: policy attention to the reciprocal relationship between familisation measures/defamilisation measures and pension schemes for women; a recognition of differences among women in their preferred strategies to accumulate pension income; and an emphasis on a life course perspective to understand the <b>double</b> <b>jeopardies</b> faced by women in saving for retirement. ...|$|R
5000|$|Also in {{the first}} two rounds, one decade in one {{category}} hid a special question called the [...] "Time Capsule". The first player to choose that got a chance to answer the question unopposed for double value. A correct answer on that question added those points to his/her score, with no penalization if the player missed. A right answer also won a special memorabilia-type prize like a replica of KITT from Knight Rider, The Brady Bunch lunch box, or a Charlie's Angels board game. This was similar to the Daily <b>Double</b> on <b>Jeopardy!.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Crossword Extra was a bonus word played once in Round 1 {{and twice}} in {{subsequent}} rounds (originally once in each round, {{with the second}} word added following {{the removal of the}} Getaways). Similar to the Daily <b>Double</b> in <b>Jeopardy!,</b> the Extra clue was revealed upon correctly guessing another word. The contestant then wagered all or part of his/her score (or up to $500, $1,000, or $2,000—depending on the round—if he/she had less than those amounts). A correct answer added the wager, while an incorrect answer deducted it.|$|R
5|$|In two appeals {{from state}} courts, the Taney Court considered, and rejected, <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> claims {{arising from the}} {{hypothetical}} prospect of prosecution by {{the federal and state}} governments for the same conduct.|$|E
5|$|Watson took a {{commanding}} lead in <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!,</b> correctly responding to both Daily Doubles. Watson {{responded to the}} second Daily Double correctly with a 32% confidence score.|$|E
5|$|Contestants who finish <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{unofficial}} Jeopardy! fansite {{known as the}} [...] "J! Archive" [...] (...) , which transcribes games from throughout Jeopardy!s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by Jeopardy!-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a [...] "wagering calculator" [...] that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called [...] "Coryat scoring" [...] that disregards wagering during Daily <b>Doubles</b> or Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> and gauges one's general strength at the game. The site's main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, a student from Cleveland, Ohio, who himself appeared as a Jeopardy! contestant in March 2010. Before J! Archive, there was an earlier Jeopardy! fansite known as the [...] "Jeoparchive", created by season 19 contestant Ronnie O'Rourke, who managed and updated the site until Jennings's run made her disillusioned with the show.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} the effects of functional limitations on changes in levels of depression over time. A multiple-hierarchy stratification perspective framed the analyses of potential stratification-based contingencies of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Methods. We derived data from a longitudinal study of adults aged 65 and older in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area over a 3 -year period (2001 – 2003). We used ordinary least squares regression models in order to assess the focal associations across a set of social status interaction terms. Results. Changes in functional limitations were associated with changes in depression, but the patterns depended on interactions among race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Discussion. These observations contribute to research by blending ideas from <b>double</b> and triple <b>jeopardy</b> and dif-ferential vulnerability perspectives. Although analyses of multiple contingencies create analytical challenges, this complexity is needed to accurately specify the mental health effects of functional limitations. T HE stress process perspective identifies limitations in activ-ities of daily living as among the most pernicious stress-ors in late life (Pearlin & Skaff, 1996). Levels of functional limitations are higher among older age groups (Long & Pavalko, 2004) and are associated positively with depressio...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Educational Insights {{released}} {{an updated version}} of the Classroom Jeopardy! system. The updated system featured a restyling of the console and remotes, dry-erase Final Jeopardy! boards, and a host remote with LCD [...] "correct response" [...] display. Additional functions included the ability to enter players' names into the console, and more varied wagers for Daily <b>Doubles</b> and Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> Additionally, this system used USB Flash Drives in place of the cartridges to program the console (the system included a 512K Flash Drive, but other larger Flash Drives could also be used). This also makes the updated system capable of using audiovisual clues (such as audio and video clips, music cues, and still images), properly-formatted math equation clues, and foreign [...] "romance language" [...] characters. The new system is not backward-compatible with the older cartridges and accessories, but games written with the older system's software can be easily converted via the new system's [...] "Clue Studio" [...] program. The entirety of the new system also fits into an included storage suitcase, allowing for easier transport of the unit. Both editions of the game are still available through the company's website, although the older system's price has dropped substantially.|$|R
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In Grady v. Corbin (1990), the Court held that a <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> violation could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied, but Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon (1993).|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that {{advances}} {{will be based on}} the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examined intrinsic and extrinsic {{factors which}} delay or deter African American elderly from utilizing formal community based long term care services. The intrinsic factors studied included income, housing, educational level, gender, cultural influence, service knowledge, functional ability and informal support systems. Extrinsic factors included service system structures, staffing composition, the make-up of advisory boards and boards of directors, program policies and procedures. The five questions and six hypotheses examined individual, structural and cultural determinants and {{their influence on}} the use of community based long term care services. ^ This descriptive study measured similarities and differences between two groups of African American elderly. The study was conducted in an Area Agency on Aging with two sets of African American elderly aged 70 and older: one set of fifty (50) used long term care services funded by the agency (between July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994), and the other fifty (50) did not. All one hundred (100) participants were asked questions from a standard instrument called the Options Assessment Form and the Black Identity Scale. A fifteen (15) page questionnaire was sent to all fifty-two (52) Area Agencies on Aging in the State of Pennsylvania. ^ The study indicates that African American elderly are more likely to use programs and services provided through the Area Agency on Aging if there is significant representation of African Americans in management/administrative staff positions or as part of advisory councils or boards of directors. Second, research supports the concept of <b>double</b> and multiple <b>jeopardy</b> for older African Americans. Third, the informal support system is the key to whether and when African American elders enter the community based long-term care system. Next, even when the service agency is providing high levels of service to the African American community there may still be barriers that would prevent more from using services. In addition, the level of cultural identity was found to be high in both African American elderly groups studied which has implications for the delivery of service to elders and their families. ...|$|R
5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy</b> Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, Jennings {{was finally able}} to choose a Daily Double clue, while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue {{incorrectly}} {{for the first time in}} the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> Round. After the first round, Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond. Nonetheless, the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of $77,147, besting Jennings who scored $24,000 and Rutter who scored $21,600.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> and {{self-incrimination}} and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain. The amendment {{was the basis for}} the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy</b> Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Lanza {{was one of}} {{a series}} of cases {{involving}} Prohibition. Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in federal district court. He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy</b> Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that the state and federal governments were dual sovereigns, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} a beard and monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy</b> or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2007, Mauffray {{found that}} Bell had {{violated}} {{the terms of}} his probation for previous convictions. The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|Protected against <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! and <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001. On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.|$|E
5|$|Three contestants each {{take their}} place behind a lectern, with the {{returning}} champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!,</b> and Final Jeopardy!. The material for the clues covers {{a wide variety of}} topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes {{before the start of the}} round.|$|E
5|$|It Is the Law is a 1924 American silent mystery film {{directed}} by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Arthur Hohl, Herbert Hayes, and Mona Palma. It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1922 Broadway play by Elmer Rice, itself based on a novel by Hayden Talbot. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert Woodruff (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, Woodruff fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. When Woodruff returns to court Allen under a new identity, she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills Woodruff, and goes free because a conviction would constitute <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E
5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear that Congress has the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> did not attach.|$|E
5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the <b>Double</b> <b>Jeopardy!</b> round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, <b>double</b> <b>jeopardy</b> and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
