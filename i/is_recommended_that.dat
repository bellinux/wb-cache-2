5|$|Aphids, {{mealybugs}} {{and other}} invertebrate pests can spread viruses. Symptoms {{vary with the}} species, but a loss of vigour is usual. Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata.

Caution is exercised in this situation due to the occasional occurrence of respiratory depression, and it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> benzodiazepine overdose treatment facilities should be available.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are not often recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.|$|E
5|$|Growing medium - Free-draining, humus-rich, {{somewhat}} acid {{growing media}} {{are used for}} commercial production, such as a mixture of peat or leafmould and an inert material such as grit, sharp sand or polystyrene beads. It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> plants should be grown in relatively small pots; half-height pots are suitable.|$|E

5|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such that more than two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{looking to}} become {{forensic}} anthropologists first obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology from an accredited university. During their studies they {{should focus on}} physical anthropology as well as osteology. In addition it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> individuals take courses {{in a wide range}} of sciences such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and genetics.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} noted that N. rajah {{produces}} a very extensive root system (for a Nepenthes) and, for this reason, it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also {{eliminates the need for}} frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> deep fryers {{be cleaned}} often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also {{contaminate}} nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> {{the effects of}} warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|Urate-lowering {{measures}} {{should be}} increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360µmol/l (5.0–6.0mg/dl) and continue indefinitely. If these medications are in chronic {{use at the}} time of an attack, it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> they be continued. Levels that cannot be brought below 6.0mg/dl while attacks continue indicates refractory gout.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> fringe or {{minority}} groups should go through formal, mandatory elections {{to choose the}} representatives that will {{provide them with a}} voice in Parliament. Thereafter, they may be called [...] "elected representatives". The Government may assist by providing guidelines for the conduct of proper elections. Furthermore, the maximum number of NMPs – nine – is said to be far too small to ensure proper representation of minority groups. Hence, it has <b>been</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> there should not be any limitation on the number of NMPs.|$|R
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, it <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine {{should be used}} to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> {{those with}} the {{syndrome}} {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
