When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The <b>ink</b> <b>plate</b> is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
60|$|Having {{placed the}} {{enlarged}} prints side by side, {{two or three}} conspicuous and convenient points of reference, whether islands, enclosures, or particularly distinct bifurcations, should be identified and marked. By their help, {{the position of the}} prints should be readjusted, so that they shall be oriented exactly alike. From each point of reference, in succession, the spines of the ridges are then to be followed with a fine pencil, in the two prints alternately, neatly marking each new point of comparison with a numeral in coloured <b>ink</b> (<b>Plate</b> 13). When both of the prints are good and clear, this is rapidly done; wherever the impressions are faulty, there may be many ambiguities requiring patience to unravel. At first I was timid, and proceeded too hesitatingly when one of the impressions was indistinct, making short alternate traces. Afterwards on gaining confidence, I traced boldly, starting from any well-defined point of reference and not stopping until there were reasonable grounds for hesitation, and found it easy in this way to trace the unions between opposite and incompletely printed ends of ridges, and to disentangle many bad impressions.|$|E

50|$|Color {{images are}} often built of several stacked color channels, {{each of them}} {{representing}} value levels of the given channel. For example, RGB images are composed of three independent channels for red, green and blue primary color components; CMYK images have four channels for cyan, magenta, yellow and black <b>ink</b> <b>plates,</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} mechanisation, inking {{was carried out by}} rollers that passed over the face of the type, then moved out of the way onto an <b>ink</b> <b>plate</b> to pick up a fresh film of ink for the next sheet. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper slid against a hinged platen (see image), which then rapidly pressed onto the type and swung back again as the sheet was removed and the next sheet inserted. As the fresh sheet of paper replaced the printed paper, the now freshly-inked rollers ran over the type again. Fully automated 20th-century presses, such as the Kluge and [...] "Original" [...] Heidelberg Platen (the [...] "Windmill"), incorporated pneumatic sheet feed and delivery.|$|E
5000|$|The printer uses an ink {{knife to}} lay out a [...] "pad", mound or streak of ink on a smooth <b>inking</b> <b>plate,</b> {{originally}} made of polished metal or stone. The ink is then rubbed with the brayer until an area is smooth enough to beat with the ink balls or roller. In contemporary printmaking commercially available inks are often smooth and soft enough {{that they do not}} require braying before they can be rolled (and thus a more-fragile glass sheet may be used as an <b>inking</b> <b>plate).</b> The roller is passed systematically across the surface to produce an even layer of ink. The roller is then applied to the forme, block, stone or plate so that the ink is evenly transferred to the raised or receptive areas before the next stage of transferring the ink, by moderate pressure, to the printing surface or offset substrate.|$|R
25|$|The RYB {{model was}} used for colour {{printing}} by Jacob Christoph Le Blon as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta, cyan, yellow and black ink, put onto separate <b>inked</b> <b>plates</b> and then overlaid {{one at a time}} onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.|$|R
50|$|In {{intaglio}} printmaking, {{the artist}} makes {{marks on the}} plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) {{that are capable of}} holding <b>ink.</b> The <b>inked</b> <b>plate</b> is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper. This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.|$|R
50|$|Print process {{simulation}} uses interactive simulation software {{to reproduce the}} operating conditions of complex multi-colour printing presses that often cost several million dollars. Simulators are available for different printing process technologies (Offset Sheetfed, Heatset and Coldset Web Offset; Flexographic and Gravure Packaging), includes their consumables (like <b>inks,</b> <b>plates,</b> paper and other substrates) and where pertinent, in-line packaging operations (such as folding, cutting, label creation).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "direct print" [...] method, the <b>plate</b> is <b>inked,</b> the thin paper (dampened) {{is placed on}} the <b>inked</b> <b>plate</b> and trimmed to size, paste is applied to the thin paper, and the {{ensemble}} (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thinner paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place.|$|R
50|$|Open ink well systems, {{the older}} method of pad {{printing}}, used an ink trough for the ink supply, which was located behind the printing plate. A flood bar pushed {{a pool of}} <b>ink</b> over the <b>plate,</b> and a doctor blade removes the <b>ink</b> from the <b>plate</b> surface, leaving <b>ink</b> on the etched artwork area ready for the pad to pick up.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "pre-pasted" [...] method, the thin paper (dry) is trimmed {{to the size}} of the plate, then paste is applied and allowed to dry. When the {{printmaker}} is ready to print, the paper is dampened to activate the paste and placed, paste-side up, on an <b>inked</b> <b>plate.</b> Then the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet and run through a press as described above. An advantage of the pre-pasted method is that once dried, the paste-applied papers can be stored indefinitely, just like a lick-and-stick postage stamp. A disadvantage of this method is that because the paper is trimmed dry, the artist must take into account how much in each direction the paper will expand when it is dampened prior to printing.|$|R

5000|$|Historically, {{the terms}} {{monotype}} and monoprint were often used interchangeably. More recently, however, {{they have come}} to refer to two different, though similar, types of printmaking. Both involve the transfer of <b>ink</b> from a <b>plate</b> to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotypes, the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features {{on the surface of the}} plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Additionally, the term monotype is often used for an image made by inking a non-absorbent surface with a solid colour, laying over it a piece of paper and drawing onto the back of the paper. When the paper is pulled off the resulting print consists of the line surrounded by ink picked up from the <b>inked</b> <b>plate.</b> The result has a chance element, often random and irregular which gives the print a certain charm, a technique famously used by British artist Tracey Emin, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, where the practice of monoprinting in general was regarded as [...] "fake painting".|$|R
2500|$|Robert Harrild {{established}} the company Harrild & Sons Limited in 1809 in Farringdon, London. The company used to manufacture printing presses for letterpress printing. The company started manufacturing presses with ink balls (since the printing presses then used ink balls rather than composition rollers to <b>ink</b> the <b>plates).</b> In 1813, Harrild joined the discussion within the London printing community {{and talked about}} use of [...] "composition rollers" [...] instead of [...] "ink balls" [...] to <b>ink</b> the printing <b>plates.</b> The majority of hand printers preferred use of ink balls over composition rollers but after successful demonstration of Harrilds composition roller, every printer in London started using the composition roller. To manufacture the rollers, Harrild established another company at 25 Farringdon Street in London. Harrild & Sons eventually started manufacturing all kinds of printing equipment.|$|R
50|$|Baxter's {{process for}} {{producing}} colour prints combined relief and intaglio printing methods. A 'key' plate was prepared, usually {{made of steel}} and using any combination of engraving, stipple, etching and aquatint. Baxter also appears to have used mezzotint and lithography to create his key plate on occasion. The key plate provided the main lines of the image {{and much of the}} tone, light and shade. It was usually printed in a neutral tone, such as light grey or terracotta. Often Baxter used more than one colour to <b>ink</b> the key <b>plate</b> - for example, to gradate the image from blue in the sky, to buff in the middle distance and to a darker colour in the foreground; i.e. <b>inking</b> the <b>plate</b> à la poupée. Usually Baxter used aquatint for landscapes and stipple to work faces and figures.|$|R

50|$|Another tonal technique, mezzotint, {{begins with}} a plate surface that is evenly {{indented}} {{so that it will}} carry a fairly dark tone of <b>ink.</b> The mezzotint <b>plate</b> is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade. Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker. Occasionally these two techniques are combined.|$|R

50|$|See above: Anilox rolls are {{properly}} specified by cell volume for the required print application.Lower volumes = thinner ink films {{for the highest}} quality process printing.Higher volumes address combination, screens, line work, solid coverage and coating applications.In virtually all printing applications with various print requirements, one volume will not print all to the highest quality. Limited print stations generally call for a compromise between the highest quality graphics and color.There are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements, such as; substrate, <b>ink</b> system, <b>plate</b> material, plate mounting tape, press speed, drying capacity,...., etc.Best course of action is to consult suppliers of all these components for proper engraving specifications from their experience.|$|R

There are various materials, like <b>ink,</b> paper, <b>plate,</b> solvents and photographic film, are being used in offset printing machine. By the use of 3 R technique that is reduce, reuse and recycle any organization can save money as well as environment. In this research work some eco-friendly techniques are suggested which can reduce the impact on environment at its minimum level.

50|$|Around 1923 he {{developed}} a new technique that eliminated the problem of printing a mirror image. He drew on smooth paper with the special ink, then laid the paper over the plate and ran it through the press to transfer the <b>ink</b> to the <b>plate.</b> He offset the drawing, powdered the plate with zinc oxide or whiting and coated the plate with a very thin layer of varnish. When treated with acid the effect was to create crayon-like lines.|$|R
