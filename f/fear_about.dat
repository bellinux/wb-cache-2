5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E

5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, Aboriginal {{women are}} {{more than five times}} more likely to die from {{cervical}} cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests. There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> the procedure. Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained pap smear providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.|$|E
25|$|Beginning of the End made Bert I. Gordon {{famous for}} his giant monster films. Critics and film historians {{point out that the}} film {{is only one of many}} which drew heavily on most Americans' <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the {{possibility}} of nuclear war. However, Beginning of the End had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as Godzilla or Them! A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).|$|E

We examined the social and built environment correlates of parents&# 039;: (1) <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> strangers harming their child; and (2) perceptions of the likelihood this would actually happen. We also tested whether associations differed by area socio-economic status (SES) as parents in low income neighbourhoods, typically with more crime, may hold greater fears for their children&# 039;s safety. Results suggest that regardless of SES, neighbourhood features that encouraged pedestrians, whilst minimising vehicle traffic, were most conducive to parents perceiving a safer neighbourhood. The natural surveillance generated by a more walkable neighbourhood may help alleviate parents&# 039; <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> strangers...|$|R

The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs of the disease and the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E
25|$|ELINT {{operations}} {{aimed at}} China: After China tested its first nuclear weapons on 16 October 1964, at Lop Nur, Xinjiang, India and the USA {{shared a common}} <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> the nuclear capabilities of China. Owing to the extreme remoteness of Chinese testing grounds, strict secrecy surrounding the Chinese nuclear programme, and the extreme difficulty that an Indian or American would have passing themselves off as Chinese, {{it was almost impossible}} to carry out any HUMINT operation. So, the CIA in the late 1960s decided to launch an ELINT operation along with RAW and ARC to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to Nanda Devi involved celebrated Indian climber M S Kohli who along with operatives of Special Frontier Force and the CIA – most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran STOL pilot – was to place a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China. The monitoring device was near successfully implanted on Nanda Devi, when an avalanche forced a hasty withdrawal. Later, a subsequent mountain operation to retrieve or replant the device was aborted when {{it was found that the}} device was lost. Recent reports indicate that radiation traces from this device have been discovered in sediment below the mountain. However, the actual data is not conclusive.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> drug treatment among 300 young male heroin abusers in Hong Kong (172 newcomers and 128 repeaters) recruited from non-government treatment agencies. An indigenous 35 -item <b>Fears</b> <b>about</b> Treatment Scale (<b>Fears</b> Scale) {{was developed to}} measure <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> treatment among the participants. Results showed that four factors (fear of failure, fear of labeling or disclosure, fear of maladaptation and fear of withdrawal) were abstracted from the scale. Reliability analyses showed that subscales based on these four factors and the total scale were internally consistent. The findings showed that treatment failure was the major fear in the respondents. The present findings suggest that drug treatment and rehabilitation services should help clients, particularly young substance abusers, mitigate their treatment fears.

Lynn believes Hemingway likely was terrified Hadley would not survive the birth, and he became [...] "beside himself with <b>fear...</b> <b>about</b> the extent of her suffering and swamped by a sense of helplessness at the realization that he would probably arrive too late to be of assistance to her".

[...] The Globe and Mail reviewer Brad Wheeler said that Drake was [...] "rewriting the rules" [...] by including no choruses, and called Shebib and Drake's work on the track [...] "bodacious". David Berry of the National Post called [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] the best song on Nothing Was the Same, praising Drake’s smart wordplay and Shebib [...] "going Picasso" [...] on a Whitney Houston sample. Writing for Idolator, Bianca Gracie said the song showed a more confident Drake, noting that he channels Jay-Z with [...] "bold lyrics" [...] and a [...] "dizzying production" [...] reminiscent of Kanye West circa 2004. Robert Copsy of Digital Spy also noted a significant growth in confidence, and called the song: [...] "a piece of atmospheric self-reflection that sets up his current mindset: an artist with plenty of ambition but with a constant nagging <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> losing his way." ...|$|E

[...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating <b>fear</b> <b>about</b> how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] She says she has come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he was wrong about her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster.

40|$|This major {{research}} paper (MRP) provides {{a strong case}} for dismissing the overblown rhetoric of nuclear alarmism by demonstrating that a multitude of constructive actions are being taken in order to mitigate what is a substantially small threat. By effectively evaluating the arguments for alarmism and responding to them in turn, this MRP asserts that the assumptions from which stem the contemporary overblown rhetoric on nuclear terrorism are not grounded. <b>Fears</b> <b>about</b> terrorists operating independently to acquire nuclear materials, <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> the safety of nuclear installations and radiological sources as well as <b>fears</b> <b>about</b> state-sponsored nuclear terrorism are assuaged through a reasoned deconstruction of arguments. Furthermore, this MRP argues that multilateral nuclear security initiatives are an essential component of global counter-nuclear terrorism efforts, given that there are numerous unilateral, bilateral and multilateral initiatives that exist explicitly for the prevention of nuclear weapon proliferation within the arsenals of terrorists...|$|R
