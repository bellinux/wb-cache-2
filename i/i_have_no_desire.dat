25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to tell other people their business".|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
60|$|I {{believed}} afresh in universal philanthropy. The sweet lethargic {{days were}} satisfying; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to analyze the}} motives of my associates.|$|R
60|$|As, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to {{purchase}} this place of entertainment, the exorbitant value set on it by its proprietors {{did not affect}} my spirits.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{early spring}} of 1871 he skipped as I heard {{afterward}} to Canada ... Left me without means of support. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to live with}} a criminal." ...|$|R
2500|$|Baldwin's {{vice presidential}} run, and Peroutka's {{withdrawal}} from the national Constitution Party, led to active 2006 speculation that Baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008. Baldwin responded in October that [...] "I have learned to never say never, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to run. [...] would require several 'miraculous' signs of reassurance that, frankly, I cannot see happening. However, I am always open to God's will." [...] He repeated this stance through March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|According to Roger Ebert {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{the film was}} met with two extremes, one side being overall positive, while the other side being the exact opposite. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who was also in attendance, said in a 1992 interview, [...] "After I saw Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me at Cannes, David Lynch had {{disappeared}} so far up his own ass that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different. And you know, I loved him. I loved him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's {{hard for me to}} stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to argue}} further within {{hearing of the}} commodore, and {{scrambled}} down into the boat, where my comrades were seated ready to begin the voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll go as escort. The {{doctor has}} been wanting {{me to leave}} for a week, and now <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to stay," [...] he said eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought, as Mr. Stanner {{understood}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{for his company}} elsewhere, he would hardly venture to intrude upon me in my house, and certainly not after--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure. Also Joseph Milne of FPSguru.com featured the game on his list of [...] "Top 5 underrated games" [...] at number 4 on the list.|$|E
6000|$|... "My purpose carries me {{no farther}} than Marmaduke Lodge. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to see any}} one to-day besides Miss Thoroughbung." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to conceal}} from this nearest and dearest friend and {{relative}} the real cause of my appearance, and I laid before {{her all the}} facts concerning Sylvia and myself.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, Ralph Ellison made {{reference}} to Samson in his novel Invisible Man saying, [...] "Whoever else I was, I was <b>no</b> Samson. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to destroy myself even if it destroyed the machine; I wanted freedom, not destruction." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> for food, and doubtless my comrades {{felt much}} the same; but yet we ate because {{of having been}} told so to do, and forced the meat down our throats when {{it was like to}} choke us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to be spilled {{overboard}}. I went overboard once, {{and that}} was quite enough," [...] answered the young actress.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hesitated, Mrs. Moor, because I have {{sometimes}} heard young wives complain that their husbands' friends were marplots, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to be one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{need to tell}} you," [...] replied Ned, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to lead an idle life. But, uncle, I {{think your}} terms are very high." ...|$|E
60|$|Again was I {{suddenly}} recalled to {{my immediate}} surroundings by {{a repetition of}} the weird moan {{from the depths of}} the cave. Naked and unarmed as <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to face the unseen thing which menaced me.|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{the wealth}} of that day's sunlight, the opulence of those nearby fields--the beauty of those warmly-misted hills! In the evening, as I mounted Ladrone and rode him down the lane, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to share Burton's perilous journey down the Hotalinqua.|$|R
60|$|In {{my secret}} heart I {{believed}} that he was taking much too lofty {{a view of the}} matter; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to argue against so flattering a delusion, if it were one, and only wished that I could share it with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{for mother}} {{to decide on}} what terms we are to stand, Janet, and strange as all this has been, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to be at enmity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to mix in," [...] {{said the}} good-natured giraffe. [...] "I never take sides in {{terrestrial}} strife. Still, {{as that is}} my foot, I think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This conversation," [...] I interposed, [...] "seems {{to me to}} be {{beside the}} point. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to be of service to you. My inclinations are rather the other way." ...|$|E
60|$|The scene {{immediately}} before us was so revolting that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> {{to gaze at}} it longer, {{and there was a}} certain sense of relief in my mind when the sergeant, prompted by me, had thus decided upon a definite course of action.|$|R
60|$|Elias {{called after}} us imploringly {{as we went}} out of the hold; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to remain longer with the cur, and we put on the hatch in order that, if he did succeed in freeing himself of the bonds, he would yet be imprisoned.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{seen him}} through one little affair {{connected}} with an idol {{that had brought}} me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to help him through further experiences. He was a man to whom unpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} polite," [...] said Emily laughing, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to deprive Mrs. Haughton of a {{companion}} {{she has made}} out so well with these twenty years past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} you," [...] her companion answered dryly. [...] "If {{you mean that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to encourage promiscuous acquaintances, you are certainly right. I prefer to be dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Humph! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to {{mix with}} chance-met wastrels. My ears are not long. I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.' The Jat slid himself heavily into a far corner.|$|E
60|$|Marriage, paternity, householding, {{during these}} years unquestionably {{put the brakes on}} my work as a writer, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to return to bachelorhood.

6000|$|... "Be not so warm, cousin," [...] {{said the}} King, smiling, and {{speaking}} under his breath; [...] "when I wished {{for the head}} constable, {{as a means of}} ending the settlement of our trifling differences, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> for his body, which might remain at Saint Quentin's with much convenience." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that my lodging that night {{was the subject of}} this conversation, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> to {{interfere}} with the good intentions of my hostess.
