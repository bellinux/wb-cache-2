500|$|On 24 June 2017 reggae group Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30, with BBC Four {{scheduled}} to show highlights from their set. When {{they did not}} show it was suspected they missed their time slot, and BBC broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologized on their behalf stating, [...] "If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, we all were – <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were on Jamaican time or something because they didn't {{make it to the}} site on time." [...] The group credited with coining the term [...] "reggae" [...] in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.|$|E
500|$|Staci Krause of IGN {{had mixed}} {{perspectives}} on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines {{to the introduction of}} disappointing medical cases. She described the story line involving Yang and Burke's silent relationship as [...] "finally showing resolution, taking pleasure to the next level", adding: [...] "It was shocking to see Cristina be the one to break, but even more shocking was Burke's two-word response: marry me. I'm really not sure why Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in it for the long haul. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out." [...] Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as [...] "a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E
