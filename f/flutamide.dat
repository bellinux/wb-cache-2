25|$|Bicalutamide is an arylpropionamide analog, seen {{in figure}} 6. It has {{replaced}} <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. Bicalutamide is not as hepatotoxic as <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. Bicalutamide shares the amide bond structure with <b>flutamide.</b> Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of bicalutamide in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flutamide,</b> another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both cyproterone acetate and <b>flutamide</b> have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with <b>flutamide</b> and has resulted in cyproterone acetate never being approved in the United States. Bicalutamide is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to <b>flutamide,</b> but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat hirsutism with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for antiandrogen therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as generics. As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported antiandrogen option in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition {{of complex}} I has {{been implicated in}} {{hepatotoxicity}} associated {{with a variety of}} drugs, for instance <b>flutamide</b> and nefazodone.|$|E
25|$|Androgen {{regulation}} {{decreases the}} likelihood of depression in males. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with <b>flutamide</b> developed more depression-like symptoms compared to control rats.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens are {{medications}} such as <b>flutamide,</b> nilutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and cyproterone acetate {{that directly}} block {{the actions of}} testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{injections}} of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) {{were applied to}} males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, {{but not in the}} TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, <b>flutamide,</b> an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while <b>flutamide</b> inhibited these cells.|$|E
25|$|However, hydroxyflutamide {{worked as}} an {{antagonist}} for W741 mutant ARs. This concurs with the theory that <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide antagonize AR through the mechanism of “passive antagonism”, as they are of a more modest size then bicalutamide. These drugs may therefore be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory prostate cancer previously treated with bicalutamide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flutamide</b> {{became the}} first NSAA to be tested clinically. Later the NSAAs {{bicalutamide}} and nilutamide were developed. The alleged advantages of these compounds were {{that they did not}} affect libido or potency like the other centrally acting compounds under development, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and cyproterone acetate. But this theory did not prove to be true. These NSAAs eventually crossed the blood–brain barrier, like cyproterone acetate, leading to a subsequent increase in serum testosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like <b>flutamide</b> and {{bicalutamide}} are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} some newer {{approaches}} to optimizing growth have been researched and {{are beginning to}} be used. It is possible to reduce the effects of androgens on the body by blocking the receptors with an antiandrogen such as <b>flutamide</b> and by reducing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion is mediated by aromatase and can be inhibited by aromatase blockers such as testolactone. Blocking the effects and conversions of estrogens will allow use of lower doses of glucocorticoids with less risk of acceleration of bone maturation. Other proposed interventions have included bilateral adrenalectomy to remove the androgen sources, or growth hormone treatment to enhance growth.|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of <b>flutamide,</b> as seen {{in figure}} 5. Nilutamide is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{available}} {{options for}} antiandrogen therapy. Spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and <b>flutamide</b> {{are some of}} the most well-known and widely used drugs. Compared to cyproterone acetate, spironolactone is considerably less potent as an antiandrogen by weight and binding affinity. However, despite this, at the doses of which they are typically used, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate have been found to be generally about equivalent in terms of effectiveness for a variety of androgen-related conditions, though, cyproterone acetate has shown a slight though non-statistically-significant advantage in some studies. Also, it has been suggested that cyproterone acetate could be more effective in cases where androgen levels are more pronounced, though this has not been proven.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, <b>flutamide,</b> bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include <b>flutamide,</b> and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in hirsutism. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and dutasteride) may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
25|$|In accordance, a {{study found}} that in women treated with a GnRH analogue, {{spironolactone}} therapy almost completely prevented the bone loss {{that is associated with}} these drugs, whereas treatment with the selective AR antagonist <b>flutamide</b> had no such effect. Other studies have also found an inverse relationship between spironolactone and decreased bone mineral density and bone fractures in men. Estrogens are well known for maintaining and having positive effects on bone, and {{it has been suggested that}} the estrogenic activity of spironolactone may be involved in its positive effects on bone mineral density. However, it should also be noted that high levels of aldosterone have been associated with adverse bone changes, and so the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone might partially or fully be responsible for these effects as a potential alternative explanation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flutamide</b> is an arylpropionamide analog {{with pure}} antiandrogenic properties, {{seen in figure}} 4. It is {{completely}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first pass metabolism to its active form, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and hydrolysis product, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitroaniline. Hydroxyflutamide is a more potent AR antagonist than <b>flutamide</b> in vivo, with higher binding affinity for the AR. Hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of about 8 hours in humans. Hydrolysis of the amide bond represents the major metabolic pathway for this active metabolite. By reversing the stimulatory effect of DHT on ventral prostate weight, <b>flutamide</b> is approximately 2-fold more potent than cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide has relatively low binding affinity to AR and is therefore generally used at [...] high doses {{in order to achieve}} complete AR blockage in therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, <b>flutamide,</b> idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{became evident}} that {{androgen}} ablation alone was insuffient to cure patients with advanced prostate cancer. In the late 1960s, the androgen receptor (AR) was discovered and characterized. Screening of chemical libraries for AR blockers {{led to the}} discovery of the first antiandrogen, cyproterone. An acetate group was then added to cyproterone and created cyproterone acetate. In the 1970s, the antiandrogen <b>flutamide</b> was discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Nonsteroidal antiandrogens (NSAAs) used in HRT for {{transgender}} women include <b>flutamide,</b> nilutamide, and bicalutamide, {{all three}} of which are primarily used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer in cisgender men. Unlike steroidal antiandrogens such as spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, these drugs are pure androgen receptor antagonists. They do not lower androgen levels; rather, they act solely by preventing the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. However, they do so very strongly, and are highly effective antiandrogens. Bicalutamide has improved tolerability and safety profiles relative to cyproterone acetate, as well as to <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide, and has largely replaced the latter two in clinical practice for this reason. Enzalutamide is a more recently introduced NSAA with even greater potency and efficacy as an antiandrogen than bicalutamide, but it is still under patent protection and in relation to this is currently (and for the foreseeable future) [...] extremely expensive. Moreover, enzalutamide has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor and has been associated with central side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and, most notably, seizures (in ≈1% of patients), properties that it does not share with bicalutamide.|$|E
2500|$|Bicalutamide has a cyano {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a nitro group like <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. Bicalutamide has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flutamide</b> {{acts as a}} selective, competitive, silent {{antagonist}} of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR). Its active metabolite, 2-hydroxyflutamide, has between 10- to 25-fold higher affinity for the AR than does <b>flutamide,</b> and hence is a more powerful antiandrogen in comparison. However, at high concentrations, unlike <b>flutamide,</b> 2-hydroxyflutamide is able to weakly activate the AR. <b>Flutamide</b> has far lower affinity for the AR than do steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, {{and it is a}} relatively weak antiandrogen in terms of potency by weight, but the large dosages at which <b>flutamide</b> is used appear to compensate for this. In accordance with its selectivity for the AR, <b>flutamide</b> possesses no progestogenic, (direct) estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antigonadotropic activity. Similarly to nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, <b>flutamide</b> crosses the blood-brain-barrier and exerts central antiandrogen actions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flutamide</b> is metabolized by CYP1A2 (via α-hydroxylation) in {{the liver}} during first-pass {{metabolism}} to its main active form, 2-hydroxyflutamide (which accounts for 23% of an oral dose of <b>flutamide</b> one hour post-ingestion), and to at least five other minor metabolites. Levels of 2-hydroxyflutamide are 50-fold {{higher than those of}} <b>flutamide</b> at steady-state. <b>Flutamide</b> is excreted in various forms in the urine, the primary form being 2-amino-5-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{exceptional}} case {{of extreme}} gynecomastia in a 63-year-old man, {{treated with the}} nonsteroidal antiandrogen <b>flutamide</b> for prostate cancer. (a) With flutamide; (b) after discontinuation of <b>flutamide.</b> More than 90% of cases of gynecomastia with nonsteroidal antiandrogens including <b>flutamide</b> are mild to moderate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} binding to the , the active (R)-enantiomer of {{bicalutamide}} has 4-fold greater affinity relative {{to that of}} hydroxyflutamide, the active metabolite of <b>flutamide</b> (a prodrug), and 5-fold higher affinity relative to that of nilutamide. In addition, bicalutamide possesses the longest half-life of the three drugs, with half-lives of 6-10 days for bicalutamide, 5-6 hours for <b>flutamide</b> and 8-9 hours for hydroxyflutamide, and 23-87 hours (mean 56 hours) for nilutamide. Due to the relatively short half-lives of <b>flutamide</b> and hydroxyflutamide, <b>flutamide</b> must be taken three times daily at 8-hour intervals, whereas bicalutamide and nilutamide may be taken once daily. For this reason, dosing of bicalutamide (and nilutamide) is more convenient than with <b>flutamide.</b> The greater [...] affinity and longer half-life of bicalutamide {{allow it to be}} used at relatively low dosages in comparison to <b>flutamide</b> (750-1500 mg/day) and nilutamide (150-300 mg/day) in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|Although rare, <b>flutamide</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatotoxicity and death. By 1996, 46 cases of severe cholestatic hepatitis had been reported, with 20 fatalities. There have been continued case reports since, including liver transplants and death. Based on the number of prescriptions written, the rate of serious hepatotoxicity associated with <b>flutamide</b> treatment is estimated to be 3 per 10,000. However, other researchers have suggested that the incidence of significant hepatotoxicity may be as high as 6-9%. Another source reported a rate of 0.36%. <b>Flutamide</b> is also associated with liver enzyme elevations in 42-62% of patients. The risk of hepatotoxicity with <b>flutamide</b> treatment is far higher than with nilutamide or bicalutamide. Lower dosages of the drug appear to have a reduced but still significant risk. Liver function should be monitored regularly with liver function tests during <b>flutamide</b> treatment. In addition, due to the high risk of serious hepatotoxicity, <b>flutamide</b> should not be used {{in the absence of a}} serious indication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core side}} effects of [...] such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes occur at similar rates with the {{different}} drugs. Conversely, bicalutamide {{is associated with a}} significantly lower rate of diarrhea compared to <b>flutamide.</b> In fact, the incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the bicalutamide and placebo groups (6.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively) in the [...] trial, whereas diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with <b>flutamide.</b> The rate of nausea and vomiting appears to be lower with bicalutamide and <b>flutamide</b> than with nilutamide (approximately 30% incidence of nausea with nilutamide, usually rated as mild-to-moderate). In addition, bicalutamide (and <b>flutamide)</b> is not associated with alcohol intolerance, visual disturbances, or a high rate of interstitial pneumonitis. In terms of toxicity and rare reactions, as described above, bicalutamide appears to have the lowest relative risks of hepatotoxicity and interstitial pneumonitis, with respective incidences far below those of <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide. In contrast to <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide, no specific complications have been linked to bicalutamide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flutamide</b> {{has also}} been {{associated}} with interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with <b>flutamide</b> {{was found to be}} 0.04% in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flutamide</b> and 2-hydroxyflutamide {{have been}} found in vitro to inhibit CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), an enzyme which is {{required}} for the biosynthesis of androgens. In accordance, <b>flutamide</b> has been found to slightly but significantly lower androgen levels in GnRH analogue-treated male prostate cancer patients and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. As such, <b>flutamide</b> is a weak inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. However, the clinical significance of this action may be limited when <b>flutamide</b> is given without a GnRH analogue to non-castrated men, as the drug markedly elevates testosterone levels into the high normal male range via prevention of AR activation-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in this context.|$|E
50|$|AA560 is an orally active nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) {{that was}} developed in Japan and was first described in the literature in 1977 but was never marketed. It is an anilide derivative and analogue of the NSAA <b>flutamide,</b> and shows greater in vivo antiandrogenic potency than does <b>flutamide.</b> Similarly to <b>flutamide,</b> AA560 is a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and consequently shows progonadotropic effects by increasing levels of gonadotropins and testosterone via disinhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flutamide</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1967 by Neri {{and colleagues at}} Schering Plough Corporation. It was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent, but was subsequently, and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogen activity. The code name of <b>flutamide</b> during development was SCH-13521. Clinical research of the drug began in 1971, and it was first marketed in 1983. <b>Flutamide</b> was not introduced in the United States until 1989; it was specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{for the treatment of}} metastatic prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. <b>Flutamide</b> was the first NSAA to be introduced, and was followed by nilutamide in 1989 and then bicalutamide in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Bicalutamide is an arylpropionamide analog, seen {{in figure}} 6. It has {{replaced}} <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. Bicalutamide is not as hepatotoxic as <b>flutamide</b> and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. Bicalutamide shares the amide bond structure with <b>flutamide.</b> Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of bicalutamide in humans.|$|E

5000|$|First-generation [...] {{including}} bicalutamide, <b>flutamide,</b> and nilutamide are synthetic, nonsteroidal anilide (N-phenyl amide) derivatives {{and structural}} analogues of each other. Bicalutamide is a diaryl propionamide, while <b>flutamide</b> is a monoarylpropionamide and nilutamide is a hydantoin. Bicalutamide and <b>flutamide,</b> though not nilutamide, {{can also be}} classified as toluidides. All three of the compounds share a common 3-trifluoromethyl aniline moiety. Bicalutamide is a modification of <b>flutamide</b> in which a 4-fluoro phenyl sulfonyl moiety has been added and the nitro group on the original phenyl ring has been replaced with a cyano group. Topilutamide, also known as fluridil, is another [...] that is closely related structurally to the first-generation , but, in contrast to them, is not used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer and is instead used exclusively as a topical antiandrogen in the treatment of androgenic alopecia.|$|E
50|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>flutamide</b> are sex-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to {{androgen}} deprivation may occur, the most common being gynecomastia and breast tenderness The vast majority (>90%) of cases of gynecomastia with NSAAs including <b>flutamide</b> are mild to moderate. and others including hot flashes, decreased muscle mass, decreased bone mass and an associated increased risk of fractures, depression, and sexual dysfunction including reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, <b>flutamide</b> is, generally, relatively well-tolerated, and does not interfere with ovulation. The only common side effect reported with <b>flutamide</b> in women is dry skin (75%), which is attributable to diminished androgen-mediated sebum production. General side effects that may occur in either sex include dizziness, anorexia, gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, a greenish-bluish discoloration of the urine, and hepatic changes. Because <b>flutamide</b> is a pure antiandrogen, unlike steroidal antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate (which additionally possess progestogenic activity), {{it does not appear}} to have a risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., thromboembolism) or fluid retention.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} case reports have {{associated}} <b>flutamide</b> with photosensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Diarrhea is {{more common}} and {{sometimes}} more severe with <b>flutamide</b> than with other NSAAs. In a comparative trial of combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer, the rate of diarrhea was 26% for <b>flutamide</b> and 12% for bicalutamide. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the drug due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5-20% for <b>flutamide,</b> 2-5% for bicalutamide, and 2-4% for nilutamide. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three drugs.|$|E
