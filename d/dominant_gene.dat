5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal <b>dominant</b> <b>gene,</b> which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single <b>dominant</b> <b>gene</b> encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Scottish Fold {{was a white}} barn cat named Susie, who {{was found}} at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, {{two of them were}} born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in Great Britain in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding program produced 76 kittens in the first three years—42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple <b>dominant</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

50|$|Resistance to Bremia lactucae in Lactuca serriola {{is due to}} Dm <b>genes,</b> {{or single}} <b>dominant</b> <b>genes.</b> Nine of the <b>dominant</b> <b>genes</b> that confer {{resistance}} are Dml, Dm, Dm3, Dm6, Dml4, Dml5, DmlO, Dm5/8, Dm10, Dm4, Dm7, Dm11, and Dm13. These genes are mapped in four linkage groups, so the genes within each group {{will be more likely}} to be inherited together. Lactuca serriola and B. lactucae have a gene-for-gene relationship, meaning that each resistance gene in the plant is associated with a specific gene in the pathogen, with avirulence being dominant to virulence. The possible combinations of these Dm genes can provide the plant with resistance to multiple strains of Bremia lactucae.|$|R
25|$|Current {{research}} regarding EEC {{syndrome is}} focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually have the disease, due to the expression of the <b>dominant</b> <b>gene</b> in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a vertical transmission pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in generation after generation. Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a <b>dominant</b> <b>gene</b> for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal <b>dominant</b> <b>gene.</b> If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

The additive genetic variance was more important than dominance genetic variance in the inheritance of DNA content under SI treatment.

Traits such as plant height, tillers per plant, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield per plant were governed by over-dominance type of gene action.
