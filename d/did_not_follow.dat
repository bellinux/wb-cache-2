5|$|By 1996 Widerøe had {{undertaken}} {{a series}} of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another concern was that pilots <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to improve safety.|$|E

Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|German {{armoured}} forces advanced north {{over the}} Dordrecht bridge to IJsselmonde island. Three tanks, two PzKpfw. IIs and a Panzerkampfwagen III {{of the staff}} platoon of the 1st Tank Battalion, stormed the Barendrecht bridge into the Hoekse Waard, {{but all of them}} were lost to a single 47mm antitank-gun. Though the Germans <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> up their attack, this area too was abandoned by the Dutch troops.|$|E

However, the club <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> their rivals Olimpija and Mura on that path.|$|E

5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor {{and four other}} Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads. She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow,</b> however, and after firing a gun to windward {{as a sign of}} contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> {{a lesson}} plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, {{she used her}} lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appearance}} on Jeopardy!, Chu contacted publicists and PR firms {{to ask for}} {{suggestions on how to}} monetize the recognition from his Jeopardy! run. However, he found the proposals unappealing, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> suggestions that he use the 'successful game theorist' image. Instead, he started writing a column for The Daily Beast, and later for Salon. Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American. He is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying, and is known for his opposition to the Gamergate movement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} four, Sarmiento {{was taught}} to read by {{his father and his}} uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of Cuyo. Another uncle who {{influenced}} him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing Juan Manuel de Rosas to power. Though Sarmiento <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> de Oro's political and religious leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty. He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> {{a belief that}} for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was essential. In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist studies as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
5|$|In 580, Hormizd IV {{abolished}} the Caucasian Iberian monarchy, and turned Iberia into a Persian province {{ruled by a}} marzpan (governor). During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides. In 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E

5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound {{in terms of}} the Prussian foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> this reduction by 2%.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{was born}} in Venice, the only son of Doge Otto Orseolo. His mother was a sister of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary; {{historian}} Gyula Kristó suggests that he {{was born in}} 1010 or 1011. The Venetians rose up and deposed Otto Orseolo in 1026. Peter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> his father, who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople; he instead went to Hungary, where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army.|$|E

Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{demand for}} Greek New Testaments {{led to a}} flurry of further {{authorized}} and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century; almost {{all of which were}} based on Erasmus's work and incorporated his particular readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own.

5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service.

There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E

Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.|$|E
