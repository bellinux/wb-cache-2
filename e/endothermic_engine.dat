50|$|Throughout its history, Micro-Vett {{implemented}} many electric-powered prototypes, {{including the}} bus Albatros {{in collaboration with}} the local public transport company of Rimini, a Ducato with <b>endothermic</b> <b>engine</b> on the front axle and electric motor on the rear axle in partnership with Al-Ko, a three-wheels motorcycle, a bimodal hearse, an all-electric excavator in collaboration with Venieri, a bimodal boat for carrying 70 people, etc..Micro-Vett also developed CHAdeMO protocols for rapid charging of its vehicles at 50 kW; moreover the company also attended many national and European projects, including Green eMotion under the 7th European framework program.|$|E
50|$|The {{company from}} Imola {{continues}} {{the production of}} Rascal, but, {{given the lack of}} involvement of the vehicle manufacturer, approached Piaggio with which, starting from 1994, launches a collaboration for the electrification of Porter.This vehicle, thanks to purchasing incentives, meets a great success in the Italian market and it’s manufactured from 1994 to 2003 in about 5,000 units. The lead-acid batteries provide a range of 60 km and a top speed of 65 km/h. Piaggio delivers the vehicles without <b>endothermic</b> <b>engine</b> to Micro-Vett and here they’re converted into electric. The sale of the complete vehicle is done in almost all cases directly by Piaggio.During this period the company took part in many sport events for electric vehicles, including the 24 hours of Turin and the Monte-Carlo Rally for alternative energies propelled vehicles, by winning prestigious results.|$|E
50|$|Giacosa {{served as}} President of FISITA, the International Federation of Automotive Engineering Societies, from 1967 to 1969 and {{authored}} Motori Endotermici (transaled from Italian: <b>Endothermic</b> <b>Engines),</b> which discusses diverse features related to internal combustion machines with explanations of their design, construction and function. The work became a reference for mechanical engineering courses in many universities and {{was translated into}} numerous languages.|$|R
40|$|We are {{accustomed}} to looking at the car industry {{from the viewpoint of}} big corporations and large car-assembly plants. We will now show you a different picture taken from a different angle: a filiere producing engines; every kind of <b>engine,</b> we mean <b>endothermic</b> <b>engines.</b> Furthermore, we will also show that this filiere is strongly rooted in the territory and that the same territory hosts three different famous racing car brands (namely, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati) and the same territory chosen to revive the Bugatti marque and to start-up a new car factory producing luxury cars, {{as is the case with}} Qvale, an investor and a manufacturer from USA. How did it happen that such a narrow strip of land- roughly 22. 123 km 2 - has become the cradle of so many different businesses in some way related to the car industry? What does it imply for the future of the territory and how is the filiere is changing as a result of the globalisation process? This paper is an inquiry into these issues. 1 Web Sites research by Ivich Sondermeijer...|$|R
40|$|Review of {{the current}} {{technical}} and programmatic status of the Integrated System Test of an Airbreathing Rocket (ISTAR) project. November 2002 completed Phase 1 of this project: which worked the conceptual design of the X- 43 B demonstrator vehicle and Flight Test Engine (FTE) order to develop realistic requirements for the Ground Test Engine (GTE). The latest conceptual FTE and X- 43 B configuration is briefly reviewed. The project plan is to reduce risk to the GTE and FTE concepts through several tests: thruster, fuel <b>endothermic</b> characterization, <b>engine</b> structure/heat exchanger, injection characterization rig, and full scale direct connect combustion rig. Each of these will be discussed along with the project schedule. This discussion is limited due to ITAR restrictions on open literature papers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the Power-Oriented Graphs (POG) {{technique}} {{is used for}} modeling planetary gears and hybrid automotive systems. Some basic properties of the POG technique are firstly given. An extended dynamic model of a planetary gear with internal elasticity is presented. Then a POG congruent state space transformation is used to transform and reduce the system when the elasticities or the inertias go to zero. The obtained reduced model is used as central element of an hybrid automotive power structure (<b>endothermic</b> <b>engine,</b> multi-phase synchronous motor and vehicle dynamics). Simulation results of the modeled hybrid system ends the paper...|$|E
40|$|Battery-powered {{autonomous}} mowers {{are designed}} to reduce the need of labor for lawn mowing compared with traditional <b>endothermic</b> <b>engine</b> mowers {{and at the same}} time to abate local emissions and noise. The aim of this research was to compare autonomous mower with traditional rotary mower on a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) lawn under different nitrogen (N) rates. A two-way factor experimental design with three replications was adopted. In the study, fourNrates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kghaL 1) and two mowing systems (autonomous mower vs. gasolinepowered walk-behind rotary mower equipped for mulching) were used. As expected, N fertilization increased turf quality. At the end of the trial, the autonomous mower increased turf density (3. 2 shoots/cm 2) compared with the rotary mower (2. 1 shoots/cm 2) and decreased average leaf width (2. 1 mm) compared with the rotary mower (2. 7 mm). Increased density and decreased leaf width with autonomous mowing yielded higher quality turf (7. 3) compared with the rotary mower (6. 4) and a lower weed incidence (6...|$|E
