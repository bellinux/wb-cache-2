5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or <b>hectopascals,</b> along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E

50|$|In aircraft, an aneroid {{barometer}} measures the atmospheric pressure from a static port outside the aircraft. Air pressure decreases {{with an increase}} of altitude—approximately 100 <b>hectopascals</b> per 800 meters or one inch of mercury per 1000 feet near sea level.|$|E

50|$|Atmospheric air {{pressure}} is often given in millibars where standard sea level pressure {{is defined as}} 1013.25 mbar, 101.325 kPa, 1.01325 bar, which is about 14.7 {{pounds per square inch}} (PSI). Despite the millibar not being an SI unit, meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured {{air pressure}} in millibars as the values are convenient. After the advent of SI units, some meteorologists began using <b>hectopascals</b> (symbol hPa) which are numerically equivalent to millibars; for the same reason, the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries. For example, the weather office of Environment Canada uses kilopascals and <b>hectopascals</b> on their weather maps. In contrast, Americans are familiar {{with the use of the}} millibar in US reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic storms.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric {{pressures}} are usually stated using <b>hectopascal</b> (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres (atm). In American and Canadian engineering, stress is often measured in kip. Note that stress {{is not a}} true pressure since it is not scalar. In the cgs system the unit of pressure was the barye (ba), equal to 1 dyn·cm−2. In the mts system, the unit of pressure was the pieze, equal to 1 sthene per square metre.|$|R

The Ep's Pixels and Pixies, and Alive in Veddige were released on Candy Mind Records.|$|R
50|$|This {{measure is}} {{included}} in the SI mostly for completeness: in principle, any combination of prefix and unit can be written, but many are rarely used in practice. One practical use of the decameter is for altitude of geopotential heights in meteorology. Meteorologists also use another seldom encountered SI prefix: hecto- in <b>hectopascal</b> (hPa). The volumetric form (see below) cubic decametre is convenient for describing large volumes of water such as in rivers and lakes.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{variables}} {{made available to}} the public include precipitation and surface temperature (both of which are available both on a global spatial scale and a continental one), winds at 200 and 850 <b>hectopascals</b> (hPa), and heights at 500 hPa (all of which are available only at the global or hemispheric scale). Output is rendered as deviation from normal.|$|E
50|$|Aerography is the {{production}} of weather charts. The information is supplied by radiosonde observations, principally. Constant-pressure charts are routinely constructed at standard air pressures. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 millibars (<b>hectopascals)</b> (hPa) (SI). Weather charts are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12 km). The lines of equal air pressure are called isobars. Isotherms are the lines of equal air temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{units of}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{commonly used in}} meteorology were formerly the bar, which {{was close to the}} average air pressure on Earth, and the millibar. Since the introduction of SI units, meteorologists generally measure pressures in <b>hectopascals</b> (hPa) unit, equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar. Exceptions include Canada and Portugal, which use kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, the SI is preferred, which means Pa with a prefix (in multiples of 1000) is preferred.|$|E
50|$|The cloud height, more {{commonly}} known as cloud thickness or depth, is {{the distance between the}} cloud base and the cloud top. It is traditionally expressed either in metres or as a pressure difference in <b>hectopascal</b> (hPa, equivalent to millibar). Sometimes, the expression cloud height is used instead of cloud base, in which case the context has to clarify whether the intent is to designate the height of the base of the cloud or the size of it.|$|R
50|$|Although {{formerly}} in use, the SI disallows combining prefixes; the microkilogram or centimillimetre, for example, are not permitted. Prefixes {{corresponding to}} powers of one thousand are usually preferred, however, units {{such as the}} <b>hectopascal,</b> hectare, decibel, centimetre, and centilitre, are commonly used. In mathematical contexts, the unit prefixes are always {{considered part of the}} unit, so that, e.g., in exponentiation, 1 km2 means one square kilometre not one thousand square metre and 1 cm3 means one cubic centimetre not one hundredth of a cubic metre.|$|R
50|$|The {{strength}} of Bise wind {{can be determined}} by the analysis of the air pressure difference (in <b>hectopascal</b> hPa) between Geneva and Guettingen (TG). Bise arises as soon as the air pressure in Guettingen (TG) is higher than in Geneva. The greater this air pressure difference, the stronger the Bise blows through the Midland. In case of an inverted air pressure difference (low air pressure in Guettingen (TG) and high air pressure in Geneva), the opposite of Bise occurs: The wind blows from southwest through the Midland.|$|R
