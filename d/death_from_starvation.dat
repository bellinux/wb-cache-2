5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent <b>death</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation.</b>|$|E

Drought, the major climate risk of Cape Verdean islands, is much less pronounced on Fogo, due to the mountain's ability to gain moisture from clouds. During the mid-nineteenth century, Fogo suffered from severe droughts. <b>Death</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation</b> was common in the population as of 1832.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{reindeer}} {{in southwestern}} Greenland have no naturally occurring non-human predators, harvesting quotas are established to help regulate {{the number of}} reindeer in an area and prevent overgrazing and <b>death</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation.</b> During the winter, the great effort of pawing down (known as [...] "cratering") through the snow to their favorite food, a lichen known as reindeer moss, can cost them too many calories in expended energy, causing them to lose strength and die. Without human monitoring and regulation, mass starvation of reindeer would be a recurring problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{environment}} of early humans shaped {{the evolution of}} ingestive regulatory mechanisms, starvation {{used to be a}} greater threat to survival than overeating. Human metabolism evolved to store energy within the body to prevent <b>death</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation.</b> Today, the environment now has an opposite effect on humans eating behaviors. With the widespread availability of food in today's society, concern has shifted from starvation to overeating. As food scarcity and availability have become less and less of a problem, food intake has increased. The increase of food intake by so many people is due primarily to a number of environmental factors. Main social environmental factors include: ...|$|E

Regardless, German soldiers regularly raped young Herero women before killing them or letting them die in the desert.

5000|$|The first {{reports of}} mass {{malnutrition}} and <b>deaths</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation</b> emerged <b>from</b> two urban {{areas of the}} city of Uman, reported in January 1933 by Vinnytsia and Kiev oblasts. By mid-January 1933, there were reports about mass [...] "difficulties" [...] with food in urban areas, which had been undersupplied through the rationing system, and <b>deaths</b> <b>from</b> <b>starvation</b> among people who were withdrawn from the rationing supply. The withdrawal was to comply with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Decree of December 1932. By the beginning of February 1933, according to reports from local authorities and Ukrainian GPU, the most affected area was Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which also suffered from epidemics of typhus and malaria. Odessa and Kiev oblasts were second and third, respectively. By mid-March, most of the reports of <b>starvation</b> originated <b>from</b> Kiev Oblast.|$|R
