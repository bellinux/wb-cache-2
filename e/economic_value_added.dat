These involve managing the relationship between a firm's short-term assets and its short-term liabilities. In general this is as follows: As above, the goal of Corporate Finance is the maximization of firm value. In the context of long term, capital budgeting, firm value is enhanced through appropriately selecting and funding NPV positive investments. These investments, in turn, have implications in terms of cash flow and cost of capital. The goal of Working Capital (i.e. short term) management is therefore to ensure that the firm is able to operate, and that it has sufficient cash flow to service long-term debt, and to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital; See <b>Economic</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> (EVA).

Investigation of the 336 acquisitions occurring during 2000 to 2011 reveals that acquiring firms experience significantly deteriorating EVA {{after the completion}} of acquisitions. Further, this study evaluates the performance of other traditional accounting measures including Earning per share (EPS), Return on capital (ROC), Return of Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) post acquisition. The results suggest that acquiring firms tend to experience slightly improved performance after completion of the acquisitions when using traditional accounting measures. But the improved operating performance is wiped out by capital costs of the large premiums paid to the target firm, creating no real economic gains to the acquiring firm‘s shareholder...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the degree {{and type of}} private equity firm activism in portfolio companies. Using hand-collected data on 211 private equity investments over the period 1997 - 2009, {{we are able to}} distinguish between different kinds of activism of private equity firms such as board and management reorganizations, balance sheet restructurings or the utilization of private equity firm industry-specific skills. We additionally differentiate between “good” activism which is <b>economic</b> <b>value</b> <b>adding,</b> or “evil” activism which is purely earnings management-driven. Our results show that both buyout and venture capital firms invest with varying degrees and types of activism. We also find that earnings management is a pivotal part of an active investment strategy, both for buyouts and venture deals. The choice for pursuing active or passive strategies depends on the respective buyout and venture firms’ overall business models. However, the PE firms also adjust their investment styles in accordance with the specifics of each single portfolio firm. Activism also has a positive long-term effect on stock performance relative to firms backed by passive private equity investors...|$|R

The result is shown as a percentage, determined by dividing relevant income for the 12 months by capital employed; return on equity (ROE) shows this result for the firm's shareholders. Firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital, which results from working-capital management, exceeds the cost of capital, which results from capital investment decisions as above. ROC measures are therefore useful as a management tool, in that they link short-term policy with long-term decision making. See <b>economic</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> (EVA).|$|E
