As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, {{that it is the}} wrong thing to <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

25|$|We {{should be}} candid about the {{interests}} surrounding Indian gaming.

25|$|In {{addition}} to philosophy, Boyle devoted {{much time to}} theology, showing a very decided leaning to the practical side and an indifference to controversial polemics.

25|$|In 1939 Willis L. Teeter—who {{also worked}} for A, at its Mooresville, North Carolina store—and his brother Paul, who was also working for A {{borrowed}} $1,700 to open Teeter's Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville, North Carolina. A was closing their doors and agreed to lease the location to the Teeter brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter's was a family-run operation as Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager and Teeter's wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul's wife, Mildred, also joined the staff as bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their foresight of providing great customer service and only the best products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Golden Rule—treat others as you would have them treat you.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Fangio {{returned}} to Maserati, {{who were still}} using the same iconic 250F which Fangio had driven {{at the start of}} 1954. Fangio started the season with a hat-trick of wins in Argentina, Monaco and France, before retiring with engine problems in Britain. At the next race, the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring circuit, Fangio needed to extend his lead by six points to claim the title with two races to spare. From pole position Fangio dropped to third behind the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Collins but managed to get past both {{by the end of the}} third lap. Fangio had started with half-full tanks since he expected that he would need new tyres halfway through the race. In the event Fangio pitted on lap 13 with a 30-second lead, but a disastrous stop left him back in third place and 50 seconds behind Collins and Hawthorn. Fangio came into his own, setting one fastest lap after another, culminating in a record-breaking time on lap 20 a full eleven seconds faster than the best the Ferraris could <b>do.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> penultimate lap Fangio got back past both Collins and Hawthorn, and held on to take the win by just over three seconds. With Musso finishing down in fourth place, Fangio claimed his fifth title. This performance is often regarded as the greatest drive in Formula One history, and it was to be Fangio's last win.|$|E

500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E

[...] He assembled a talented frontline in Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Jimmy McIntosh, and Alex Munro; with an emphasis on entertaining football. The Seasiders finished in ninth place and reached the 1948 FA Cup Final. On 23 April 1948, the eve of the final, Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award. Despite taking the lead twice in the match, Blackpool lost out 4–2 to Matt Busby's Manchester United in the final, with Matthews assisting Mortensen for Blackpool's second.|$|E
500|$|In January 1910, Walter Camp {{published}} his All-Time All-American list in Century magazine, selecting {{the best player}} at each position over the 20years he had been watching college football.

At the time, Camp said: [...] "Big, strong and fast, he combined all the defensive and offensive qualities of the best line men with the speed, sure tackling and intuition as to what to <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instant that are winning qualities of the defensive back. [...] In addition, his passing was excellent, as he had plenty of speed for his kicker, steadiness for his quarter, and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays".|$|E

Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted to <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record.

500|$|Bede is {{described}} by Michael Lapidge as [...] "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often <b>do</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read. In the words of Charles Plummer, {{one of the best-known}} editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede's Latin is [...] "clear and limpid... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence...
