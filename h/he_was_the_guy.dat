[...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E
