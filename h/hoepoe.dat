The new species are Catenotaenia capensis from the Striped Mouse, Dilepis megacirrosa from the Golden Mole, Biuterinoides upupai from the <b>Hoepoe</b> and Ascaris suricattae from the Surricat. Another species of cestode from the Golden Mole is identified as Dilepis sphaerocephala (Rud. 1819) and its morphology is described.
