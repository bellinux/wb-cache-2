500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|Front pin first:In this {{variant of}} the game, pins are counted only if the front pin is knocked over first. If the front pin is missed, any pins that are knocked over are not reset.

2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend." ...|$|E

50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|R
