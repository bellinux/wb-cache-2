25|$|The <b>intermetallics</b> form {{distinct}} phases, usually as inclusions in a ductile {{solid solution}} matrix, but also can form the matrix itself with metal inclusions or form crystalline matter with different <b>intermetallics.</b> <b>Intermetallics</b> are often hard and brittle. Finely distributed <b>intermetallics</b> in a ductile matrix yield a hard alloy while coarse structure gives a softer alloy. A range of <b>intermetallics</b> often forms between the metal and the solder, with increasing {{proportion of the}} metal; e.g. forming a structure of Cu-Cu3Sn-Cu6Sn5-Sn.|$|E
25|$|Layers of <b>intermetallics</b> {{can form}} between the solder and the {{soldered}} material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and brittleness, increased electrical resistance, or electromigration and formation of voids. The gold-tin <b>intermetallics</b> layer {{is responsible for}} poor mechanical reliability of tin-soldered gold-plated surfaces where the gold plating did not completely dissolve in the solder.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{a direct}} {{magnetic}} field on the interfacial microstructure between molten aluminium and solid iron was studied. The <b>intermetallic</b> phases formed in the <b>intermetallic</b> layers were investigated by means of electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

40|$|In {{this study}} {{laminated}} Al/Cu composite {{was obtained by}} explosion welding. The effect of strain-hardened zones and the <b>intermetallic</b> layer on thermal conductivity coefficient was investigated. For this purpose the specimens after explosion welding and after subsequent annealing to obtain the <b>intermetallic</b> layer were studied by X-ray methods and means of optical microscopy to determine the phase composition and the width of <b>intermetallic</b> layer. The microhardness tests were carried out to identify {{the width of the}} strain-hardened zones and the <b>intermetallic</b> layer. The thermal conductivity coefficient of the composite was experimentally measured to calculate the thermal properties of the strain-hardened zones and <b>intermetallic</b> layer. The width of the strain-hardened zone and the <b>intermetallic</b> layer was 80 μm and 160 μm respectively.

25|$|Gold and {{palladium}} readily dissolve in solders. Copper {{and nickel}} tend to form intermetallic layers during normal soldering profiles. Indium forms <b>intermetallics</b> as well.|$|E

30|$|The <b>intermetallic</b> {{compounds}} {{formed in}} the interface zone of Al-Cu have both favourable effects and {{detrimental effects on the}} joints. Moreover, some of the <b>intermetallic</b> compound phases formed {{have been found to be}} the same in both fusion welding and solid-state welding. The characteristics of these <b>intermetallic</b> compounds vary according to the location of the phase formed. Definitive reasons for defective <b>intermetallic</b> compound formation are not known. More researches are therefore needed to investigate reduction in brittle <b>intermetallic</b> compound formation, the factors promoting the formation of such compounds and their effect on weld properties. There is moreover a need for a significant research on dissimilar welding of Al with Cu to optimise manufacture of defect-free Al-Cu joints without brittle <b>intermetallic</b> compounds and thus enable industrial-scale production.|$|R

The structure is made from lamina blanks which comprise multiple layers of metals which are patternable, or <b>intermetallic</b> lamina blanks that are patternable. Lamina blanks are patterned, stacked and registered, and processed to form a monolithic <b>intermetallic</b> structure. The advantages of a patterned monolithic <b>intermetallic</b> structure include physical characteristics such as melting temperature, thermal conductivity, and corrosion resistance.

Monolithic <b>intermetallic</b> structures may contain one or more catalysts within the internal features...|$|R
25|$|Gold– easily dissolves, forms brittle <b>intermetallics,</b> {{contamination}} above 0.5% causes sluggishness {{and decreases}} wetting. Lowers melting point of tin-based solders. Higher-tin alloys can absorb more gold without embrittlement.|$|E
25|$|Indium-gold <b>intermetallics</b> are brittle and occupy about 4 {{times more}} volume than the {{original}} gold. Bonding wires are especially susceptible to indium attack. Such intermetallic growth, together with thermal cycling, can lead to failure of the bonding wires.|$|E
25|$|Lead-tin solder layers on copper leads {{can form}} copper-tin {{intermetallic}} layers; the solder alloy is then locally depleted of tin {{and form a}} lead-rich layer. The Sn-Cu <b>intermetallics</b> then can get exposed to oxidation, resulting in impaired solderability.|$|E

It {{was found that the}} <b>intermetallic</b> layers consist of α-AlFeSi, β-AlFeSi and θ-AlFe.

25|$|Crystal {{structures}} are typically categorized as minerals, metals-alloys, inorganics, organics, nucleic acids, and biological macromolecules. Individual crystal structure databases cater for users in specific chemical, molecular-biological, or related disciplines by covering super- or subsets of these categories. Minerals {{are a subset}} of mostly inorganic compounds. The category ‘metals-alloys’ covers metals, alloys, and <b>intermetallics.</b> Metals-alloys and inorganics can be merged into ‘non-organics’. Organic compounds and biological macromolecules are separated according to molecular size. Organic salts, organometallics, and metalloproteins tend to be attributed to organics or biological macromolecules, respectively. Nucleic acids are a subset of biological macromolecules.|$|E
25|$|Tin-based solders readily {{dissolve}} gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys {{the critical}} concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich solders (usually indium-lead) are {{more suitable for}} soldering thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate of gold in indium is much slower. Tin-rich solders also readily dissolve silver; for soldering silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their wettability is poorer. If the soldering time is long enough to form the <b>intermetallics,</b> the tin surface of a joint soldered to gold is very dull.|$|E
25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in {{a solder}} joint formation: interaction between the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The base metal dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of <b>intermetallics</b> can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable barrier layer to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|E

We {{focused on}} the surface {{reinforcement}} of ligth weight casting alloys with Ni 3 Al <b>intermetallic</b> compounds by in-situ combustion reaction to improve the surface properties of non-ferrous casting components. In the present work, by setting the mixture of elemental Ni and Al powders in a casting mold, the powder mixture reacted to form Ni 3 Al <b>intermetallic</b> compound by SHS reaction ignited by the heat of molten AZ 91 D Mg alloy and simultaneously bonded with the Mg casting alloy.

25|$|Indium {{lowers the}} melting point and {{improves}} ductility. In presence of lead {{it forms a}} ternary compound that undergoes phase change at 114°C. Very high cost (several times of silver), low availability. Easily oxidizes, which causes problems for repairs and reworks, especially when oxide-removing flux cannot be used, e.g. during GaAs die attachment. Indium alloys are used for cryogenic applications, and for soldering gold as gold dissolves in indium much less than in tin. Indium can also solder many nonmetals (e.g. glass, mica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, porcelain, brick, concrete, and marble). Prone to diffusion into semiconductors and cause undesired doping. At elevated temperatures easily diffuses through metals. Low vapor pressure, suitable for use in vacuum systems. Forms brittle <b>intermetallics</b> with gold; indium-rich solders on thick gold are unreliable. Indium-based solders are prone to corrosion, especially in presence of chloride ions.|$|E
