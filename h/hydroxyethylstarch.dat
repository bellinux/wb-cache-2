Six dogs were then infused with 7. 5 % NaCl in 5 ml/kg <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (HTS group), and six received 6 % <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> alone (HES group) in an amount to ap-proximate the maximum MAP achieved with hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline replacement was- 16 % of shed blood volume compared with 66 % for <b>hydroxyethylstarch.</b> With hypertonic saline, cardiac output returned to base line, but 0, delivery did not. <b>Hydroxyethylstarch</b> increased cardiac output above base line, and 0, delivery was near base line. 0, uptake with hy-droxyethylstarch peaked at 40 % above control at 10 min of resuscitation.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The {{effects of}} {{administering}} albumin 5 %, <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> 6 % and succinylated gelatine 4 % on oxygen transport and left ventricular function were prospectively investigated in different experimental conditions: baseline, fluid load, after 10 min of myocardial ischaemia and after reperfusion. METHODS: Twenty-seven rabbits received at random {{one of three}} colloids in escalating boluses over 10 - 15 min to achieve left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) between 8 and 10 mmHg. A branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery was then temporarily occluded by a ligature and released after 10 min. Myocardial function was assessed using left ventricular pressure recordings and dimension data obtained from ultrasound crystals inserted onto the ventricular wall. Blood was sampled for the determination of oxygen delivery and consumption, the oxygen extraction ratio, acid-base status, and glucose and lactate concentrations. RESULTS: Administration of the colloids similarly increased oxygen delivery and improved left ventricular function in all groups. Peak rate of pressure development (dP/dt(max)) and oxygen delivery were reduced during ischaemia and reperfusion. The decrease in dP/dt(max) was more pronounced in the <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of albumin 5 %, <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> 6 % and succinylated gelatine 4 % had similar effects on oxygen delivery and myocardial function.

This thesis evaluates 1. The safety of current fluid therapy, 2. The effects of novel versus established volume expanders on endothelial function and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), 3. The effect of Sildenafil on renal glycocalyx in post-CPB AKI and 4. The effect of standard and modified red cell transfusions on lung and kidney injury. Using a systematic assessment of randomised controlled trials comparing colloids and crystalloids, we found that <b>Hydroxyethylstarches</b> are associated with increased risk of mortality and AKI. On the contrary, {{there was no evidence}} that Gelatins, Dextrans and Crystalloids were associated with increased harm. We evaluated the supremacy of novel AQIX RS- 1 ® for intravenous resuscitation in a swine model of general anesthesia but failed to show its superiority as an endothelial and organ protective agent compared to Hartmann’s solution. We characterized that CPB mediated AKI is associated with modifications of Glycosaminoglycans and core protein components of Glycocalyx, but also that CPB induces detrimental changes in endothelial surface markers; vWF, Thrombomodulin, VE-Cadherin. These structural modifications caused direct reduction in Nitric Oxide bioavailability, renal artery vasomotor function and invoked AKI in swine. Post CPB-AKI was prevented by restoration of depleted NO bioavailability using Sildenafil Citrate without restoration of glomerular endothelial membrane (GEM) constituents. We explored the pathogenesis of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) and implicate alterations in red cell metabolomics; endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, microparticles and labile Iron and use a translational porcine model of TRALI to test red cell Rejuvenation coupled with red cell washing as a promising therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, comparative trial. PATIENTS: Thirty ASA 1 - 2 patients, scheduled for lumbar intervertebral disc surgery were randomly allocated to three groups receiving either 2, 000 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (RL, n = 10), 750 mL of <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> 6 % (HEA, n = 10) or 2, 000 mL of normal saline (NaCl, n = 10). METHODS: Baseline osmolality, natraemia, glycaemia and protidaemia were measured before induction of anaesthesia (T 1), after the infusion of 375 mL of <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> or 1, 000 mL of crystalloids (T 2) {{and at the end of}} the infusion (T 3). RESULTS: The three groups were identical for age, weight, initial plasma osmolality and natraemia. However, osmolality in the RL group was decreased at T 2 and T 3 compared to T 1 (respectively: 299 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1, 295 +/- 4 mOsm. kg- 1 and 292 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1. Osmolality at T 2 and T 3 was also lower in the RL group compared to the HEA and NaCl groups (respectively: 301 +/- 6 mOsm. kg- 1 and 304 +/- 13 mOsm. kg- 1 for T 2 and T 3 in the HEA group, and 299 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1 and 298 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1 in the NaCl group). In the HEA and NaCl groups, osmolality was unchanged at T 2 and T 3 compared to T 1.

The aim of the present pilot {{study was to examine the}} effect of goal directed therapy using fluid alone on postoperative renal function and organ failure score in patients undergoing emergency {{abdominal surgery}}. MethodsThis prospective randomised pilot study included patients over the age of 50 undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. In the intervention group pulse pressure variation measurements were used to guide fluid boluses of 6 % <b>Hydroxyethylstarch</b> 130 / 0. 4. The control group received standard care. Serum urea, creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured prior to and at the end of surgery and postoperatively on day 1, day 3 and day 5. ResultsThirty patients were recruited. One patient died prior to surgery and was excluded from the analysis. The intervention group received a median of 750 ml of <b>hydroxyethylstarch.</b> The peak values of postoperative urea were 6. 9 (2. 7 – 31. 8) vs. 6. 4 (3. 5 – 11. 5) mmol/l (p= 0. 425), creatinine 100 (60 – 300) vs. 85 (65 – 150) μmol/l (p= 0. 085) and cystatin C 1. 09 (0. 66 – 4. 94) vs. 1. 01 (0. 33 – 2. 29) mg/dl (p= 0. 352) in the control and intervention group, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{a recent}} {{clinical}} {{study on the}} reliability of a point-of-care (POC) analyzer, we described a downward bias in hematocrit measurement during cardiopulmonary bypass leading potentially to overtreatment with packed red cells. We hypothesized that the detected deviation is caused by variations in electrolyte concentration rather than by colloids used. METHODS: Blood was sampled from patients before cardiac surgery to obtain undiluted anticoagulated whole blood samples (n = 53). From each sample, four dilution series covering a hematocrit range of 15 - 30 % were made using NaCl (0. 9 %), modified gelatine (4 %), <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (6 %), or a potassium-based (16 mEq/l) solution, respectively. In each dilution series, hematocrit was measured by POC and via the "golden standard" microcentrifugal method {{to determine whether the}} deviation of the POC-analyzer to the microcentrifuge was dependent on the type and dilution level of the solution used. RESULTS: In contrast to the colloid-based dilution series, the crystalloids revealed a significant downward bias of the POC-analyzer with respect to the microcentrifuge (p < 0. 05). Due to the correction algorithm for sodium in the POC-analyzer, this deviation was nearly constant for NaCl (mean of difference: - 1. 8 +/- 0. 1 %), but increased significantly in case of the potassium-based solution (up to - 8. 2 +/- 0. 4 % after 1. 5 -times dilution). The starch- and gelatine-based solutions led to a significant upward bias (p < 0. 05) that increased with progressing dilution (up to 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 % for <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> and up to 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 % for modified gelatine after 1. 5 -times dilution). CONCLUSIONS: Conductivity-based POC hematocrit measurement suffers from biases due to changes of the plasma constituents. The downward bias in hematocrit as often seen during cardiopulmonary bypass is driven by changes of different electrolyte concentration rather than by colloids used per se...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hypertonic saline {{hydroxyethyl}} starch (HH) has been recommended for {{first line treatment}} of hemorrhagic shock. Its effects on coagulation are unclear. We studied in vitro effects of HH dilution on whole blood coagulation and platelet function. Furthermore 7. 2 % hypertonic saline, 6 % <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (as ingredients of HH), and 0. 9 % saline solution (as control) were tested in comparable dilutions to estimate specific component effects of HH on coagulation. Methods The study was designed as experimental non-randomized comparative in vitro study. Following institutional review board approval and informed consent blood samples were taken from 10 healthy volunteers and diluted in vitro with either HH (HyperHaes ®, Fresenius Kabi, Germany), hypertonic saline (HT, 7. 2 % NaCl), <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (HS, HAES 6 %, Fresenius Kabi, Germany) or NaCl 0. 9 % (ISO) in a proportion of 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 %. Coagulation was studied in whole blood by rotation thrombelastometry (ROTEM) after thromboplastin activation without (ExTEM) and with inhibition of thrombocyte function by cytochalasin D (FibTEM), the latter was performed to determine fibrin polymerisation alone. Values are expressed as maximal clot firmness (MCF, [mm]) and clotting time (CT, [s]). Platelet aggregation was determined by impedance aggregrometry (Multiplate) after activation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (TRAP) and quantified by the area under the aggregation curve (AUC [aggregation units (AU) /min]). Scanning electron microscopy was performed to evaluate HyperHaes induced cell shape changes of thrombocytes. Statistics: 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurements, Bonferroni post hoc test, p Results Dilution impaired whole blood coagulation and thrombocyte aggregation in all dilutions in a dose dependent fashion. In contrast to dilution with ISO and HS, respectively, dilution with HH as well as HT almost abolished coagulation (MCF ExTEM from 57. 3 ± 4. 9 mm (native) to 1. 7 ± 2. 2 mm (HH 40 % dilution; p Conclusions HH impairs platelet function during in vitro dilution already at 5 % dilution.

To evaluate microvascular reactivity, postocclusive reactive hyperaemia was examined before and after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Loss of circulatory volume is {{one in a series}} of disturbed mechanisms that require proper correction. Causes of circulatory volume loss, hemodynamic instability and inadequate tissue perfusion are different: in sepsis and burns due to the higher capillary permeability, in trauma because of massive bleeding, etc. Infusion solutions, crystalloids and colloids have their good and bad qualities, and therefore must be seen as agents with specific indications, contraindications and the recommended doses.

The variability in endothelial response to thermal injury between patients is not addressed by standard resuscitation formulae. The initial post-burn ACR was a sensitive predictor {{of the difference between}} resuscitation fluid volume predicted and that actually required in the first 24 hours post-injury.

The goal of this large scale retrospective study was to detect whether there was an association between postoperative deterioration of renal function {{and the use of}} HES 200 kD, 0. 5 DS in the cardiac surgery setting. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of daily collected data in 3124 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass and/or valvular surgery. Three groups were compared according to differences in fluid therapy: [...] GEL: gelatin was used as priming fluid of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and for postoperative filling (n = 1276). [...] MIX: HES was used as priming fluid of ECC an gelatin was used for postoperative filling (n = 1008). [...] HES: HES was used as priming fluid of ECC and for postoperative filling (n = 840). MAIN RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} postoperative serum creatinine concentrations between the 3 groups: GEL: 12, 2 +/- 0, 5 mg/l; MIX: 12, 3 +/- 0. 5 mg/l; HES: 12, 3 +/- 0. 6 mg/l.

The final visual acuity in the IHT and control groups was 0. 30  (Snellen 6 / 12) and 0. 60  (Snellen 6 / 24) logMAR units, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The results support the theory that IHT has a positive effect on the visual outcome in patients with BRVO.    Keywords: branch retinal vein occlusion; haemodilution; laser treatment; macular oedem...|$|E
40|$|Hypovolemia is {{the most}} common cause of circulatory failure in {{children}} and may lead to critical tissue perfusion and eventually multiple-organ failure. Administration of fluids to maintain or restore intravascular volume represents a common intervention after hemorrhagic shock occurring during surgical procedures or in patients with trauma. Notwithstanding, there is uncertainty whether the type of fluid may significantly influence the outcome, especially in pediatrics. Both human albumin and crystalloids are usually administered: the advantages of crystalloids include low cost, lack of effect on coagulation, no risk of anaphylactic reaction or transmission of infectious agents. However, large amount of crystalloid infusion has been correlated with pulmonary oedema, bilateral pleural effusions, intestinal intussusception, excessive bowel edema, impairing closure of surgical wounds and peripheral edema. Moreover, intravascular volume expansion obtained by crystalloids is known to be significantly shorter and less efficacious than colloids. Among synthetic colloids, gelatins have been used for many years in children, also in early infancy, to treat intravascular fluid deficits. <b>Hydroxyethylstarch</b> (HES) preparations have been introduced recently, becoming very popular for vascular loading both in adults and children. However, the number of pediatric studies aimed at evaluating HES efficacy and tolerance is limited. Given the ongoing controversies on the use of colloids in childhood, this review will focus on the pharmacodynamics of synthetic and non synthetic colloids for the treatment of critical blood loss in pediatrics...|$|E
40|$|Background: Surgical {{blood loss}} {{can lead to}} {{ineffective}} tissue perfusion of vital organs, including the kidney. Physiologic solution chosen for blood volume replacement may be determinant for preserving renal integrity. Objectives: Study kidney histopathological changes in a hemorrhagic model, followed by intravascular volume replacement with Ringer's lactate or <b>Hydroxyethylstarch</b> 130 / 0. 4 solutions. Methods: Thirty one pigs under general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil underwent haemorrhage at a volume of 25 ml kg- 1, over 20 minutes. After a waiting period, intravascular volume was replaced using HES 130 / 0. 4 (group 1) and Ringer’s lactate (group 2). One hour after, pigs were euthanized and sixty two renal samples were taken for histopathological examination, using PAS staining. Renal damage was assessed for glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions. Contingency tables for frequency analysis were used. Results: Mean arterial pressure values (MAP) reached 40 mmHg after bleeding, and recovered for values above 60 mmHg in both groups after volume replacement. Histopathological lesions observed in Group 2 were more frequent than those in Group 1. Conclusion: HES 130 / 0. 4 may {{reduce the incidence of}} histopathological lesions secondary to renal hypoperfusion after severe bleeding when compared with Ringer Lactate. Results suggest that reestablishment of intravascular volume with HES 130 / 0. 4 may preserve renal integrity secondary to blood loss.

30|$|The {{experimental}} protocol {{was approved by}} the Tottori University Laboratory Animal Care Committee. Isolated rabbit lungs were prepared using the method described in detail by Liu et al. (1999) with minor modifications. Male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 1.9 – 2.6  kg were used. The lungs were ventilated with 93.5 % air and 6.5 % CO 2 (tidal volume 6  ml/kg; frequency 40 /min; positive end-expiratory pressure 2  cmH 2 O) and perfused with bicarbonate-buffered physiologic salt solution [PSS (in mM): NaCl, 119; KCl, 4.7; MgSO 4, 1.17; NaHCO 3, 22.61; KH 2 PO 4, 1.18; CaCl 2, 3.2] in a recirculating manner at a constant flow rate of 30  ml/kg/min. To each 100  ml of PSS stock solution, we added 100  mg dextrose, 20  mU insulin, and 5  g <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan). Pulmonary arterial pressure (PPA), left atrium pressure (PLA), and airway pressure (PAW) were monitored continuously via side ports in the respective cannula. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) in the perfusate was adjusted to 35 – 40  mmHg during the experiment by continuous aeration of the reservoir liquid surface using mixed gas with the same composition as the inspired gas. The empyreal part of the reservoir was covered with Saran Wrap®, and the liquid surface of the reservoir was separated from air. Gas analysis of the perfusate was performed during the experiment, and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate was added to the perfusate to maintain the pH at 7.35 – 7.45.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracoronary {{application}} of BM-derived cells {{for the treatment}} of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is currently being studied intensively. Simultaneously, strict legal requirements surround the production of cells for clinical studies. Thus good manufacturing practice (GMP) -compliant collection and preparation of BM for patients with AMI was established by the Cytonet group. METHODS: As well as fulfillment of standard GMP requirements, including a manufacturing license, validation of the preparation process and the final product was performed. Whole blood (n= 6) and BM (n= 3) validation samples were processed under GMP conditions by gelafundin or <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> sedimentation in order to reduce erythrocytes/platelets and volume and to achieve specifications defined in advance. Special attention was paid to the free potassium (< 6 mmol/L), some rheologically relevant cellular characteristics (hematocrit < 0. 45, platelets < 450 x 10 (6) /mL) and the sterility of the final product. RESULTS: The data were reviewed and GMP compliance was confirmed by the German authorities (Paul-Ehrlich Institute). Forty-five BM cell preparations for clinical use were carried out following the validated methodology and standards. Additionally three selections of CD 34 + BM cells for infusion were performed. All specification limits were met. Discussion In conclusion, preparation of BM cells for intracoronary application is feasible under GMP conditions. As the results of sterility testing may not be available at the time of intracoronary application, the highest possible standards to avoid bacterial and other contaminations have to be applied. The increased expense of the GMP-compliant process can be justified by higher safety for patients and better control of the final product...|$|E
40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) {{are one of the}} most interesting cell types for tissue engineering, cell therapy, basic scientific research, and drug screening. Fast advancement in these areas requires the availability of large amounts of safe and well-characterized hESCs from hESC banks. Therefore, optimized freezing protocols, allowing the cryopreservation of large amounts of hESC without direct contact with liquid nitrogen, need to be established. In this study, 6 different cryoprotector combinations [dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, and <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (HES) ] combined with 2 different application methods were screened with the VUB 01 cell line, to establish a new slow-freezing protocol with high recovery rates and a good expansion capacity. Our best conditions were confirmed in 4 other hESC lines: H 1, H 9, 181, and UGent 2. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HES is evaluated as a cryoprotector for hESCs. The use of 5 % DMSO + 5 % HES combined with a new detachment protocol leads to efficient hESC cryopreservation. This protocol involves treating the hESC colonies with cell dissociation solution, a mild dissociation solution uncommonly used for hESC culture. A recovery ratio ranging from 45. 5 % to 168. 2 % was obtained, and these were significantly different from the other tested conditions (Student's t-test, P < 0. 05). The cryopreserved hESCs were morphologically comparable to control cells, exhibited a good expansion profile, were positive for pluripotent expression markers, and could still differentiate into the 3 germ layers. This new protocol allows efficient and economical hESC cryopreservation, ideal for hESC banking...|$|E
40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSC) {{isolated}} from the peripheral blood (PBSC) are frozen and stored using the same techniques previously developed for bone marrow hematopoietic cells. 1 The general parameters include cryopreservation in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) {{and a source of}} plasma protein with or without <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> (HES), 2, 3 cooling at 1 to 3 o C/minute, and storage at- 80 o C or colder. The major difference for the cryobiologist is the large number of cells collected during apheresis, averaging 4. 3 x 1010 in a series of patients at this center, that complicates cryopreservation of PBSC. Cryopreservation of cells at the concentrations frequently used for bone marrow could result in volumes in excess of 400 ml for each collection. Infusion-related toxicities appear {{to be related to the}} amount of DMSO infused. 4 The maximal tolerated dose of dimethylsulfoxide is not known for humans. The LD 50 of DMSO for dogs has been reported to be 2. 5 gm per kilogram body weight, 5 or about 22 ml/kg of a 10 % DMSO solution. We limit the amount of cryopreserved cells to be infused to 10 ml/kg/day for this reason. Patients with larger volumes will receive the cells over more than 1 day. To minimize the volume infused, we concentrate the cells before cryopreservation. In one series of patients, the average cell concentration of cryopreserved PBSC was 5. 59 x 108 nucleated cells per ml. 6 High concentrations of red cells and platelets were also frozen. We found no detrimental effect of cryopreservation at these high cel...|$|E

Before and 12, 18 and 24 [*]h after starting continuous i. v. endotoxin we measured portal venous and hepatic arterial blood flow, intracapillary haemoglobin O 2 saturation (Hb-O 2 %) {{of the liver}} surface and arterial, portal and hepatic venous lactate, pyruvate, glyercol and alanine concentrations. Glucose production rate {{was derived from the}} plasma isotope enrichment during infusion of [6, 6 - 2 H 2]-glucose. Despite a sustained 50 % increase in cardiac output endotoxin caused a progressive, significant fall in MAP. Liver blood flow significantly increased, but endotoxin affected neither hepatic O 2 delivery and uptake nor mean intracapillary Hb-O 2 % and Hb-O 2 % frequency distributions. Endotoxin nearly doubled endogenous glucose production rate while hepatic lactate, alanine and glycerol uptake rates progressively decreased significantly. The lactate uptake rate even became negative (P< 0. 05 vs Control). Endotoxin caused portal and hepatic venous pH to fall significantly concomitant with significantly increased arterial, portal and hepatic venous lactate/pyruvate ratios. During endotoxic shock increased cardiac output achieved by colloid infusion maintained elevated liver blood flow and thereby macro- and microcirculatory O 2 supply. Glucose production rate nearly doubled with complete dissociation of hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors and glucose release. Despite well-preserved capillary oxygenation increased lactate/pyruvate ratios reflecting impaired cytosolic redox state suggested deranged liver energy balance, possibly due to the O 2 requirements of gluconeogenesis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the inducible nitric oxide synthase activation-induced excess nitric oxide formation on the rate of hepatic glucose production during fully resuscitated murine septic shock. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomized animal study. SETTING: University animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male C 57 Bl/ 6 and B 6. 129 P 2 -Nos 2 (tm 1 Lau) /J (iNOS-/-) mice. INTERVENTIONS: Fifteen hours after cecal ligation and puncture, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and instrumented mice (wild-type controls, n = 13; iNOS-/-, n = 12; wild-type mice receiving 5 mg. kg(- 1) i. p. of the selective iNOS inhibitor GW 274150 immediately after cecal ligation and puncture, n = 8) received continuous i. v. <b>hydroxyethylstarch</b> and norepinephrine to achieve normotensive and hyperdynamic hemodynamics. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measurements were recorded 18, 21 and 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture. Liver microcirculatory perfusion and capillary hemoglobin O 2 saturation (laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectrophotometry) were well maintained in all groups. Despite significantly lower norepinephrine doses required to achieve the hemodynamic targets, the rate of hepatic glucose production (gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry measurements of tissue isotope enrichment during continuous i. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - 13 C 6 -glucose infusion) at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture was significantly higher in both iNOS-/- and GW 274150 -treated mice, which was concomitant with a significantly higher hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (spectrophotometry) in these animals. CONCLUSIONS: In normotensive, hyperdynamic septic shock, both pharmacologic and genetic deletion of the inducible nitric oxide synthase allowed maintenance of hepatic glucose production, most likely due to maintained activity of the key regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase...|$|E
40|$|The hyperosmolar and {{hyperoncotic}} {{properties of}} HyperHaes (HHES) might improve impaired posttraumatic cerebral perfusion. Possible beneficial effects on pericontusional perfusion, brain edema, and contusion volume were investigated in rats subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) anesthetized with isoflurane {{were subjected to}} a left temporoparietal CCI. Thereafter, rats were randomized to receive HHES (10 % <b>hydroxyethylstarch,</b> 7. 5 % NaCl) or physiological saline solution (4 mL/kg body weight) intravenously. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were determined before and following CCI, after drug administration and 24 h later. Regional pericontusional cortical perfusion was determined by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry before CCI, and 30 min, 4 and 24 h after injury. At 24 h brain swelling and water content were measured gravimetrically. At 7 days, cortical contusion volume was determined planimetrically. MABP was not influenced by HHES. ICP was significantly decreased immediately after HHES infusion (5. 7 +/- 0. 4 vs. 7. 1 +/- 1. 0 mm Hg; p < 0. 05). Pericontusional cortical perfusion was significantly decreased by 44 % compared to pre-injury levels (p < 0. 05). HHES significantly improved cortical perfusion at 4 h after CCI, approaching baseline values (85 +/- 12 %). While increased posttraumatic brain edema was not reduced by HHES at 24 h, cortical contusion volume was significantly decreased in the HHES-treated rats at 7 days after CCI (23. 4 +/- 3. 5 vs. 39. 6 +/- 6. 2 mm 3; p < 0. 05). Intravaneous administration of HHES within 15 min after CCI has a neuroprotective potential, as it significantly attenuated impaired pericontusional perfusion and markedly reduced the extent of induced structural damage...|$|E

Methods: 18 Large White pigs underwent total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil. 25 ml/kg of arterial blood were removed from the femoral artery. Volume was replaced, RL, in group 1 (n= 6) and HES 130 / 0. 4, in group 2 (n= 6), 20 min after bleeding. The control group did not face bleeding and volume reposition. One hour after volume replacement, pigs were euthanized with intravenous KCl, and renal tissue samples were taken for several studies, including immunohistochemically with in situ TUNEL method for apoptosis detection. ANOVA was used to compare data between groups. Results: In all groups apoptosis was, as expected, mainly detected in epithelial tubular cells of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, in the loop of Henle and in the epithelium of collecting tubules, however the number of apoptotic cells per mm 2 was lower in group 1 (35. 68 apoptotic cells/mm 2), when compared with group 2 (67. 94 apoptotic cells/mm 2) and the control group (146. 34 apoptotic cells/mm 2). The level of apoptosis was significantly higher in Ringer Lactate group, comparing with controls group, for the epithelial tubular cells (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The median apoptotic levels were significantly lower in pigs, subjected to fluid replacement with RL, when compared with HES 130 / 0. 4.
