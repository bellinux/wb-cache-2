5000|$|Kleitomachos (Greek: Κλειτόμαχος, {{variously}} also transliterated Cleitomachus or Clitomachus) was a Theban athlete {{considered a}} formidable boxer. His achievements were recounted by Pausanias, {{who notes that}} he won the boxing and pankration at the 141st Olympiad in 216 BC, the pankration at three Pythian Games, and the wrestling, boxing, and pankration at an Isthmian Games. This latter achievement, victory in all three so-called [...] "downing" [...] events, was regarded as especially impressive, and was only achieved by one other athlete (Theagenes of Thasos). Aelian praised Kleitomachos for his temperance, holding {{it to be the}} key to his athletic prowess. In particular, he noted Kleitomachos' abstinence from sex, saying that he would even avert his eyes if he saw two <b>dogs</b> <b>coupling.</b>|$|R

60|$|Of {{course it}} is ten times {{criminal}} to tell young children facts about sex, or to implicate them in adult relationships. A child has a strong evanescent sex consciousness. It instinctively writes impossible words on back walls. But {{this is not a}} fully conscious mental act. It is a kind of dream act--quite natural. The child's curious, shadowy, indecent sex-knowledge is quite in the course of nature. And does nobody any harm at all. Adults had far better not notice it. But if a child sees a cockerel tread a hen, or two <b>dogs</b> <b>coupling,</b> well and good. It should see these things. Only, without comment. Let nothing be exaggeratedly hidden. By instinct, let us preserve the decent privacies. But if a child occasionally sees its parent nude, taking a bath, all the better. Or even sitting in the W. C. Exaggerated secrecy is bad. But indecent exposure is also very bad. But worst of all is dragging in the mental consciousness of these shadowy dynamic realities.|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 7. 4 million people in Europe are visually impaired [1]. Limitations of traditional mobility aids (i. e. white canes and guide <b>dogs)</b> <b>coupled</b> with a proliferation of context-aware technologies (e. g. Electronic Travel Aids, Global Positioning Systems and Geographical Information Systems), have stimulated research and development into navigational systems for the visually impaired. However, current research appears very technology focused, {{which has led to}} an insufficient appreciation of Human Computer Interaction, in particular task/requirements analysis and notions of contextual interactions. The study reported here involved a smallscale investigation into how visually impaired people interact with their environmental context during micro-navigation (through immediate environment) and/or macro-navigation (through distant environment) on foot. The purpose was to demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of visually impaired people in interaction with their environmental context. Results from a previous study involving sighted participants were used for comparison. Results revealed that when describing a route, visually impaired people vary in their use of different types of navigation clues - both as a group, when compared with sighted participants, and as individuals. Usability implications and areas for further work are identified and discussed...|$|R

These may be the deployment of specially trained officers - uniformed and plain-clothes, <b>dogs,</b> horses <b>coupled</b> with the heightened use of CCTV. It involves increasing existing levels of community engagement, {{to encourage people to}} be vigilant and to report anything suspicious. It has included media engagement, poster advertisements in transport hubs or in roadside and telephone boxes, as well as leaflets placed in shops and cafes. In each case, the police force concerned, provides the public with telephone numbers to call if they see anything suspicious.|$|R
50|$|The {{track was}} built in 1948 with the {{intention}} of <b>dog</b> racing <b>coupled</b> with parimutuel betting. When gambling was not approved for the county, the plans were scrapped. Despite this setback, the track was converted to auto racing which experienced tremendous growth following the end {{of the end of the}} second World War. The track held one NASCAR Grand National Series event in 1961. Besides stock car racing, Norwood Arena Speedway featured midget and sports car racing, drag racing, and other sporting events between 1948 and 1972, when Norwood Arena Speedway closed at the end of stock car racing season.|$|R

60|$|There existed another {{connection}} betwixt these worthies, {{which had}} alternately a repelling and attractive influence upon their intimacy. Sir Arthur always wished to borrow; Mr. Oldbuck {{was not always}} willing to lend. Mr. Oldbuck, per contra, always wished to be repaid with regularity; Sir Arthur was not always, nor indeed often, prepared to gratify this reasonable desire; and, in accomplishing an arrangement between tendencies so opposite, little miffs would occasionally take place. Still there was a spirit of mutual accommodation upon the whole, and they dragged on like <b>dogs</b> in <b>couples,</b> with some difficulty and occasional snarling, but without absolutely coming to a stand-still or throttling each other.|$|R

40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey of}} 200 healthy, mature dogs {{was made to}} determine Brucella canis infectivity rates. The 9 per cent rate reported in the stray dogs was significantly higher (0. 05 less than P greater than 0. 025) than the 1 per cent rate found in pet <b>dogs.</b> These rates <b>coupled</b> with a predictably growing stray dog population have patent zoonotic implications...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the treacherous}} {{conditions}} in which this breed of <b>dog</b> was used, <b>coupled</b> with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "interspecies family" [...] {{refers to}} a group {{consisting}} {{of at least two}} members of different species who deeply care for each other. Examples include a human and their <b>dog,</b> a <b>couple</b> and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family. For instance, [...] "interspecies family" [...] may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a [...] "pet", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership.|$|R

25|$|A genetic {{discrimination}} is possible but difficult, {{since there are}} only a few genetic characteristics that differentiate dingoes from other domestic <b>dogs.</b> A <b>couple</b> of years ago, some scientists from the University of New South Wales developed a relatively reliable method with 20 genetic “fingerprints” using DNA from skin and blood samples to determine the “purity” of a dingo. If one of these “fingerprints” would be found, this would indicate that the examined dog is possibly a hybrid and not a “pure” dingo. The reference group for this test was a group of captive dingoes, thought to cover the whole range of the dingo population. Samples that lay outside of this range would be regarded as hybrids. With increasing development this method might be possible to use on hair and scat samples and provide more exact results.|$|R
40|$|Ground-nesting birds like lapwings and {{sandpipers}} {{constitute a}} major hazard at airports. Preliminary observations with the Israeli Air Force showed that stone curlew (Burhinusoedicnemus, (Burhinidea)) {{were involved in}} 33 % of all bird strikes in 2003 at Hatzor Air Force base in central Israel, most of which occurred during the nesting season. The ultimate reduction of curlew populations near the runways is dependent upon understanding the effect of predation risks on the curlew nesting behavior. In theory, true predation and artificial predation {{should have the same}} effect on bird behavior. We studied the effect of egg collection vs. egg collection complemented with “predation” by Border collies to determine if the harassment by the dogs resulted in a higher or faster rate of abandonment of nests on airfields, by placing the disappearance of a ground-nesting bird’s eggs into the context of predation. Harassment by Border collies on most other ground-nesting species actually avoids the entire problem associated by nesting on the airfield by quickly and effectively eliminating the presence of the ground-nesting species, precluding any nesting behavior in the first place. However, the limitations of the habitat of IAF airbases and the superb camouflaged nature of stone curlews result in the delayed discovery of nests on IAF airfields. The limitation a female curlew has on the number of eggs it can lay each season may ultimately have two contradictory results on nest abandonment. If the amount of eggs is small and fixed, harassment with <b>dogs</b> <b>coupled</b> with egg removal would be expected to yield a shorter nesting season. On the other hand, if the amount of eggs is high, harassment might actually increase the total number of clutches per nesting pair and prolong the nesting season (and hence the time spent on the airfield). We discovered that the amount of eggs female curlews can lay in a season is at least twice higher than reported in literature and varies tremendously between individuals. Nevertheless, harassed curlews abandoned nests at significantly higher rates compared with curlews that lost eggs by strict removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{central to}} {{this study is that}} distinctly Aboriginal patterns of relationship between humans and dogs are still evident in contemporary Aboriginal groups. The relationship's sociological characteristics in traditional and contemporary settings and its implications for canine and human health are also investigated. Field research employing survey, quantitative observation and specimen analysis techniques was conducted in 9 Western Australian Aboriginal groups of various backgrounds and settings. Results were compared to historic-traditional accounts and dog ownership studies in non-Aboriginal groups. Traditionally dogs served Aboriginals most importantly for supernatural protection and to assist the collection of small game by women. In non-isolated groups, traditional utilitarian motives were superseded by the Western concept of dogs as companions. Demographically, the Aboriginal dog populations surveyed were relatively large, and most dogs were classified as medium sized non-descript cross-breds. Dogs were more commonly owned by adult and aged individuals, rather than by family units as is the Western cultural norm. Most dogs remained with their original owner and retained their original name for life. Traditional values of respect towards dogs were compromised to the discriminatory care of higher status animals only, effecting selection pressure against undesirable dogs, particularly females. Similarly, while many aged people were opposed to culling, most respondents regarded community pup production as excessive and accepted culling as necessary. Nevertheless prevention was the preferred option, with strong support for the previously unfamiliar concept of ovariohysterectomy. Pups were raised in some respects like children in the traditional manner, indulgence giving way in adulthood to expectations of self-reliance rather than obedience. Most dogs were in good physical and psychological condition, though more likely to be afflicted by sarcoptic mange than other Australian dogs. Other parasites occurred at or below expected frequencies. Close physical contact with <b>dogs</b> <b>coupled</b> with favourable microclimates allowed ample opportunity for transmission of canine zoonoses, but the actual risk to human health remains poorly documented...|$|R
