25|$|During the 1973–74 winter season, Clarksons's plight worsened. At the time, the UK {{was in the}} <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recession, as {{a result}} of the early 1970s energy crisis caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil boycott of the West in the {{aftermath}} of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. This was a punitive measure directed against these countries for their support of Israel during that war. It led to a drastic reduction in the availability of petroleum products — including jet fuel. This in turn resulted in a tripling of the oil price in October 1973 and a subsequent quadrupling.|$|E
25|$|Stars at {{the centre}} of the Milky Way are so densely packed that special imaging {{techniques}} (such as adaptive optics) were needed to boost the resolution of the VLT. Thanks to these techniques, astronomers were able to watch individual stars with unprecedented accuracy as they circled the Galactic Center. Their paths conclusively demonstrated that they were orbiting in the immense gravitational <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supermassive black hole nearly three million times more massive than the sun. The VLT observations also revealed flashes of infrared light emerging from the region at regular intervals. While the cause of this phenomenon is unknown, observers have suggested that the black hole may be spinning rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Compared to autoloading handguns, a {{revolver}} is often much simpler to operate {{and may have}} greater reliability. For example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing. With {{a revolver}}, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a double-action design, by just squeezing the trigger. Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with small hands. A revolver's grip does not hold a magazine, {{and it can be}} designed or customized much more than the <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical semi-automatic. Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt {{showed the}} letter he had {{received}} from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had {{to bring him back}} to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in Jena under the direction of Otto Binswanger. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of Twilight of the Idols, by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian Julius Langbehn attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of Nietzsche contra Wagner, but the publisher C. G. Naumann secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing The Antichrist and Ecce Homo because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.|$|E

25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; in the <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E

500|$|Saville {{was still}} keen to include Dylan, so – {{together}} with Jones – re-structured the play to create two characters {{out of the}} original one that Dylan had been hired to perform. Actor David Warner was hired to play the main acting role of Lennie, while Dylan performed songs commenting on the action {{in the manner of}} a Greek chorus as the new character Bobby, essentially playing himself. At the conclusion of the play, Dylan performed [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", one of the first major public performances of the song. The play was planned to be recorded in one session on 30 December 1962, but it overran and the Technical Operating Manager told cast and crew to go home, even though they were willing to complete the filming. London was in the <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major blizzard and it was not possible to arrange a further session until 4 January 1963, when the play was completed, and it was transmitted on 13 January 1963.|$|E
500|$|From its beginning, the Sunday Expresss {{campaign}} {{drew the}} attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the Sunday Chronicle, The People and Truth. The Daily News and Westminster Gazette ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel [...] "present as a martyr {{a woman in the}} <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vice". Most of the British press defended The Well. The Nation suggested that the Sunday Express had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic silly season when good stories are scarce. Country Life and Lady's Pictorial both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, called Douglas a [...] "stunt journalist"; he said no one would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Waugh sailed on the SS Staffordshire, {{bound for}} Ceylon. He hoped on the voyage {{to find the}} peace that would enable him to finish his stalled book. On board, his strange {{behaviour}} became an increasing concern to his fellow-passengers, and the letters which {{he wrote to his}} wife Laura from the ship alarmed her—Waugh appeared to be in the <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> persecution mania in which he was beset by threatening, malevolent voices. He left the ship at Alexandria and flew on to Ceylon, but the voices continued to harass him. He wrote to Laura: [...] "Everything I say or think or read is read aloud by the group of psychologists whom I met in the ship... the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away". Laura arranged for her friend Jack Donaldson to fly out with her to Colombo to bring Waugh home, but before they could do so Waugh returned to London of his own volition. There he was persuaded by his friend, the Jesuit priest Philip Caraman, to accept treatment from Eric Strauss, the head of psychiatry at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Strauss quickly diagnosed that Waugh's delusions arose from poisoning by his sleeping drugs, and substituted paraldehyde for chloral. The hallucinations disappeared immediately, and Waugh recovered his senses.|$|E
