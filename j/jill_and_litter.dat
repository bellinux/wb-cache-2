50|$|HistoryChase {{arrived on}} the scene when <b>Jill</b> Foster Abbott <b>and</b> Katherine Chancellor hired and paid him to get Nina Webster out of Phillip Chancellor III's life. <b>Jill</b> <b>and</b> Kay could not stand Nina, who kept {{pursuing}} Phillip and became pregnant with his son, Chance. Chase Benson's job was to keep Nina occupied while <b>Jill</b> <b>and</b> Kay sought custody of Chance, but Nina ended things with Chase after she learned that he was working with <b>Jill</b> <b>and</b> Kay. While escorting Nina, Chase fell for Christine Blair, who did not trust him at all before the truth came out about him working for <b>Jill</b> <b>and</b> Kay. After the chaos with <b>Jill,</b> Kay <b>and</b> Nina was over, Chase went from being a bad guy to a good guy and became friends with Nina, Christine and Danny Romalotti. Chase was hired at Jabot Cosmetics by Jack Abbott to work in the advertising department. Chase later began flirting with Lauren Fenmore, but he stopped after learning that she was the CEO of Fenmore's Department Stores. In 1990, Chase was fixed up with a woman named Vivian, who was later murdered by David Kimble. Chase was last seen in early 1991.|$|R

40|$|The {{forest floor}} is an {{important}} part of carbon storage, biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and fire fuel hazard. This paper reports on a study of <b>litter</b> <b>and</b> duff layers of the forest floor for eastern U. S. forests. The U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) program currently measures variables related to duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> on a subsample of plots covering all U. S. forest lands regardless of ownership. The FIA soils protocol includes duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> thickness measurement <b>and</b> sample collection followed by lab measurement of mass and carbon content. We examined these lab data to test a model of duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> carbon storage based upon simple measurements of forest floor depth. Duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> data were compiled from 1, 468 plots sampled in 2001 and 2002 from most states in the eastern U. S. These data were combined with other available FIA data for regression modeling to predict duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> carbon from depth of duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> layer <b>and</b> several other classification variables (R 2 = 0. 56). Results on duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> model predictions show that duff <b>and</b> <b>litter</b> are an important carbon sink in eastern U. S. forests by containing about 50 percent of the forest floor carbon or 10 percent of total forest carbon (excluding mineral soil). ______________________________________________________________________...|$|R
