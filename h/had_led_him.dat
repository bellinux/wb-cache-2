25|$|Menon {{concluded}} that due to, among other things, the Committee's manner of questioning, carelessness in evaluating evidence, {{and failure to}} allow witnesses a chance to defend their testimony, it had descended into the arena. Accordingly, he held that the application could be allowed on this alternative basis as well. He stressed {{that it was the}} totality of the circumstances, and not any particular fact, that <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to this conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Even though Arnold was {{nominated}} for the 1974 Fields Medal, which was then viewed as the highest honour a mathematician could receive, interference from the Soviet government led to it being withdrawn. Arnold's public opposition to the persecution of dissidents <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> into direct conflict with influential Soviet officials, and he suffered persecution himself, including not being allowed to leave the Soviet Union {{during most of the}} 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Hausdorff's general {{products}} and powers of cardinalities <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> {{to the concept}} of partially ordered set. The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem. This is the Hausdorff maximal principle. It follows not only from the well-ordering theorem (or from the (equivalent to this) axiom of choice), but it is, as it turned out, even to the axiom of choice are equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Huysmans' {{work was}} known for his {{idiosyncratic}} use of the French language, extensive vocabulary, detailed and sensuous descriptions, and biting, satirical wit. It also displays an encyclopaedic erudition, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in À rebours to the discussion of the iconography of Christian architecture in La cathédrale. Huysmans expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism. This <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Later he returned to the Catholic Church, as noted in his Durtal novels.|$|E

25|$|Degas painted Interior at a {{time when}} his growing {{commitment}} to Realism <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> away from his earlier preoccupation with historical subjects such as Sémiramis Building Babylon (1860–62), Young Spartans Exercising (ca.1860), and the painting which marked his Salon debut, Scene of War in the Middle Ages (1865). His new direction was apparent by the time he exhibited Steeplechase—The Fallen Jockey in the Salon of 1866. Degas probably intended to submit Interior for exhibition in the Salon of 1869, but it was not shown publicly until June 1905, when it was displayed at Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Huysmans' work is {{considered}} remarkable for its idiosyncratic {{use of the}} French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of À rebours. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in La cathédrale (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral {{as the focus of}} the book.|$|E
25|$|In {{answer to}} Kingsley, again {{encouraged}} by Badeley, Newman published in bi-monthly parts his Apologia Pro Vita Sua, a religious autobiography of abiding interest. Its tone changed the popular estimate of its author, by explaining the convictions which <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> into the Catholic Church. Kingsley's general accusation against the Catholic clergy is dealt with {{later in the}} work; his specific accusations are addressed in an appendix. Newman maintains that English Catholic priests {{are at least as}} truthful as English Catholic laymen. Newman published a revision of the series of pamphlets in book form in 1865; in 1913 a combined critical edition, edited by Wilfrid Ward, was published.|$|E

25|$|The main {{proponent of}} the Reformation in Switzerland was Ulrich Zwingli, whose actions during the Affair of the Sausages are now {{considered}} to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland. His own studies, in the renaissance humanist tradition, <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to preach against injustices and hierarchies in the Church already in 1516 while he was still a priest in Einsiedeln. When he was called to Zürich, he expanded his criticism also onto political topics and in particular condemned the mercenary business. His ideas were received favourably, especially by entrepreneurs, businessmen, and the guilds. The first disputation of Zürich of 1523 was the breakthrough: the city council decided to implement his reformatory plans and to convert to Protestantism.|$|E
25|$|The first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge, {{was held}} on Christmas Eve in 1918. It was {{introduced}} by Eric Milner-White, the Dean of the College, whose experience as an army chaplain <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to believe that more imaginative worship was needed by the Church of England. The order of service was adapted from the order created by Benson for Truro Cathedral 38 years earlier, {{which was based on}} an idea of George Walpole, at the time Succentor of Truro Cathedral, and the future Bishop of Edinburgh. The first service at King's largely followed Benson's original plan, including the Benedictions before each reading, several of which were later amalgamated by Milner-White into his Bidding Prayer.|$|E
25|$|In Moldavia, in December 1855, {{following}} a proposal by Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a bill drafted by Mihail Kogălniceanu and Petre Mavrogheni {{was adopted by}} the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (that is, citizens). The measure was brought about by a personal tragedy: Ghica and the public opinion at large were scandalized when Dincă, the slave and illegitimate child of a Cantacuzino boyar, was not allowed to marry his French mistress and go free, which <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to murder his lover and kill himself. The owners would receive a compensation of 8 galbeni for lingurari and vătraşi and 4 galbeni for lăieşi, the money being provided by the taxes paid by previously freed slaves.|$|E

The band was joined by Josh Klinghoffer, who to the public was still the band's backup touring guitarist, {{although}} it was later confirmed, that he was already an official member and Frusciante's replacement with Frusciante having quit the band on July 29, 2009. An official announcement on Frusciante's departure wasn't made until December 2009. Frusciante explained on his MySpace page, {{that there was no}} drama or anger about him leaving the band this time, and that the other members were very supportive and understanding. Frusciante said he felt his musical interests <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> in a different direction, and that he needed to fully focus his efforts on his solo career.|$|E
25|$|In 1597, {{the queen}} {{seems to have}} promised Buck the {{reversion}} (the right to succeed to an office when it next fell vacant) {{of the office of}} Master of the Revels. The office was held at the time by Buck's relation by marriage, Edmund Tilney. The playwright John Lyly, however, believed that since about 1585 Queen Elizabeth <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to expect appointment to the post. He was vocal in his distress, writing letters of protest and supplication. The reversion was formally conferred on Buck in 1603, on the accession to the throne of King James I. Also upon the accession of James I, Buck was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and knighted. At the same time, he inherited his aunt's lands in Lincolnshire. In 1606, he began to license plays for publication.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{hostilities}} {{with the}} Ottomans had ceased momentarily in 1614 with the Iranian army at its acme, Abbas I sent in his troops against the Georgian kingdoms. This {{time he was}} aided by the Georgian nobleman, Giorgi Saakadze, an able fighter who had formerly enjoyed much influence {{in the service of}} Luarsab II of Kartli until a threat to his life <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to defect to the shah. The Iranians drove both Teimuraz and Luarsab from their realms into the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti, and Abbas I replaced them with Georgian converts to Islam. Bagrat VII was installed in Kartli, while Kakheti was given to Teimuraz’s cousin Isa Khan. George III of Imereti, under the Ottoman protection, refused to give up the refugees and the shah retaliated by giving Kartli and Kakheti over to his troops for pillage. Then Luarsab chose to surrender, but rejected the shah's request to renounce Christianity. Abbas exiled him to Iran and had him strangled at Shiraz in 1622.|$|E

25|$|During the Battle of North Anna, the Third Corps was {{positioned}} on the Confederate left. On May 23rd, Wilcox's division attacked the V Corps {{as it was}} crossing the North Anna near Jericho Mill; faulty intelligence <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to believe that only two Union cavalry brigades had crossed the river. Wilcox launched his attack about 6 p.m. and initially routed two Union brigades but was driven back by a Union counterattack before Confederate reinforcements arrived. Wilcox lost 730 men while inflicting only 338 casualties on the Union forces. During {{the rest of the}} battle, the corps was engaged in only brief skirmishing. At Cold Harbor, Hill was stationed on the Confederate left flank but on June 2 Mahone's and Wilcox's divisions were moved to the Confederate right in response to the movements of the Union II Corps; Heth's division remained on the left. On June 3rd, an attack by the Union II Corps briefly overran part of the Confederate line to Hill's left but the Florida Brigade counterattacked an recaptured the line.|$|E
25|$|O'Hehir {{subsequently}} {{became a}} staple of the BBC's coverage of the famous annual Grand National steeplechase. He would invariably pick up the commentary at the Becher's Brook fence and take the race to Valentine's Brook, a vital section of the race where many a favourite fell. Foinavon's famous victory in 1967 will be remembered as one of O'Hehir's finest moments in racing commentaries and won him great respect for the speed and smoothness with which he picked out the unconsidered outsider. O'Hehir later confessed {{in an interview that he}} it had been his inability to identify the colours on his card when inspecting the riders silks in the weighing room prior to the race that <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to question rider John Buckingham who his mount was. Buckingham advised O'Hehir that Foinavon's silks had been changed at the last minute as his regular green colours were considered unlucky. It was because of this chance meeting that he was able to identify the 100/1 outsider and carry the commentary.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds felt {{qualified}} {{to write the}} volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge {{of the law of}} military government working with Professor L. F. L. Oppenheim (30 March 1858 – 7 October 1919) in 1912 on The Laws and Usages of War and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at Walworth in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able to glean plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General Charles Fergusson (17 January 1865 – 20 February 1951), a former military governor of Cologne, said that he disliked Field Marshal William Robertson (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) and that the enmity <b>had</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to resign, despite being on good terms with General Herbert Plumer (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932).|$|E
