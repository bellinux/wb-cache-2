40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{measuring}} the solar age {{by means of}} helioseismology has been recently revisited by Guenther & Demarque (1997) and by Weiss & Schlattl (1998). Different best values for tseis and different assessment of the uncertainty resulted from these two works. We show that depending on the way seismic data are used, one may obtain tseis ≈ 4. 6 Gy close {{to the age of}} the oldest meteorites, tmet = 4. 57 Gy, like in the first paper, or above 5 Gy like in the second paper. The discrepancy in the seismic estimates of the solar age may be eliminated by assuming higher than the standard metal abundance and/or an upward revision of the opacities in the solar radiative interior. We argue that the most accurate and robust seismic measure of the solar age are the small <b>frequency</b> <b>separations,</b> Dℓ,n = νl,n − νℓ+ 2,n− 1, for spherical harmonic degrees ℓ = 0, 2 and radial orders n ≫ ℓ. The seismic age inferred by minimization of the sum of squared differences between the model and the solar small separations is tseis = 4. 66 ± 0. 11 Gy, a number consistent with meteoritic data. Our analysis supports earlier suggestions of using small <b>frequency</b> <b>separations</b> as stellar age indicators...|$|R

50|$|However, {{instead of}} square pulses as OQPSK uses, MSK encodes each bit as a half sinusoid. This {{results in a}} constant-modulus signal (constant {{envelope}} signal), which reduces problems caused by non-linear distortion.

40|$|Rapid visual flicker {{is known}} to capture {{attention}}. Here we show slow flicker can also capture attention under reciprocal temporal conditions. Observers searched for a target line (vertical or horizontal) among tilted distractors. Distractor lines were surrounded by luminance modulating annuli, all flickering sinusoidally at 1. 3 or 12. 1 [*]Hz, while the target’s annulus flickered at frequencies within this range. Search times improved with increasing target/distractor frequency differences. For target–distractor <b>frequency</b> <b>separations</b> > 5 [*]Hz reaction times were minimal with high-frequency targets correctly identified more rapidly than low frequency targets (~ 400 [*]ms). Critically, however, at these optimal <b>frequency</b> <b>separations</b> search times for low and high-frequency targets were unaffected by set size (slow flicker popped out from high flicker, and vice versa), indicating parallel and symmetric search performance when searching for high or low frequency targets. In a “cost” experiment using 1. 3 and 12. 1 [*]Hz flicker, the unique flickering annulus sometimes surrounded a distractor and, on other trials, surrounded the target. When centered on a distractor, the unique frequency produced a clear and symmetrical search cost. Together, these symmetric pop-out and search costs demonstrate that temporal frequency is a pre-attentive visual feature capable of capturing attention, {{and that it is}} relative rather than absolute frequencies that are critical. The shape of the search functions strongly suggest that early visual temporal frequency filters underlie these effects...|$|R
