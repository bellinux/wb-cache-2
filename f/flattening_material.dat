40|$|The medial {{nucleus of}} the {{trapezoid}} body has been studied electron microscopically in two species of bat, Miniopterus schreibersi fuliginosus and Vespertilio superans, which were perfused with three different kinds of fixatives, osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehydc, and formaldehyde. Two types of synaptic endings are observed in the nucleus: the abundant calyciferous endings and the less frequently occurring "small-vesicle endings. " The former endings vary greatly in size, and contain extended extracellular spaces between pro- and postsynaptic membranes. The latter endings are always small, without the extended extracellular spaces, and tend to lie side by side. In all of the materials perfused with three different fxatives, synaptic vesicles in the calyciferous endings arc round in shape and larger {{than those in the}} small-vesicle endings. The shape of vesicles in the small-vesicle endings varies according to the kinds of fixatives used; round in osmium tetroxidc-fixed <b>materials,</b> <b>flattened</b> in formaldehyde-fixed <b>materials,</b> and somewhat round or <b>flattened</b> in glutaraldehyde-fixed <b>materials.</b> It is suggested that the calycifcrous endings arc excitatory in nature and that the small-vesicle endings are inhibitory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{the first full}} taxonomic treatment of graptolites from the Middle Ordovician (Llanvirn) Table Head and Goose Tickle groups of western Newfoundland. These rocks represent the upper portion of an autochthonous sedimentary and volcanic sequence that was deposited in a shallow water, near-shore environment during the rifting and passive drifting of the continental margin. Seventeen taxa from these strata are discussed in detail, based almost exclusively on <b>flattened</b> <b>material,</b> including Glossograptus sp. nov. Specimen preservation is best in the Port au Port region, quality decreasing {{to the east and}} the north. [...] There is good correlation between graptolite assemblages at the various exposures of the Table Cove and Black Cove formations, but there appears to be insufficient vertical change through the sequences to permit faunal subdivision of this interval (equivalent to the Australian Darriwilian 3). [...] The graptolite assemblages found in these rocks suggest a low latitude, warm water setting (Pacific Province) at the time of formation. However, the increased number of pandemic species compared to neighbouring Early Ordovician (Arenig) sequences in western Newfoundland suggests that provincialism was becoming less pronounced at this time...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method were developed for providing a uniform, consolidated, unidirectional, continuous, fiber-reinforced polymeric material. The apparatus comprises a supply means, a forming means, a shaping means, and a take-up means. The forming means further comprises a pre-melting chamber and a stationary bar assembly. The shaping means is a loaded cooled nip-roller apparatus. Forming takes place by heating a polymeric prepreg material to a temperature where the polymer becomes viscous and applying pressure gradients at separate locations along the prepreg material. Upon exiting the forming means, the polymeric prepreg material is malleable, consolidated, and flattened. Shaping takes place by passing the malleable, consolidated, <b>flattened</b> prepreg <b>material</b> through a shaped, matched groove in a loaded, cooled nip-roller apparatus {{to provide the}} final solid product...|$|R

[...] The resulting centrifugal force tends to <b>flatten</b> the star; <b>material</b> can {{be lost in the}} loosely bound equatorial regions, allowing for the formation of a disk. The spectroscopic observations seem to confirm this, and the star is classified as Oe, possibly due to emission from such an equatorial disk of gas.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEfforts on the {{generation}} of intensified magnetic flux have been made for the optimized shape of HTS winding applications. This contributes to the high efficiency of the rotating machines using HTS windings. Heat generation from the HTS windings requires to be suppressed as much as possible, when those coils are under operation with either direct or alternative currents. Presently, the reduction of such thermal loss generated by the applied currents on the HTS coils is reported with a magnetic flux deflection system. The HTS coils are fixed together with <b>flattened</b> magnetic <b>materials</b> to realize a kind of redirection of the flux pathway. Eventually, the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the tape surface (equivalent to the a-b plane) of the HTS tape materials is reduced to {{the proximity of the}} HTS coil. To verify the new geometry of the surroundings of the HTS coils with magnetic materials, a comparative study of the DC coil voltage was done for different applied currents in prototype field-pole coils of a ship propulsion motor...|$|R
40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{has always been}} an {{important}} sector of the metal industry thanks to work hardening, however complex set of deformation entails evolution of damage in the material through the forming stages. With an outlook to cold recycling of sheet metals, this paper focuses on experimental quantification of damage and degradation in load carrying capacity due to forming process. Assuming that cold recycling of sheet metals involves an intermediate flattening prior to secondary forming process, the adverse effects of <b>flattening</b> on <b>material</b> was also investigated. An industrial cold roll forming process was taken as case study. Experimental investigation using microhardness mapping on the cross-section of fold zones, in conjunction with 3 D global-local FE modelling were the basis of through-thickness damage analysis. Taking advantage of strain-hardness correlation a new method was established to extrapolate hardness for ductile damage characterization. Investigation on sensitivity of the measured microhardness to crystallographic texture and sample surface preparation backed the experimental results. The results particularly outlined the progressive decrease in load carrying capacity of material after forming and after flattening. The possibility of a secondary manufacturing process is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of laminated films with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to <b>flatten</b> the <b>materials</b> for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process. Laminated films made from extrusion lamination process provided lower level of achievable heat seal strength when compared with the laminated films made from dry-bond lamination proces...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect to}} engineering {{in the workplace}} {{is the ability to}} design solutions to ill-structured problems. Prior research has shown that such solutions are highly effective when they are evaluated in relation to multiple design concepts. However, a documented problem among engineering students is that they tend to fixate on their initial design ideas rather than branching out and continuing to develop new concepts. In order {{to address the issue of}} fixation, 77 Design Heuristics has been established as a method to cultivate ideation among engineers and engineering students. This method for generating design concepts comes in the form of 77 cards, each with a different cognitive prompt for generating a solution (e. g., reduce <b>material,</b> <b>flatten).</b> Through the use of the 77 cards, engineers and engineering students are able to expand their horizons of possible design ideas and develop many unique concepts. Using a freshman engineering course, we integrated the 77 Design Heuristic cards to document how initial ideas develop into final concepts. We analyzed 12 first-year engineering students that were distributed in three different design teams, in order to better understand how they responded to the use of this instructional tool. Our findings demonstrate key influences that did foster idea fluency (Theme 1 : Influence on Design Concepts) but also ways that students attached to certain concepts throughout the design process (Theme 2 : Resilient Concepts).

40|$|Aim of Study: The {{purpose of}} this study was to report the dosimetric {{characteristics}} of the small fields in flattening filter free (FFF) beams (output measurements, profile analysis, surface dose and consistency) generated by medical linear accelerator and its variation with respect to <b>flattened</b> beams (FB). <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Surface doses were obtained for field sizes 1 × 1 - 40 × 40 cm 2. Field width and penumbra were analyzed for field sizes 1 × 1 - 40 × 40 cm 2. To take output factors for small fields, diode and micro chamber were used and data was taken at a source-to-surface distance (SSD) and extended SSD. Consistency checked for the dosimetric data for 1 year. Results: Surface doses were higher in FFF compared with FB up to 20 × 20 cm 2 field size. Measured field sizes were slightly lesser in FFF and penumbra values were increased with respect to field size in both FB and FFF. For small fields, diode values have shown more promising results than micro chamber. Small field output measurements at nominal SSD and extended SSD were well in agreement with each other. FFF beams showed good data consistency in 1 year duration. Conclusion: Small field dosimetry, surface dose, profile analysis and consistency of FFF beams in FFF photon beams were derived and data shown good consistency during 1 year duration...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} ability of the TG- 119 {{commissioning}} process and the IROC credentialing to detect errors in the commissioning process for a commercial treatment planning system. Methods: We introduced commissioning errors into the commissioning process for the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) within the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (TPS). We included errors in MLC Dosimetric Leaf Gap (DLG), electron contamination modeling parameters, incorrect <b>flattening</b> filter <b>material,</b> and beam profile measurement with an inappropriately large farmer chamber (simulated using sliding window smoothing of the input dose profiles). We evaluated the clinical impact of these errors for a variety of clinical intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans by looking at PTV D 99 and mean and max dose to OARs. The different cases included a head and neck plan, low and intermediate risk prostate plans, a lung plan, and a scalp plan. Finally, for the errors with substantial clinical impact, we determined the sensitivity of the commissioning & credentialing processes with the TG 119 C-shape and RPC IMRT head and neck phantoms. This was determined by comparing plans before and after commissioning errors were introduced in the commissioning process using the technique suggested by each respective organization. IROC IMRT credentialing includes film analysis at the midpoint between PTV and OAR using a 4 mm distance to agreement metric along with a 7 % TLD dose comparison. The TG 119 C-shape IMRT phantom looks at 3 separate dose planes and using gamma criteria of 3 % 3 mm. Results: The most clinically significant commissioning errors came from large changes in the MLC DLG with a change of 1 mm resulting in up to a 5 % change in the primary PTV D 99. This resulted in a discrepancy in the IROC TLDs in the PTVs and OARs of 7. 1 % and 13. 6 % respectively, which would have resulted in detection. While use of incorrect flattening filter caused only subtle errors (6 %). Conclusion: The AAA commissioning process within the Eclipse TPS is surprisingly robust to user error. When errors do occur, the IROC and T 119 commissioning credentialing criteria are effective at detecting them; however the OAR TLDs are the most sensitive to errors despite the IROC currently excluding them from their analysis.

40|$|The {{development}} of digital fabrication has reintroduced material processes with digital processes.  There {{has been much}} discussion about the tool and the objects of the tool, but little discussion of the implication of the material process on the digital process.  A brief historical review on the {{development of}} computer numerical control and the origins of the Büzier curve reveals an instrumental fact:  computer numerical controlled tools necessitated advancements in computational surfaces which eventually led to NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces.   In other words, the origins of NURBS surfaces resides in its relation to material processes, rather than many current approaches that develop free form surfaces and then force the tool onto the material without regard to the material properties.   From this historical and mathematical review, this project develops toward more intelligent construction methods based on the integration of NURBS differential geometry paired with material qualities and processes. Specifically, a digital technique of developing conceptual NURBS geometry into piecewise surface patches are then flattened based on the material thickness and density. From these <b>flattened</b> patches, a <b>material</b> technique is developed to intelligently remove material to allow the rigid flat material to re-develop into physical surface patches.  The goal of this research is to develop digital and material techniques toward intelligent construction based on the correspondence between digitally driven surface and digitally driven material processes.

50|$|The Roll Out Solar Array, {{known as}} ROSA, is a solar array {{designed}} by NASA. This {{new type of}} solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays. Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays. It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff composite <b>material,</b> <b>flattened</b> and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.|$|R
40|$|A long-standing {{open issue}} of the {{paradigm}} of low-mass star formation is the luminosity problem: most protostars are less luminous than theoretically predicted. One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU Ori-type stars (FUors) {{are thought to be}} the visible examples for objects in the high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes, which replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion outbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics in FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk happens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V 346 Nor at 1. 3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density and velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found that V 346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a prominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central ∼ 700 au, the circumstellar matter forms a <b>flattened</b> pseudo-disk where <b>material</b> is infalling with conserved angular momentum. Within ∼ 350 au, the velocity profile is more consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 0. 1 M_. We determined an infall rate from the envelope onto the disk of 6 × 10 ^- 6 M_yr^- 1, a factor of few higher than the quiescent accretion rate from the disk onto the star, hinting for a mismatch between the infall and accretion rates as the cause of the eruption.

40|$|Background: Stereotactic body {{radiotherapy}} (SBRT) using {{flattening filter}} free (FFF) -techniques has been increasingly applied {{during the last}} years. However, clinical studies investigating this emerging technique are still rare. Hence, we analyzed toxicity and clinical outcome of pulmonary SBRT with FFF-techniques and performed dosimetric comparison to conventional techniques using <b>flattening</b> filters (FF). <b>Materials</b> and methods: Between 05 / 2014 and 06 / 2015, 56 consecutive patients with 61 pulmonary lesions were treated with SBRT in FFF-mode. Central lesions received 8 [*]×[*] 7. 5  Gy delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 %-isodose, while peripheral lesions were treated with 3 [*]×[*] 15  Gy, prescribed to the 65 %-isodose. Early and late toxicity (after 6  months) as well as initial clinical outcomes were evaluated. Furthermore, [deleted] plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, beam- on and total treatment delivery times in comparison to plans with FF-dose application. Results: Median follow-up time was 9. 3  months (range 1. 5 – 18. 0  months). Early toxicity was low with only 5 patients (8. 9  %) reporting CTCAE 2 ° or higher side-effects. Only one patient (1. 8  %) was diagnosed with radiation-induced pneumonitis CTCAE 3 °, while 2 (3. 6  %) patients suffered from pneumonitis CTCAE 2 °. After 6  months, no toxicity greater than CTCAE 2 ° was reported. 1 -year local progression-free survival, distant progression-free survival and overall survival were 92. 8  %, 78. 0  %, and 94. 4  %, respectively. While plan quality was similar for FFF- and FF-plans in respect to conformity (p[*]=[*] 0. 275), median beam-on {{time as well as}} total treatment time were significantly reduced for SBRT in FFF-mode compared to FF-mode (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001, p[*]≤[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Robust {{adhesion}} of polymers {{is necessary}} for applications in many industries; however, adhesion is poorly understood on a molecular level. Here, a surface and interface-sensitive nonlinear optical technique, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was used to study polymer adhesive surfaces and polymer/adhesive interfaces {{to gain a better}} understanding of polymer adhesion mechanisms. Silane adhesion promoters are often used to enhance the adhesion of elastomeric materials to polymer substrates. The interfacial structures of a known silane adhesion promoting mixture at polymer/liquid, silicone elastomer/liquid and polymer/silicone elastomer buried interfaces were studied with SFG and correlated to adhesion testing results. The silane adhesion promoters exhibited orientational order at all buried interfaces, implying that interfacial ordering of silane adhesion promoters may be necessary to enhance adhesion. Silane adhesion promoters cannot be used in microfluidics fabrication. In these applications, surface treatments are used to oxidize the silicone surface prior to adhesion, but due to hydrophohbic recovery these effects are temporary. Hydrophobic recovery can be slowed by removing extractable short chain oligomers from the silicone bulk. SFG analysis of silicone surfaces before and after extractable materials were removed showed that the silicone surface methyl group orientation changed after extractions. Also, the surface <b>flattened</b> after extractable <b>materials</b> were removed. These changes in surface structure may slow hydrophobic recovery, and therefore improve adhesion enhancement by oxidative surface treatments. Lastly, the adhesion of a different class of polymer adhesives, epoxy resins, was investigated. Epoxy resins are used as underfills in flip-chip devices, and adhesion failure of underfills can cause the flip-chip device to fail. Here, SFG was used to study the surface structures of model epoxy compounds before cure, after cure and after moisture exposure. Surface structural changes were observed for all three conditions, which may affect adhesion of epoxy underfills. Further, the buried interfacial structures of the cured epoxies and a model polymer were investigated before and after moisture exposure and correlated to adhesion testing results. These studies showed that SFG is a powerful technique to study polymer adhesion mechanisms and the surface and interfacial structures required for adhesion...|$|R
