500|$|Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on {{a one-year}} {{contract}} following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am back <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I {{want to do the}} same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|Declan Ganley, Libertas leader, {{said the}} {{unexpectedly}} high Yes vote demonstrated [...] "how scared people are" [...] {{of the state}} of the economy.
