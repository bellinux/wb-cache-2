5000|$|Jack McMullen, one of WMBS' pioneers, who {{completed}} an 18-year stint with the station beginning in 1945, {{died in a}} hit-and-run vehicle-pedestrian accident on West Main Street in Uniontown. Though McMullen underwent surgery to repair two broken legs and his right arm, his condition swiftly declined. A Papa John's Pizza delivery driver later admitted to police that he was behind the wheel, and had taken {{his eyes off the}} road to read a <b>delivery</b> <b>slip</b> when he struck McMullen. McMullen {{went on to become a}} speech writer for Gov. David Lawrence, the Executive Director of the Fayette County Redevelopment Authority, the Director of Community Development for Uniontown, and served his community as All-American Commander VFW Post 47 and Exalted Ruler of the Elks BPOE #370 Uniontown.|$|E

Compton hooked it away for two and the next <b>delivery</b> <b>slipped</b> out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd.

50|$|Contractor's Special hybrid - Dodge {{announced}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Ram, dubbed the Contractor's Special, in 2003. However, the schedule for <b>delivery</b> <b>slipped</b> as Dodge {{backed away from the}} vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an AC electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with General Motors and BMW.|$|R

5|$|Soon after, Compton edged to the slips {{from the}} bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and {{travelled}} half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next <b>delivery</b> <b>slipped</b> out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.|$|R

50|$|On November 9, 2013, {{the first}} R188 train, {{consisting}} of cars 7811-7821, {{were placed in}} service on the 7 train {{as part of its}} 30-day revenue acceptance test. After successful completion, it entered revenue service by December 15, 2013. By July 2014, the <b>delivery</b> schedule had <b>slipped</b> by about 6-7 months. However, delivery of the cars sped up; all remaining R188 cars were expected to be delivered by the end of July 2016, but the last R188 cars were delivered in late June 2016.|$|R
50|$|A {{shipping}} list, packing list, waybill, {{packing slip}} (also {{known as a}} bill of parcel, unpacking note, packaging <b>slip,</b> (<b>delivery)</b> docket, delivery list, manifest or customer receipt), is a shipping document that accompanies delivery packages, usually inside an attached shipping pouch or inside the package itself. It commonly includes an itemized detail of the package contents and does not include customer pricing. It serves to inform all parties, including transport agencies, government authorities, and customers, about {{the contents of the}} package. It helps them deal with the package accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Airbus {{announced}} the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months. This reduced {{the total number}} of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90-100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the <b>delivery</b> schedule <b>slipping</b> an additional six to seven months. Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70-80 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS, and led to the departure of EADS CEO No√´l Forgeard, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion. On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 programme, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay, pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010. The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to ‚Ç¨4.8 billion.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{continued}} their dominance throughout the second day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey {{continued their}} partnership, putting together 209. Flintoff finally took Hussey's wicket {{when he was}} on 86, bowled through the gate, with the off-stump out of the ground, when he had looked set for a century. Matthew Hoggard finally made a significant breakthrough in the afternoon, taking the wickets of Ponting (for 196) and Adam Gilchrist (for a duck) in the same over, both men out lbw. Gilchrist, in particular, was out to a ball bowled from around the wicket from the right-arm bowler Hoggard, a continuation of England's tactics against him in the 2005 Ashes series, which had restricted him to a top score of 49*. Ponting's 196 allowed him to surpass Graham Gooch as the seventh highest Test runscorer of all time (Gooch scored 8900 runs). Michael Clarke crafted a solid 56 before falling to James Anderson, edging a good <b>delivery</b> to <b>slip.</b> Australia's tail wagged, with Brett Lee scoring 43 and Stuart Clark hitting a quick-fire 39 off 23 balls before having his leg stump knocked out of the ground by Flintoff. His innings included two huge sixes off the bowling of James Anderson, who ended the innings with figures of 141 runs for just one wicket. Australia were able to declare their innings with the score 9/602 after tea.|$|R
2500|$|The 2005 Ashes tour {{started with}} the Australians taking on a Professional Cricketers' Association XI at the picturesque ground at Arundel in a Twenty20 game. A crowd of 11,000 turned {{up to see the}} {{tourists}} win with one ball to spare, although in practice the result was always clear after an opening partnership of 131 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The Aussies got an ideal start as Stephen Fleming edged Brett Lee's first <b>delivery</b> to the <b>slips</b> and the Masters XI were 0 for 1, having been put in to bat by Australia. Darren Maddy made 70 in 57 balls and Paul Collingwood (38) and Mark Ealham (39) also scored runs, {{but the rest of the}} team made little impression as the PCA Masters XI made 167 for 6. The Aussies lost only two wickets in making their target.|$|R
50|$|In England's first innings, Johnson {{shared the}} new ball with Ryan Harris, but went wicketless {{in his first}} spell. He was {{introduced}} into the attack after the dismissal of Alastair Cook when Jonathan Trott arrived at the crease. Johnson's first delivery to Trott was a short ball that struck Trott on the gloves. In the first ball of his next over, the last over before lunch, Johnson dismissed Trott off another short ball as Trott edged {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper. In the second session, Johnson continued bowling short and had Michael Carberry caught in the slips for 40, bowling around the wicket. He struck in his next over as Joe Root edged a full <b>delivery</b> to third <b>slip.</b> Johnson took another wicket in his following over, as Graeme Swann inside-edged a length ball to short leg, and England had collapsed from 2/82 to 8/91. England were bowled out for 138 with Johnson finishing with the best figures among Australian bowlers (4 for 64).|$|R
