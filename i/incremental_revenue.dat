25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% <b>incremental</b> <b>revenue</b> gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E

40|$|Post-combustion Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) {{promises}} to substantially reduce CO 2 emissions from conventional coal-fired power plants. The key barrier to commercialization is its high operational cost {{due to a}} significant energy penalty. Dispatchable CCS {{has the potential to}} reduce the revenue loss by taking advantage of the volatility of energy prices. In addition, dispatchable CCS can serve as a cost effective way to integrate intermittent electricity generation from renewable sources. This project investigates the economic feasibility of retrofitting Powerton Power Plant in Illinois with dispatchable CCS (both in two-mode and three-mode arrangements) and integrating it with one local wind farm. A simulation model is used to estimate the incremental costs and <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> associated with a dispatchable CCS system and wind integration in comparison to conventional continuously-operated CCS system. According to the simulation results, flexible operation of CCS integrated with wind power effectively mitigates the profit loss due to the CCS energy penalty. A two-mode arrangement dispatchable CCS integrated with this wind farm generates approximately 2. 5 billion dollars in a period 30 years while the total profit from a three-mode arrangement system varies from 1 to 2. 4 billion dollars. Comparing <b>incremental</b> costs and <b>revenues,</b> it can be concluded that the two-mode arrangement is more suitable for Powerton power plant because it generates positive profit even without the wind farm. More research needs to be conducted before we extend this conclusion to other utilities, however, flexible operation of CCS and synergy with wind power promise to lower the carbon price needed to make CCS economic...|$|R

40|$|Companies in {{a variety}} of {{industries}} (e. g., airlines, hotels, theaters) often use last-minute sales to dispose of unsold capacity. Although this may generate <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> in a short term, the long-term consequences of such a strategy are not immediately obvious: more discounted last-minute tickets may lead to more consumers anticipating the discount and delaying the purchase rather than buying at the regular (higher) prices, and hence potentially reducing revenues for the company. To mitigate such behavior, many service providers have turned to opaque intermediaries such as hotwire. com that hide many descriptive attributes of the service (e. g., departure times for airline tickets) so that the buyer cannot fully predict the ultimate service provider. Using a stylized economic model, this paper attempts to explain and compare the benefits of last-minute sales directly to consumers vs. through an opaque intermediary. We utilize the notion of rational expectations to model consumer purchasing decisions: con-sumers make early purchase decisions based on expectations regarding future availability, and these expectations are correct in equilibrium. We show that direct last-minute sales are preferred over selling through an opaque intermediary when consumer valuations for travel are high and/o...|$|R

We use the model to evaluate profit- improving, theoretically-preferred changes to the extant compensation scheme. These recommendations were then implemented at the focal firm. Agent behavior and output under the new compensation plan is found to change as predicted. The new plan resulted in a 9 % improvement in overall revenues, which translates to about $ 0. 98 million <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> per month, indicating the success of the field-implementation. The results bear out the face validity of dynamic agency theory for real-world compensation design.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{extends the}} traditional, static cost and revenue model {{developed}} in manufacturing settings by studying four factors that moderate the cost-revenue relationship: real options, returns-to-scale, structural changes, {{and levels of}} aggregation. We use the motion picture industry as a research setting since it provides an interesting context {{for this type of}} research. For instance each product in the industry, a motion picture, is an experiential good with tractable costs and revenues. The critical costs to developing and marketing a successful motion picture are production and advertising costs. Using a sample of 1, 695 motion pictures released between 1990 and 2003, we find that advertising costs – a result of the managerial exercise of real options – have a stronger association with revenues than do production costs – a first-stage investment. We also find that movies with larger costs have higher <b>incremental</b> <b>revenues</b> per cost, consistent with returns-to-scale. In addition, we discover that structural changes in the industry greatly affect the cost-revenue relationship during our observation period. Finally, we find that the cost-revenue relationship is stronger at a higher level of aggregation than at a lower level. In conclusion, our results indicate that the simple linear static model of cost-revenue relationship is limited. I...|$|R

With Purisima leading Aquino's economic management team, the Philippine economy has kept a 6-year running growth average of 6.2%, its fastest run in 40 years. Under the Aquino administration, the Philippines has also been enjoying strengthening investor and consumer confidence, upgraded to a notch above investment grade by Standard & Poor's and to investment grade by Moody's, Fitch, the National Information and Credit Evaluation (NICE) Investors Service, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency. With 24 positive credit rating actions since 2010, the Philippines is so far the world's most upgraded sovereign. Increased confidence on the Philippines’ prospects has led to a sixfold jump in foreign direct investments (FDIs), from $1.07 billion in 2010 to $6.20 billion in 2014.Under Purisima's watch, the Philippines' debt as a percentage to GDP fell to a historic low of 44.8% as of 2015, a 10 percentage point decline from the 54.8% posted in 2009 before the Aquino administration took over with a governance philosophy espousing fiscal responsibility.
