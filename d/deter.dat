50|$|In 1999, <b>Deters</b> {{was sworn}} in as Ohio’s 44th State Treasurer. As Treasurer, he was {{responsible}} for collecting, managing and investing over $11 billion in assets for the State of Ohio. In the fall of 2004, <b>Deters</b> became a write-in candidate for his former position, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney. He was elected Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney on November 2, 2004 with nearly 60% of the vote. On April 1, 2005, <b>Deters</b> and Matthias Heck were sued in their official capacity in a federal lawsuit, Citizens for Tax Reform v. <b>Deters.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} <b>deter</b> police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not <b>deter</b> mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties {{that help to}} <b>deter</b> predator attacks.|$|E
5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called cochineal).

30|$|At 6  months post TKA, 73 (63.5  %) {{patients}} {{reported that}} they were able to kneel. Twenty-eight (24.3  %) patients {{reported that they}} were unable to kneel due to pain, and a further 10 (8.7  %) reported pain to a <b>deterring</b> factor. Discomfort and pressure in the knee were reported as <b>deterring</b> factors in 38.3  % of patients (n =  28). By 12  months post TKA, there was an increase in the percentage of patients who reported they could kneel to 72  % (n =  59). The number of patients reporting pain as the reason for not being able to kneel decreased to 14 (17.1  %), with 15 patients (18.3  %) reporting pain as a <b>deterring</b> factor. The percentage of patients reporting discomfort and pressure as <b>deterring</b> factors at 12  months post TKA increased to 75.6  % (n =  62).|$|R
30|$|Gamification {{is defined}} as “the use of game design {{elements}} in non-game contexts” aiming to increase engagement and motivation (<b>Detering</b> et al., 2011). The term Gamification is young, however {{there has been a}} lot of interest in both academia as well as commercial applications (<b>Detering</b> et al., 2011; Dominguez et al., 2013). Gamification has been used more and more to increase both user activity and retention in the fields of interaction design and digital marketing (<b>Detering</b> et al., 2011). It has been applied in many different fields, like finance, health, education, and entertainment media to mention few (<b>Detering</b> et al., 2011, p. 9). According to the literature review of Hamari et al., (2014), gamification is becoming a more popular subject for academic inquiry and industry and thus, empirical results on the effectiveness of gamification are in great demand.|$|R
5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively <b>deter</b> all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related species such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely <b>deter</b> most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to <b>deter</b> predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to <b>deter</b> predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E

5|$|Fluorocarbon gases are {{generally}} greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 20,000 {{times that of}} carbon dioxide.
