50|$|DTPA is {{also used}} as a chelate for {{aquarium}} plant fertilizer, specifically iron, an essential micronutrient typically needed in substantial quantities by all plants. Chelates are dissolved organic substances that bind to metals and prevent them from forming larger molecules through oxidation. FeDTPA is often sold under the name iron chelate 10% or 11% when used {{for the purpose of}} aquarium plant fertilization. Iron typically found in the aquarium water column has been converted into the ferric state (Fe3+) since it is in the presence of dissolved oxygen. However plants require iron in the ferrous state (Fe2+), therefore additional energy must be expended in order to extract the ferric iron from the water column and convert it to the ferrous form. When used to chelate <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizer</b> DTPA ensures that the iron is kept in the ferrous state (Fe2+) over time so it can be utilized by aquatic plants without expending valuable energy.|$|E

Typical management for iron chlorosis includes {{the use of}} <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizers</b> or chlorosis tolerant cultivars. Calcareous and non-calcareous soil can be interspersed within fields. If chlorosis-prone areas within fields can be predicted accurately, site-specific use of <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and chlorosis-tolerant cultivars might be more profitable than uniform management. In this study, the use of vegetation indices (VI) derived from aerial imagery, on-the-go measure-ment of soil pH and apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) were evaluated for their potential to delineate chlorosis management zones. The study was conducted at six sites in 2004 and 2005. There was a significant statistical relationship between grain yield and selected properties at two sites (sites 1 (2005) and 3), moderate relationships at sites 2 and 4, and weak relationships at site 5. For sites 1 (2005) and 3, and generally across all sites, yield was predicted best with the combination of NDVI and deep ECa. These two properties were used to delineate chlorosis management zones for all sites. Sites 1 and 3 showed a good relationship between delineated zones and the selected properties, and would be good candidates for site-specific chlorosis management.

40|$|FeEDDHA {{products}} {{are applied to}} correct iron chlorosis in plants and consist of a mixture of EDDHA isomers chelated to iron. In this study such mixtures have been divided into four (groups of) isomers: racemic o,o-EDDHA, meso o,o-EDDHA, o,p-EDDHA and rest-EDDHA. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of these isomers differ and hence does their ability to deliver Fe to plants. To come to a soil-specific iron fertilization recommendation, the behaviour of the EDDHA isomers in the soil needs to be understood. This behaviour has been examined in a soil interaction experiment as a function of time, and it has been related to soil properties. The isomer fractions remaining in solution can be ranked racemic o,o-FeEDDHA > meso o,o-FeEDDHA > rest-FeEDDHA > o,p-FeEDDHA, regardless of soil properties. The o,o-EDDHA isomers largely determine the Fe concentration in solution. Although rest-EDDHA also consists of compounds that chelate Fe more strongly than meso o,o-EDDHA, the latter is on average better capable of keeping Fe in solution upon interaction with soil. The principal adsorption surface differs per EDDHA isomer. For racemic o,o-FeEDDHA it is organic matter, for meso o,o-FeEDDHA it is iron (hydr) oxide and for o,p-FeEDDHA clay minerals. Cu and Al are important competing cations. Cu forms soluble complexes with o,p-EDDHA, and Al with meso o,o-EDDHA not chelated to Fe. Al is likely to affect the effectiveness of a potential shuttle effect. The tendency of o,p-FeEDDHA and rest-FeEDDHA to be removed from solution, makes these isomers less effective as <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in soil application, in particular on clay soils...|$|E

We investigated here the specific differences in water purification effect and plant productivity of rice and umbrella plants both of which were grown on the surface of　the　waters with various levels of eutrophication. The results were as follows: 1 ） ln both species, the rate of nitrogen absorption （NR） was positively related to the crop growth rate （CGR）. Both parameters greatly changed in value with water conditions, showing a negative relation with pH and positive relation with electrical conductivity （EC）. 2 ） Application of a slow-release fertilizer as basal-dressing to rice in the eary growth stage had a beneficial effect on subsequent growth vigor, and the highest grain yield of rice was 542 g m^ 2 comparable to the yield obtained in paddy-grown plants. The leaf photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content and plant weight were increased, depending on the water quality, by applying acid and iron controlling chemicals together with the basal-dressing fertilizer. High pH caused an iron deficiency in rice and greatly restricted its growth. ln the eutrophied waters, <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application to plants was very effective in improving the growth. 3 ） CGR and water purification effect of umbrella plants were significantly superior to those of rice examined under all of the growth conditions in this study.

In this work {{the advantage of the}} use of chelates enriched in the stable isotope 57 Fe has been studied. Prior to biological assay, an interaction experiment with 57 Fe chelates was performed to test whether isotopic exchange occurs between native Fe (mainly 56 Fe) from soil and the 57 Fe from the chelates using two stable chelate: o,oEDDHA/ 57 Fe 3 + and HJB/ 57 Fe 3 +, and two less stable ones: o,pEDDHA/ 57 Fe 3 + and DCHA/ 57 Fe 3 +. In this soil conditions a quite slow isotopic exchange could be observed, being the more stable chelates those that present the lower exchange. These results may be used to distinguish the source of the Fe in the biological experiment. Soybean seeds (Glycine max L. cv Klaxon) were grown in a calcareous soil in a growth chamber. Two different experiments are presented in this work. In the first experiment 2. 5 mg 57 Fe/kg of soil as o,oEDDHA/ 57 Fe 3 +; o,pEDDHA/ 57 Fe 3 +, HJB/ 57 Fe 3 + and DCHA/ 57 Fe 3 + were applied. In the second one, different dose of o,oEDDHA/ 57 Fe 3 + and HBED/ 57 Fe 3 + were assayed. With the results obtained in both experiment we can concluded that the use of the isotope 57 Fe allow studying the absorption pattern from the chelate and differences among the treatments assayed can be better observed. In conclusion, this technique can be used to evaluate the efficacy of new chelates as iron sources for plants grown in soils, since it allows confirming the origin of the Fe uptake by the treated plants...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} use of IONs as an <b>iron</b> <b>fertilizer</b> {{has been}} investigated before in other systems [17 – 19]. In this investigation, {{it was for the}} first time tested whether there is an enzymatic effect of a similar fertilizer, additional to the effect of providing the micro nutrient, iron, to an important crop species. The control was given an adequate amount of chelated iron. We also tested, a positive control, in which a molar equivalent amount of iron (III) ions was supplemented to the negative control with an adequate amount of plant available iron. Hence, the positive effects from IONs seen in our experiments arise from the properties of the IONs. We would like to suggest that it is the known enzymatic effects of IONs that are at play [23, 25, 26]. Other mechanisms can still not be excluded—IONs could also interact with proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules [27], or it can be that the nanoparticles absorb native iron ions onto the surface and hence reduce harmful Fenton reactions. The fact that the hydrogen peroxide levels of leaves were reduced in the ION-treatments is in itself an indirect proof of nanoparticle uptake. Together with increased concentration of iron and changed magnetization in maghemite the picture becomes more complete. The positive control with iron (III) ions had a reduced concentration of iron content in the leaves, indicating that the plants have capability to reduce iron ion uptake as a defense mechanism. This further suggests that the increased concentration of iron in the leaves in maghemite treatments are indeed nanoparticles, which are not as toxic to the plant as elevated levels of iron ions can be. The magnetic measurements show a superparamagnetic behavior and blocked nanoparticle magnetic moments at low temperature typical of very small γ-Fe 2 O 3 in the leaves treated with maghemite [28], clearly demonstrating nanoparticle uptake. The miniscule amount of Y administered should not produce any effect on the plants; there is little known about the effects of Y on plants, but Fu et al. (2014) established that 2  mg L− 1 Y was the median lethal dose (LD 50) in a hydroponic system, and Maksimovic et al. (2014) started seeing toxic effects at 10 − 5  mol L− 1 Y [29, 30]. In the highest concentration used in our experiments, an approximate amount of 50  mg (5.6   10 − 4  mol) of Y was added per pot by irrigation to the soil, from which only a fraction can be expected to be taken up. What is taken up should not be readily available as ions, but rather be bound in the maghemite particles. The purpose of introducing Y into the synthesis is to reduce the solubility of maghemite nanoparticles and also to prevent transformation into hematite, a less enzymatic form of iron oxide. Undoubtedly, it is beneficial to have increased catalase activity during stress conditions [31], since a whole range of stress conditions are known to cause toxic accumulations of H 2 O 2 [32]. Further, it has become increasingly evident that H 2 O 2 also serve as a signaling molecule for stress [32, 33]. Increased biomass production is yet to be corroborated, preferably looking into the oil seed yields and quality, as well. Other features, such as increased speed of leaf growth, a very good property in agricultural setting where competition against weeds is crucial, can readily be taken into consideration. It has been shown in Arabidopsis that nano zero valent iron particles can induce extrusion of protons into the apoplast of leaves and thereby allowing turgor-driven cell-wall expansion [34]. The same effect was also observed in roots, which could also be beneficial during drought stress [35]. They also observed an increase in stomatal openings of the leaves which could lead to water loss, but when they measured, there was only a marginal difference compared to the control. It is a known paradox that the relationship between stomatal opening and water transpiration is not linear [36]. This relationship is also highly affected by the environment by, for example, relative humidity or wind [37]. Although, zero valent nanoparticles are of course not to be considered the same as maghemite, the mechanism for leaf elongation seen in our experiments must be investigated. Ghafariyan et al. (2013) observed, as we did, an increase in chlorophyll concentration in the leaves upon addition of IONs compared to a negative control with no iron at all. When they compared to chelated iron there was no difference. However, adding equal amounts of chelated iron as IONs will result in more plant available iron, since in the case of particles great parts of the iron is stored in the crystal structures. Hence, {{there is a possibility that}} the plants only fertilized with IONs where actually suffering iron deficiency. We found higher amounts of chlorophyll in the leaves (according to SPAD-measurements, see Fig.  1) when IONs were added auxiliary to the chelated iron. We also measured a reduced amount of hydrogen peroxide and MDA in the leaves, after drought, when we added IONs. Rui et al. (2016) did not measure hydrogen peroxide but MDA and enzymes related to oxidative stress. They suggested that oxidative stress does not occur from addition of IONs, and indeed, they did as well find a reduced amount of MDA in the leaves, compared to chelated iron, on 10  mg kg− 1 concentration. In the roots, they saw a reduction of MDA as they increased concentration of IONs. They also measured a reduced amount of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity compared to chelated iron suggesting that our hypothesis that IONs can work as reactive oxygen scavengers, in vivo, might be right. Reactive oxygen scavenging was further demonstrated by our measured reduction of hydrogen peroxide in the leaves of Brassica napus. This explains the increased resistance to drought that is observed upon addition of IONs.|$|E

40|$|Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is {{the second}} most {{important}} oilseed in India, which is mainly grown in states like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. More than one-third of the soils in India are calcareous and spread mostly in the low rainfall areas of the western and central parts of the country where groundnut is a major crop. As calcareous soils are deficient in available iron (Fe 2 +), iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) is more prevalent in Saurashtra region of Gujarat, Marathwada region of Maharashtra, and parts of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka causing significant reduction in yield (Singh et al., 2004). Iron deficiency leads to interveinal chlorosis of younger leaves, while under severe deficiency they turn into white and papery and further as brown and necrotic. Genetic variability for resistance to IDC has been reported earlier in groundnut (Samdur et al., 2000; Li and Yan-Xi, 2007).
