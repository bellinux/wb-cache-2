5|$|The {{song was}} covered {{several times in}} 1965, {{including}} a version by The Turtles on their album It Ain't Me Babe and a version by The Walker Brothers on their album Take It <b>Easy</b> <b>with</b> The Walker Brothers. Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any Day Now. A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman. Eric Clapton covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Other musicians who have covered the song include Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, Bridget St. John, Eliza Gilkyson, and Les Fradkin.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because {{that was all that}} would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way that}} aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become <b>easy.</b> <b>With</b> regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E

David Hussey and Gurkeerat Singh helped KXIP to stabilize {{in the middle}} overs until Ashwin and Bravo struck back. Michael Hussey and Murali Vijay started the chase in a slow and steady manner. Once they were settled Hussey's blows made the run chase too <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> CSK winning it with 10 wickets and 16 balls to spare. Vijay playing the second fiddle reached his half century in run a ball. Mike Hussey was awarded Man of the Match for his clean-hit 86 off 54 balls.|$|E

500|$|Rich Etruscans left {{elaborate}} tombs, mostly {{gathered in}} large necropoli some way outside their cities. [...] These were generously filled with grave goods, [...] especially ceramics, which give us {{most of our}} understanding of Etruscan culture. [...] Typically, in the tufa regions of southern Etruria, the burial chamber was cut from solid rock below ground, which is relatively <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> this rock, {{but there was a}} structure above, often rather large. In other regions they are normally built up above ground. [...] They were reused for further burials in the same family over several generations, and would often have become very crowded with sarchophagi and grave-goods, though the known survivals have now been emptied, either by looters or archaeologists.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{took issue}} with the game's lack of originality. Henry Kelly of The Digital Fix {{comments}} that [...] "The character models are quite basic and unimaginative - Jeremy has typically harsh features and the female characters are given skimpy outfits {{to show off their}} stereotyped fantasy physiques". X-ONE Magazine calls the game an [...] "unashamed clone of Diablo", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from Diablo. The gameplay was considered by critics to be too <b>easy,</b> <b>with</b> a terrible enemy AI that made combat unchallenging, interspersed with what Henry Kelly called [...] "painfully simple non-puzzles". Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements, the lack of online co-op, and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted.|$|E

[...] Butt was also [...] "dubious of the number of credits," [...] stating that the game may seem <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> unlimited continues, but that the player will [...] "still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island." [...] Buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples, explaining that it's [...] "a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice."

500|$|Tucker {{considered}} a trip abroad would enhance his insight and resume generally, and specifically prepare {{him for a}} possible, though not likely, diplomatic appointment. He expected there was much to be learned for his country's benefit in the British factories, great estates and crowded cities. With his finances in order and a three-month leave from the university, in 1839 he made a trip to Great Britain and after some time in Shakespeare country, Stratford-Upon-Avon, he settled in Liverpool. He {{did not succeed in}} making all the expected social connections, {{with the exception of the}} 1st Earl of Leicester and his wife, with whom he frequently discussed politics and agriculture. Though admiring the succinct debates in Parliament, he found Queen Victoria's procession [...] "more fit to amuse a child than one of my age". On the whole he found conversation did not come <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> the British, and concluded [...] "there were more churls in England than in all of Europe besides." [...] This journey, along with his interest in the doctrines of Thomas Robert Malthus on populace, inspired Tucker to expound upon the mixed blessings of a prospective urbanized world. Some of his hypotheses were included in The Progress of the United States in Population and Wealth (Boston, 1843). This work gained him one of his proudest honors, a membership in the Statistical Society of Paris.|$|E
500|$|McGrady {{was known}} for his laid-back {{demeanor}} and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname [...] "The Big Sleep". Many of his contemporaries, including Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce, have called him {{one of the most difficult}} players that they ever had to guard. His playing style has been compared to that of George Gervin; both players made scoring appear <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> their [...] "smooth" [...] approach to the game. At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense; in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe elaborated, [...] "He glided through the lane, crouched into traffic, and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim." [...] McGrady would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders, making him a threat to score from anywhere on the court. These qualities, in addition to his ability to survey the floor and make accurate pocket passes when necessary, have led analysts to describe him as being ahead of his time; in 2017, ESPN's Amin Elhassan remarked that McGrady was built for the style of positionless basketball that was being played in the modern era. On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady's effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level in meaningful games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo Power {{praised the}} story {{and the number of}} lightsaber combos but criticized the game's {{easiness}} and hack-and-slash gameplay. It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber controls and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is <b>easy,</b> <b>with</b> Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom. GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms. The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Voice Acting.|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it <b>easy</b> <b>with</b> your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
