In Corruptions story, Samus <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become {{the leader of a}} Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets. Corruptions gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote, and the interchangeable beams are replaced with a stackable upgrade system.|$|E

Aragorn manages to fight off the attackers, but Frodo's blood <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> evil. As they race to Rivendell, they are met by Glorfindel (Steve Staley), who gives Frodo his horse.

500|$|In {{the first}} level of Dark Forces, which is set prior to A New Hope, Katarn recovers the plans to the Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of {{destroying}} entire planets. The Rebel Alliance uses the plans to find a weakness in and then destroy the Death Star. Katarn then aids the Rebels in stopping {{the threat of the}} Imperial [...] "Dark Trooper" [...] project. Despite the successful missions on behalf of the Alliance, however, Katarn does not join their cause. Dark Forces II begins several years after the destruction of the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi, when Katarn is informed of the exact details of his father's death. His father, Morgan Katarn, had discovered the location of [...] "The Valley of the Jedi", a source of great Force power, but a Dark Jedi named Jerec murdered Morgan in an attempt to find the location. Katarn travels to the Valley of the Jedi while learning the ways of the Jedi himself. Eventually, he confronts and defeats Jerec, avenging his father's death. However, Katarn still does not join the Jedi Order, instead using his powers for the New Republic, and taking on an apprentice with a similar history to himself; Mara Jade. During this time, Katarn learns of a Sith temple on the planet Dromund Kaas. There, Katarn <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> the Dark Side of the Force. However, Jade is able to convince him to return to the Light and they leave together.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Great Music of the Ainur {{stood as}} {{template}} {{for all of}} history and all of material creation in the Middle-earth cycle (it was first sung before Time, and then the universe was made in its image), there was an aspect of everything in Middle-earth that came of Melkor’s malign influence; everything had been [...] "corrupted". Tolkien elaborates on this in Morgoth's Ring, drawing an analogy between the One Ring, into which Sauron committed much of his power, and all of Arda—"Morgoth's Ring"—which contains and <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> the residue of Melkor's power until the Remaking of the World.|$|E
2500|$|When Light {{discovers the}} Death Note, which was {{dropped into the}} Human World by the Shinigami Ryuk, who becomes Light's companion, he begins a crusade against evil, {{planning}} to kill criminals and other ne'er-do-wells until only those he approves of are left. While his task originates with good intentions, he <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> power within a week, plotting to rule his utopia as [...] "the god of the new world". His ethics are utilitarian, justifying the most extreme acts in service of his cause. He is also driven by a need for victory, which motivates most of his cruelest acts. Combined {{with the power of}} the Death Note, his hubris and genius-level intellect convince him that only he can save the world.|$|E
2500|$|At Ōkura, Ogawa {{initiated}} one of {{the most}} popular themes in pink film, the [...] "urban paranoia" [...] story. His trilogy of films beginning with Conception and Venereal Disease (1968) was an example of this genre, in which an innocent country girl <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> life in the big city. Ogawa also directed [...] "pink kaidan" [...] or erotic ghost stories for Ōkura, and it is with these titles for which he is best remembered. Ōkura was involved in the international distribution system involving softcore pornographic films beginning in the mid-1960s. A 1969 report from Kinema Jumpo indicated that some of Ogawa's films for Ōkura, including 1966-06 [...] (June 1966) and [...] (September 1967) had been exported and shown in England. Ogawa claims that his favorite of his films is [...] (November 1968), but most critics name [...] (June 1968) as his best film. Both films were made for Ōkura. Ogawa stayed with Ōkura for six years, joining Million Film in 1970 and later working at Shintōhō Eiga and Nikkatsu.|$|E

2500|$|Cricket in Zimbabwe {{suffered}} {{a crisis that}} lasted from 2003 to 2011 where player withdrawals such as the [...] "Black-armband protest" [...] by Andy Flower and Henry Olonga along with a mass loss of players in 2004 due to a general strike resulted in very poor performances by the national team. Presently Zimbabwe is {{in the period of}} rebuilding itself as the domestic structure was re-structured in 2009. Many people allege that the administration of cricket in Zimbabwe <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> the influence of Robert Mugabe's government, who are widely accused of following racist, in particular anti-white, policies. Positive signs began to emerge for Zimbabwe after the 2007 Cricket World Cup especially when in the 2007 World Twenty20 Zimbabwe defeated what was arguably the strongest side in the world at the time, Australia. Along with this Zimbabwe gradually began to show encouraging signs of improvement and four years later they returned to the highest format of the game, Test Cricket. In their first match since their return in August 2011 they comprehensively defeated Bangladesh.|$|E
60|$|The army under Sosa was {{constrained}} {{to winter}} in this island, {{not only because}} the season was far spent, but also because the sick passengers could no longer support the incommodities of the sea. The place notwithstanding was not very proper for infirm persons, for the air is unwholesome; which proceeds from hence, that the sea overflowing the low-lands of the isle, at the spring tides, the mass of waters there gathered and inclosed <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> the heats; for which reason, the inhabitants are commonly short-lived, but more especially strangers; upon which occasion, Mozambique is generally called the sepulchre of the Portuguese. Besides the intemperance of the air, at the same time, an infectious disease was raging in the country.|$|E
60|$|Another mistake as to my {{literary}} ancestry is made whenever I {{violate the}} romantic convention that all women are angels {{when they are}} not devils; that they are better looking than men; that their part in courtship is entirely passive; and that the human female form is the most beautiful object in nature. Schopenhauer wrote a splenetic essay which, as it is neither polite nor profound, was probably intended to knock this nonsense violently on the head. A sentence denouncing the idolized form as ugly has been largely quoted. The English critics have read that sentence; and I must here affirm, with as much gentleness as the implication will bear, that it has yet to be proved that they have dipped any deeper. At all events, whenever an English playwright represents a young and marriageable woman as being anything but a romantic heroine, he is disposed of without further thought as an echo of Schopenhauer. My own case is a specially hard one, because, when I implore the critics who are obsessed with the Schopenhaurian formula to remember that playwrights, like sculptors, study their figures from life, and not from philosophic essays, they reply passionately that I am not a playwright and that my stage figures do not live. But even so, I may and do ask them why, if they must give the credit of my plays to a philosopher, they do not give it to an English philosopher? Long before I ever read a word by Schopenhauer, or even knew whether he was a philosopher or a chemist, the Socialist revival of the eighteen-eighties brought me into contact, both literary and personal, with Mr Ernest Belfort Bax, an English Socialist and philosophic essayist, whose handling of modern feminism would provoke romantic protests from Schopenhauer himself, or even Strindberg. As a matter of fact I hardly noticed Schopenhauer's disparagements of women when they came under my notice later on, so thoroughly had Mr Bax familiarized me with the homoist attitude, and forced me to recognize the extent to which public opinion, and consequently legislation and jurisprudence, <b>is</b> <b>corrupted</b> <b>by</b> feminist sentiment.|$|E
