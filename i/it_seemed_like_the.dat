5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential side effects) and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile.|$|E

25|$|The Pacific Coast League, from 1952–1957, was {{the only}} minor league to obtain open classification. At this time, the major leagues only {{extended}} as far west as St. Louis and {{as far south as}} Washington, D.C. This classification severely restricted the rights of the major leagues to draft players out of the PCL, and at the time <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> PCL would eventually become a third major league. The PCL would revert to Triple-A classification in 1958 due to increasing television coverage of major league games and in light of the Dodgers and Giants moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The open classification no longer exists in the major league rules.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hot start}} to the season, the Stars {{dominated}} {{the first half of}} the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old Stars were back, as through {{the first half of the}} season, they went 30–15–6. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded James Neal and Matt Niskanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Alex Goligoski. After an awful second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5–3, costing them a playoff spot.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued the {{attitude}} of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement {{on the basis of their}} indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.|$|E

25|$|It's {{revealed}} that four days earlier, Jack West {{escaped from the}} Pit in the Ethiopian mine, rescued Pooh Bear from sacrifice and freed the Jewish slave-miners. In gratitude, the miners give him the sacred stones that Wolf had been using them to dig for - the Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, which contain the final incantation to activate the Machine when all the pillars are placed. Jack and Pooh travel to their old farm in Kenya, finding Horus (Jack's falcon) and the Adamson twins waiting; they'd come to the farm because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> best isolated safe place. They share with Jack {{the news that the}} Brotherhood has a mole in Wolf's unit, a marine code-named Switchblade, who plans to sabotage Wolf's effort to place the Second Pillar. Jack and the Adamsons head to Zanzibar, where an old friend of Jack's is hiding out, making a career after deserting the US army to attack gun-runners in Africa. Pooh leaves them at the airport to go north and rescue Stretch from the Mossad's torture chambers. Before he leaves, Jack gives him a GPS locator with which to signal Jack if he needs help.|$|E
25|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now {{called the}} series his most {{anticipated}} anime of the season, being curious {{about how it}} would handle the adaptation of a branching story into a single one. Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 {{as part of a}} preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still interested in how the story would turn out, and appreciated the use of Chaos;Head-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still worth watching for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.|$|E
25|$|Notre Dame's next game, {{and final}} home {{game of the}} season, came against the 1-8 Syracuse Orange. Syracuse, led by first-year coach Greg Robinson and quarterback Perry Patterson, had spoiled the Irish chance of not having a losing season in 2003 when they routed the Irish in the Carrier Dome by 26. This year, however, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Orange, ranked last in total yards, were over-matched. The Orange, however, kept up with the Irish in the first quarter, and after a failed field goal attempt by D.J. Fitzpatrick, and a 51-yard run by Damien Rhodes on the ensuing drive, the Orange scored the first points of {{the game with a}} 31-yard field goal by John Barker. On the next Irish drive, Fitzpatrick's field goal attempt was blocked, and the Orange kept the lead. However, four minutes later, a 25-yard Brady Quinn pass to Maurice Stovall ended with a touchdown, giving the Irish the lead. A 30-yard pass to Jeff Samardzija, on the second play of the next Irish drive, gave the Irish a 14-3 lead that they would have at halftime. On the first play of the third quarter, Patterson was intercepted by Leo Ferrine, who {{returned}} it 17-yards for a touchdown to give the Irish a 21-3 lead. After a failed fourth down attempt at the Orange goal line, and a pair of punts by the Orange, Fitzpatrick gave the Irish a 24-3 lead with his 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Fitzpatrick kicked a 29-yard field goal, Darius Walker ran for a 3-yard touchdown, and Patterson threw an 18-yard touchdown to Joseph Kowaleski for the only Orange touchdown of the day, to give the final score of 34-10 in favor of the Irish. With the game, Quinn continued his Notre Dame record touchdown streak and the Irish moved to 6th nationally. They were also one win away from being eligible for a BCS bowl.|$|E

40|$|Research Question: Does the {{pharmacy}} market seem {{to change in}} accordance with the goals stipulated by the government due to the reregulation? This leads to the following sub-questions: Does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> availability of medical drugs for consumers increase? Does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> service for consumers get enhanced? Does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> supply of services for consumers increase? Does <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> costs of medical drugs are maintained? Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate if the trends resulting from the reregulation of {{the pharmacy}} monopoly correspond to the goals stipulated by the government. The purpose is furthermore to compare the reregulation of other Swedish markets and the reregulation of the pharmacy market in other Nordic countries in order to heed their lessons. Method: This study uses method triangulation, with a questionnaire directed to pharmacy customers forming the quantitative basis and interviews with specialists regarding the pharmacy market, forming the qualitative. The study also draws heavily on historic data regarding reregulation of Swedish markets and reregulation of the pharmacy market in other Nordic countries. Conclusions: Availability of medical drugs has increased and will presumably continue to do so.   Service quality has increased somewhat and will presumably continue to do so. Supply of services has increased and it will presumably continue to do so. The cost of medical drugs will only increase if it is required in order to satisfy the other goals. ...|$|R
500|$|To {{create the}} scene where Jones brings a semi truck from the {{parallel}} universe, the special effects crew took a smaller truck and dressed it enough so that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> longer semi {{with the help of}} CGI; the result was that in the episode, the viewer is led to believe that the truck had been [...] "cut" [...] in half after unsuccessfully entering the prime universe doorway. It was rigged so that it appeared to be on a tilt, and cables linked it to smash into a passing car. As the production crew considered William Bell to be a [...] "Renaissance man", they filled Bell's office with [...] "things that inspire him," [...] such as a prototype of Nina's mechanical arm and other items that [...] "evoke images and stimulate thought".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} episode was [...] "completely {{satisfying}} - funny when {{it needed to}} be, sweet when it wanted to be". Sepinwall said Jones was particularly funny during the fake date, {{as well as the}} [...] "constant one-upsmanship" [...] between Ron and Tom. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had a [...] "winning formula". He particularly praised Jones during the practice date, as well as Jerry's role during the contest, which Fowler said was a good way to allow the supporting cast to work together. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> episode [...] "took everything they were warming up to over the last few weeks, and hit them hard". Heisler particularly praised Poehler's performance, as well as the interactions between Ron and Tom. In contrast, however, A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "Practice Date" [...] "was the first time all year I felt like P wasn't firing on all cylinders".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before he was seeing similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but are too often made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels as they turned into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> game's artificial intelligence was made too easy to be fooled.|$|E

500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 4 October 2008 that Sam would depart from Holby City in [...] "a blaze of glory {{in a big}} Christmas storyline". A show insider revealed that [...] "Tom’s departure will leave his fans in tears, but Holby bosses are keeping tight-lipped {{about whether or not}} Sam will be killed off." [...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it. Sam Strachan has gone through so much in the past year with his cancer – <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> perfect time to make the break." [...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist. After being shown her future should she accept, Maria declined Sam's offer, and he and Keiron departed together.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "To the Blade", {{focuses on}} the death of Manchester-born aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of ISIL's [...] "Jihadi John". Higgs {{explained}} to Drowned in Sound that: [...] "He was a taxi driver from Stockport, I could have met him. And the fact that someone who did it was also from Britain, but this was being played out on a global scale... <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> craziest thing I’d ever heard." [...] Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of Arc. Several critics suggest that [...] "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" [...] is a commentary on the [...] "snake-oil appeal" [...] of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told The Line of Best Fit that the song also comments on [...] "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". [...] "No Reptiles" [...] supposes that political leaders are [...] "just fat, bald, old men, like soft-boiled eggs, that are just weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.|$|E

500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E
