60|$|At {{the club}} {{he got into}} more mischief. He met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway. The brickfield was called Klondyke. James had now a new {{direction}} to run in: down hill towards Bagthorpe, to Klondyke. Big penny-daisies grew in tufts {{on the brink of}} the yellow clay at Klondyke, yellow eggs-and-bacon spread their midsummer mats of flower. James came home with clay smeared all over him, discoursing brilliantly on grit and paste and presses and kilns and stamps. He carried home a rough and pinkish brick, and gloated over it. It was a <b>hard</b> <b>brick,</b> it was a non-porous brick. It was an ugly brick, painfully heavy and parched-looking.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless French chemists have amply proved by actual {{experiment}} that plants can grow and produce excellent results without any {{aid from the}} soil at all. You have only to suspend the seeds freely in the air by a string, and supply the rootlets of the sprouting seedlings with a little water, containing in solution small quantities of manure-stuffs, and the plants will grow {{as well as on}} their native heath, or even better. Indeed, nature has tried the same experiment on a larger scale in many cases, as with the cliff-side plants that root themselves in the naked clefts of granite rocks; the tropical orchids that fasten lightly on the bark of huge forest trees; and the mosses that spread even over the bare face of <b>hard</b> <b>brick</b> walls, with scarcely a chink or cranny in which to fasten their minute rootlets. The insect-eating plants are also interesting examples in their way of the curious means which nature takes for keeping up the manure supply under trying circumstances. These uncanny things are all denizens of loose, peaty soil, where they can root themselves sufficiently for purposes of foothold and drink, but where the water rapidly washes away all animal matter. Under such conditions the cunning sundews and the ruthless pitcher-plants set deceptive honey traps for unsuspecting insects, which they catch and kill, absorbing and using up the protoplasmic contents of their bodies, by way of manure, to supply their quota of nitrogenous material.|$|E

The dry period makes the soil <b>hard</b> as <b>brick,</b> one reason why people can plough and dig only after the rains. One can hardly find any stone except on the river banks, whose soil is light and easy to excavate.

40|$|Soil crumbs are {{important}} to soil functions. These include plant growth, {{and the growth of}} fungi and bacteria forming agents for binding and bonding of new crumbs. We have studied how commercial organic and conventional farming affect this interaction. A diverse crop rotation, including grass, and animal manure resulted in stable crumbs with a high content of biological binding and bonding agents. A cash crop rotation with the addition of only synthetic fertilizers resulted in small, stable aggregates – more like clods - with clay as binding agent. Such a soil will provide poor conditions for preparing seedbeds, because prolonged rain makes it soft and muddy while drought makes it <b>hard</b> as <b>brick...</b>|$|R

50|$|Block paving {{also known}} as brick paving is a {{commonly}} used decorative method of creating a pavement or hardstanding. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work {{to be carried out}} under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the paving bricks have been replaced. Typical areas of use would be for driveways, pavement, patios, town centres, precincts and more commonly in road surfacing. Bricks are typically made of concrete or clay, though other composite materials are also used. Each has its own means of construction. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a kiln to bake the <b>brick</b> <b>hard.</b> A concrete <b>brick</b> has to be allowed to set. The concrete paving bricks are a porous form of brick formed by mixing small stone hardcore, dyes, cement and sand and other materials in various amounts. Many block paving manufacturing methods are now allowing the use of recycled materials {{in the construction of the}} paving bricks such as crushed glass and crushed old building rubble.|$|R

50|$|For {{extruded}} bricks {{the clay}} {{is mixed with}} 10-15% water (stiff extrusion) or 20-25% water (soft extrusion) in a pugmill. This mixture is forced through a die to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces <b>hard,</b> dense <b>bricks,</b> and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150 °C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{development}} of the horizontal stationary engine in the mid 19th century, the requirements were no longer to support a single heavy beam but now to provide accurate alignment between the cylinders and crankshaft of a medium-speed engine. These foundations were substantial, going down perhaps three-dozen courses of brickwork below the engine bed. Deep iron anchors were provided within the brickwork for the engine to be bolted down. Rough local stone was no longer rigid enough and so foundations were constructed of many layers of <b>hard</b> engineering <b>brick,</b> as this was cheaper and more easily available than a cut ashlar stone of equal rigidity. As these engine ran at faster speeds than the beam engines, their vibration could also be higher requiring a foundation that could withstand such. Alignment between slideways and crankshaft depended upon the original care with which the foundation had been built.|$|R
2500|$|In 1856, Alexander Cunningham, later {{director-general}} of {{the archaeological}} survey of northern India, visited Harappa where the British engineers John and William Brunton were laying the East Indian Railway Company line connecting {{the cities of}} Karachi and Lahore.
