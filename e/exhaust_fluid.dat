25|$|Urea {{is used in}} SNCR and SCR {{reactions}} to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust gases from combustion from Diesel, dual fuel, and lean-burn natural gas engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the hydrolysis of the urea reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>fluid</b> (DEF, also known as AdBlue), a mixture of urea and water.|$|E

Cold bending of metal tubes is very important production method considering that metal tubes are widely used in {{a great variety of}} engineering products, such as automobile, aircraft, air conditioner, air compressor, <b>exhaust</b> systems, <b>fluid</b> lines. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs. This paper deals with the study of Rotary Draw Tube Bending process and the Finite Element Analysis and Simulation of Rotary Draw Tube Bending of a seamless metal tube for the analysis of spring back effect. Mathematical and Experimental analysis of spring back are carried out and results are compared. By applying the theory on pure beam bending deformation, the mathematical model of spring back for pipe bending deformation is established.

50|$|In a {{standard}} fluid-based system, a working fluid, typically water, glycol or mineral oil is then piped through these pipes or plate chillers. The {{heat from the}} PV cells is conducted through the metal and absorbed by the working fluid (presuming that the working fluid is cooler than the operating temperature of the cells). In closed-loop systems this heat is either exhausted (to cool it), or transferred at a heat exchanger, where it flows to its application. In open-loop systems, this heat is used, or <b>exhausted</b> before the <b>fluid</b> returns to the PV cells. It is also possible to disperse nanoparticles in the liquid to create a liquid filter for PV/T applications.

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} thermal balance {{and performance of}} a turbocharged gas spark ignition engine. The First Law of Thermodynamics was used for control volume around the engine to compute the output power, transferred energy to the cooling <b>fluid,</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases and also unaccounted losses through convection and radiation heat transfer. Thermal balance tests were performed for various operational conditions including full and half loads and different cooling fluid temperatures. Results indicate that by increasing engine load and coolant temperature, the percentage of transferred energy to the exhaust gases increased while the percentage of coolant energy decreased. Also, experimental data reveals that using gaseous fuel and a turbocharger (TC) in the engine leads to 4. 5 % and 4 % more thermal efficiency than gasoline and natural aspirated (NA), respectively. Also, second law analysis reveals that using a turbocharger leads to a 3. 6 % increase in exergetic efficiency of the engine, averagely.

50|$|Complex {{plumbing}} {{was needed}} to feed fuel and oxidizer into the clustered arrangement of rocket engines. This proved to be extremely fragile, and was {{a major factor in}} the design's launch failures. Furthermore, the N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all the stages had to be broken down and re-assembled. The engines for Block A were only test-fired individually and the entire cluster of 30 engines was never static test fired as a unit. Sergei Khrushchev stated that only two out of every batch of six engines were tested, and not the units actually intended for use in the booster. The reason for this was because the NK-15 engines had a number of valves that were activated by pyrotechnics rather than hydraulic or mechanical means, this being a weight-saving measure. Once shut, the valves could not be re-opened. As a result, the complex and destructive vibrational modes (which ripped apart propellant lines and turbines) as well as <b>exhaust</b> plume and <b>fluid</b> dynamic problems (causing vehicle roll, vacuum cavitation, and other problems) in Block A were not discovered and worked out before flight. Blocks B and V were static test fired as complete units.|$|R

The aerodynamic loss of LP exhaust hoods is almost the same as those of the stator and rotor blading in LP steam turbines. Designing high performance LP exhaust hoods should lead further enhancement of steam turbine efficiency. This paper presents the results of <b>exhaust</b> hood computational <b>fluid</b> dynamics (CFD) analyses using last stage exit velocity distributions measured in a full-scale development steam turbine as the inlet boundary condition to improve the accuracy of the CFD analysis. One of the main difficulties in predicting the aerodynamic performance of the exhaust hoods is the unsteady boundary layer separation of exhaust hood diffusers. A highly accurate unsteady numerical analysis is introduced in order to simulate the diffuser flows in LP exhaust hoods. Compressible Navier-Stokes equations and mathematical models for nonequilibrium condensation are solved using the high-order high-resolution finite-difference method based on the fourth-order compact MUSCL TVD scheme, Roe’s approximate Riemann solver, and the LU-SGS scheme. The SST turbulence model is also solved for evaluating the eddy viscosity. The computational results were validated using the measurement data, and the present CFD method was proven to be suitable as a useful tool for determining optimum three-dimensional designs of LP turbine exhaust diffusers...|$|R
