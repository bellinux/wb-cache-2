6000|$|I {{had never}} seen him in a more {{relaxing}} mood, a more approving one. My mother sat down beside me.... Words seem useless to express the complicated nature of my suffering at that moment,--my remorse, my sense of deception, of hypocrisy,--yes, and my terror. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> naturally, to answer my father's questions about affairs at the store, while all the time my eyes rested upon the objects of the room, familiar since childhood. Here were warmth, love, and safety. Why could I not be content with them, thankful for them? What was it in me that drove me from these sheltering walls out into the dark places? I glanced at my father. Had he ever known these wild, destroying desires? Oh, if I only could have confided in him! The very idea of it was preposterous. Such placidity as theirs would never understand the nature of my temptations, and I pictured to myself their horror and despair at my revelation. In imagination I beheld their figures receding while I drifted out to sea, alone. Would the tide--which was somehow within me--carry me out and out, in spite of all I could do? ...|$|E

6000|$|He went to {{the station}} to meet Rose Lawrence the day she came. When I went home from school Mrs. Lindsay {{told me she was}} in the parlour and took me in to be introduced. I was bitterly disappointed. Somehow, I had {{expected}} to meet, not indeed a young girl palpitating with youthful bloom, but a woman of ripe maturity, dowered with the beauty of harmonious middle-age--the feminine counterpart of Uncle Dick. Instead, I found in Rose Lawrence a small, faded woman of forty-five, gowned in shabby black. She had evidently been very pretty once, but bloom and grace were gone. Her face had a sweet and gentle expression, but was tired and worn, and her fair hair was plentifully streaked with grey. Alas, I thought compassionately, for Uncle Dick's dreams! What a shock the change to her must have given him! Could this be the woman on whom he had lavished such a life-wealth of love and reverence? <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her, but I found her shy and timid. She seemed to me uninteresting and commonplace. And this was Uncle Dick's Rose of joy! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went about}} {{the streets and}} peeped into people's front windows, and the decorations upon the tables were after {{the manner of the}} year 1850. Main Street was full of country folk from the outside come in to trade with the Zion Mercantile Co-operative Institute. The Church, I fancy, looks after the {{finances}} of this thing, and it consequently pays good dividends. The faces of the women were not lovely. Indeed, but for the certainty that ugly persons are just as irrational in the matter of undivided love as the beautiful, it seemed that polygamy was a blessed institution for the women, and that only the spiritual power could drive the hulking, board-faced men into it. The women wore hideous garments, and the men seemed to be tied up with string. They would market all that afternoon, and on Sunday go to the praying-place. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a few of them, but they spoke strange tongues and stared and behaved like cows. Yet one woman, and not an altogether ugly one, confided to me that she hated the idea of Salt Lake City being turned into a show-place for the amusement of the Gentile.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was asked}} to go, quite suddenly, and found myself there before I {{had time to think}} of what it might be. I {{understood}} her to say it was a meeting of some [...] "Sunday society," [...] some society that tried to turn the Sabbath from a day of woe to a day of rejoicing. [...] "St. George's Hall, Langham Place," [...] a cab, and there we were. I thought they would be picturesque Pagans. But the entertainment was the oddest it has ever been my lot to see, a kind of mystery. The place was dark, except for a big circle of light on a screen, and a dismal man with a long stick was talking about the effects of alcohol on your muscles. He talked and talked, and people went to sleep all about us. Euphemia's face looked so very pretty in the dim light that <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her and hold her hand, but she only said [...] "Ssh!" [...] And then they began showing pictures on the screen--the most shocking things!--stomachs, {{and all that kind of}} thing. They went on like that for an hour, and then there was a lot of thumping with umbrellas, and they turned the lights up and we went home. Curious way of spending Sunday afternoon, is it not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much better, indeed; if {{we could}} only raise her spirits, I think she would recover very well; but she is so sadly depressed. <b>I</b> must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Ethel--she may better {{understand}} her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Violence-Connected to {{the theme}} of Nazi Germany is the overall theme of {{violence}} throughout the novel. The Brotherhood of the Light uses violence, specifically smashing people's chests with hammers, and later murdering people. In the same interview Sorokin is asked why he brings up violence so much in this novel. Sorokin replies that violence fascinates him, [...] "Why can’t people do without violence? Why can’t they keep from killing? This is a mystery <b>to</b> me, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it in literary form.” Sorokin also mentions how violence is often justified by some overall goal, and how he plays with this idea in Bro, [...] "There is an idea, a lofty goal, in Bro the killing takes place {{in the name of a}} lofty goal." ...|$|R

"Turnbull," [...] said MacIan, [...] "you {{have said}} some things so true and some so false that I want to talk; and <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{so that you}} {{understand}}.

6000|$|Clementina {{noticed that}} Mrs. Milray had {{got a new}} way of talking. She had a chirpiness, and a lift in her inflections, which if it was not exactly English was no longer Western American. Clementina herself in her {{association}} with Hinkle had worn off her English rhythm, and in her long confinement to the conversation of Mrs. Lander, she had reverted to her clipped Yankee accent. Mrs. Milray professed to like it, and said it brought back so delightfully those pleasant days at Middlemount, when Clementina really was a child. [...] "I met somebody at Cairo, who seemed very glad to hear about you, though he tried to seem not. Can you guess who it was? I see that you never could, in the world! We got quite chummy one day, when we were going out to the pyramids together, and he gave himself away, finely. He's a simple soul! But when they're in love they're all so! It was a little queer, colloguing with the ex-headwaiter on society terms; but the head-waitership was merely an episode, and the main thing is that he is very talented, and {{is going to be a}} minister. It's a pity he's so devoted to his crazy missionary scheme. Some one ought to get hold of him, and point him in the direction of a rich New York congregation. He'd find heathen enough among them, and he could do the greatest amount of good with their money; <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it into him. I suppose you saw him in Florence, this spring?" [...] she suddenly asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{women were}} over-excited, and when <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them they crowded round me and began jeering and shrieking {{at me because}} I am not married. A dozen screamed at a time, and so rapidly that I could not {{understand}} all they were saying, yet I {{was able to make}} out that they were taking advantage of the absence of their husbands to give me the full volume of their contempt. Some little boys who were listening threw themselves down, writhing with laughter among the seaweed, and the young girls grew red and embarrassed and stared down in the surf.' The book is full of such scenes. Now it is a crowd going by train to the Parnell celebration, now it is a woman cursing her son who made himself a spy for the police, now it is an old woman keening at a funeral. Kindred to his delight in the harsh grey stones, in the hardship of the life there, in the wind and in the mist, there is always delight in every moment of excitement, whether it is but the hysterical excitement of the women over the pigs, or some primary passion. Once indeed, the hidden passion instead of finding expression by its choice among the passions of others shows itself in the most direct way of all, that of dream. 'Last night,' he writes, at Innismaan, 'after walking in a dream among buildings with strangely intense light on them, I heard a faint rhythm of music beginning far away on some stringed instrument.|$|E
60|$|Presently, {{continuing}} my journey, I {{caught sight}} of a little hovel where the fir-branch over the door told me wine was to be obtained. I fastened my horse to a ring in the wall, and, going in, found an aged crone who gave me a glass of that thin white wine, produce of the last year's vintage, which is called Vino de la Hoja, wine of the leaf; {{she looked at me}} incuriously as though she saw so many people and they were so much alike that none repaid particular scrutiny. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her, for it seemed a curious life that she must lead, alone in that hut many miles from the nearest hamlet, with never a house in sight; but she was taciturn and eyed me now with something like suspicion. I asked for food, but with a sullen frown she answered that she had none to spare. I inquired the distance to Luisiana, a village on the way to Ecija where I had proposed to lunch, and shrugging her shoulders, she replied: 'How should I know!' I was about to go when I heard a great clattering, and a horseman galloped up. He dismounted and walked in, a fine example of the Andalusian countryman, handsome and tall, well-shaved, with close-cropped hair. He wore elaborately decorated gaiters, the usual short, close-fitting jacket, and a broad-brimmed hat; in his belt were a knife and a revolver, and slung across his back a long gun. He would have made an admirable brigand of comic-opera; but was in point of fact a farmer riding, as he told me, to see his novia, or lady-love, at a neighbouring farm.|$|E

I could not for [...] my life tell whether surprise, or a feeling of mischievous [...] satisfaction, was predominant. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him as he used to [...] talk to me; but I had not the gift of persuasion, or he the power of [...] understanding the words of wisdom. He insisted our situation was [...] different--that his unhappy birth, as he termed it, freed him at [...] least from dependence on his father's absolute will--that he had, by [...] bequest from some relative of his mother, a moderate competence, [...] which Miss Mowbray had consented to share with him; in fine, that he [...] desired not my counsel but my assistance. A moment's consideration [...] convinced me, that I should be unkind, not to him only, but to [...] myself, unless I gave him all the backing I could in this his most [...] dutiful scheme. I recollected our right honourable father's [...] denunciations against Scottish marriages, and secret marriages of [...] all sorts,--denunciations perhaps not the less vehement, that he [...] might feel some secret prick of conscience on the subject himself. I [...] remembered that my grave brother had always been a favourite, and I [...] forgot not--how was it possible I could forget--those ominous [...] expressions, which intimated a possibility of the hereditary estate [...] and honours being transferred to the elder, instead of the younger [...] son. Now, it required no conjurer to foresee, that should Francis [...] commit this inexpiable crime of secretly allying himself with a [...] Scottish beauty, our sire would lose all wish to accomplish such a [...] transference in his favour; and while my brother's merits were [...] altogether obscured by such an unpardonable act of disobedience, my [...] own, no longer overshadowed by prejudice or partiality, would shine [...] forth in all their natural brilliancy. These considerations, which [...] flashed on me with the rapidity of lightning, induced me to consent [...] to hold Frank's back-hand, during the perilous game he proposed to [...] play. I had only to take care that my own share in the matter should [...] not be so prominent as to attract my father's attention; and this I [...] was little afraid of, for his wrath was usually of that vehement and [...] forcible character, which, like lightning, is attracted to one [...] single point, there bursting with violence as undivided as it was [...] uncontrollable.|$|E
