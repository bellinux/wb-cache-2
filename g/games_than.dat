5|$|Everton has staged more top-flight {{football}} <b>games</b> <b>than</b> {{any other}} club in England, eight more seasons than second placed Aston Villa. Everton have played at Goodison Park {{for all but}} 4 of their 106 league seasons, giving Goodison Park the distinction of hosting more top-flight <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other ground in England. Goodison is the only English club ground to have hosted a FIFA World Cup semi final. Until the expansion of Old Trafford in 1996 Goodison Park held the record Sunday attendance on a Football League ground (53,509 v West Bromwich Albion, FA Cup, 1974).|$|E
5|$|It {{has hosted}} more top-flight <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other stadium in England. Goodison has hosted {{the maximum number}} of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have {{remained}} in the top tier of English football since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1890, Young's {{major league}} debut, he pitched a three-hit 8 - 1 {{victory over the}} Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a {{baseball}} statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other battery in baseball history.|$|E

5|$|Hammett first {{represented}} New Zealand, {{while he}} was a pupil at St Thomas of Canterbury College, when selected for the New Zealand Under 17 team in 1989. He then captained the Under 19 team in 1991, before making his first appearance for Canterbury in 1992. Although his one game for Canterbury in 1992 was as a replacement, he played seven games the following season. As hooker, he played mainly as backup to Matt Sexton in 1993; however, by 1994 they were sharing the role. By 1995, Hammett played more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> Sexton.|$|E
5|$|Statistician Jeff Sonas, in {{examining}} data from 266,000games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's Elo rating advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 {{if it is}} better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in rapid <b>games</b> <b>than</b> in games at a slower ("classical") time control. In the 462 games played at the 2009 World Blitz Chess Championship, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L 34.63).|$|E
5|$|The Aggie Band {{is unique}} among college bands; no other band eats and lives {{together}} as a military unit, even at the Service Academies and military colleges. Bandsmen wear their cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets.|$|E

5|$|The channel shared {{professional}} team coverage {{rights with}} some Detroit area broadcast television stations until {{the spring of}} 2008. In March 2008, the channel signed new long-term contracts with the Pistons, Red Wings and Tigers to broadcast more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> in previous years, becoming the exclusive local home of all three teams {{for the first time}} until at least 2018.

5|$|The {{following}} season, the Lakers won 11 fewer {{regular season}} <b>games</b> <b>than</b> the prior year, but swept {{the first three}} rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio. They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime, the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history until the Golden State Warriors broke it in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Germany's Miroslav Klose equalled the Brazilian Cafu as {{the player}} with most matches {{being on the}} winning side at the World Cup, with 16 victories. Klose played his 23rd World Cup match, equalling Paolo Maldini on 2nd place on most World Cup matches, with only Lothar Matthäus {{remaining}} with more (25). Klose has played in more knockout <b>games</b> <b>than</b> Matthäus or Cafu – 13, and also became the only player {{to take part in}} four World Cup semi-finals (Uwe Seeler previously played in three semi-finals). In the match, he broke the record for the most goals scored at the World Cup with 16, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo's total of 15; Ronaldo was in attendance at the match as a commentator. Thomas Müller's goal was Germany's 2,000th in the history of their national team. Müller became the third player in history to score five or more goals in two different World Cups (after Klose and the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas) and the second player to score five or more goals in consecutive World Cups (after Klose). Toni Kroos' first-half double scored in 69 seconds was the fastest pair of goals scored in World Cup history by the same player.|$|E

He scored {{his first two}} goals of the game against Dan Blackburn and his third into an empty net. Despite missing 10 games from his suspension, Bertuzzi finished the 2001–02 season third in league-scoring with 85 points, behind Näslund and Calgary Flames forward Jarome Iginla. His 1.18 points-per-game average ranked second in the league behind Mario Lemieux, who played 48 fewer <b>games</b> <b>than</b> Bertuzzi. He also improved his plus-minus rating by 39 points from the previous season, finishing a career-high +21. Although the Canucks were the league's highest scoring team, they finished with the final seed in the West for the 2002 playoffs, ranking eighth in their conference. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Bertuzzi recorded four points during the series.|$|E
5|$|Leblanc first {{participated in}} an {{international}} tournament when he played for the Canadian national junior team at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in August 2008. He led the team with three goals and added two assists for five points as Canada won the gold medal. Leblanc was then invited {{to try out for}} the national junior team prior to the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, but {{was one of the last}} players cut from the team. There was speculation that his participation in the NCAA rather than the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) hindered his chances of making the team, as CHL players had played considerably more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> those in the NCAA. Leblanc also had university exams scheduled around the time of the camp. He was invited to the summer camp the following year in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and was one of the top scorers at the camp. After the pre-tournament camp in December 2010, Leblanc was named to the final roster for the 2011 World Juniors.|$|E
5|$|Sayers' {{record of}} 22 {{touchdowns in a}} season was broken by O. J. Simpson in 1975, who scored 23; his 22 touchdowns remains a rookie record as of 2017. Sayers remains the most recent player to score at least six touchdowns in a game. His career kickoff return average of 30.56 yards is an NFL record for players with at least 75 attempts, and {{he is one of}} several players to have scored two return touchdowns in a game. He is tied with four other players for the second most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. Sayers' rookie record of 2,272 {{all-purpose}} yards was broken in 1988 by Tim Brown, who gained 2,317 yards through 16 games, two more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> Sayers set the record in. His single-season all-purpose yards record of 2,440 set in 1966 was broken in 1974 by Mack Herron, who surpassed it by four yards.|$|E

5|$|The National Basketball Association's Sixth Man of the Year Award is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1982–83 NBA season to the league's best {{performing}} player {{for his team}} coming off the bench as a substitute (or sixth man). A panel of sportswriters and broadcasters from throughout the United States and Canada votes on the recipient. Each judge casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The player with the highest point total, regardless {{of the number of}} first-place votes, wins the award.

5|$|Constantine I (r. 306–337) {{preferred}} chariot {{racing to}} gladiatorial combat, which he considered a vestige of paganism. However, {{the end of}} gladiatorial games in the Empire {{may have been more}} the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the <b>games,</b> <b>than</b> the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) in 393, perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport. Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during {{the early days of the}} Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457–474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{away from}} Merton at a {{supposedly}} temporary home, Wimbledon {{set a record}} for the lowest-ever English top-flight attendance on 22 August 1992 with 3,759 watching the clash with Coventry City, before breaking it twice more: 12 December 1992 against Oldham Athletic with 3,386, and finally on 26 January 1993, drawing only 3,039 fans to a Tuesday-night match against Everton, with reportedly 1,500 travelling from Liverpool. All ten of the Premier League's lowest attendances were Wimbledon home matches in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. However the general trend {{was one of a}} sharp rise—the club's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8,000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18,000 during the 1998–99 Premier League season. Wimbledon's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non-League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams. According to statistics compiled in 2000, 56% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders were locally born (the second lowest in the Premier League), and only 12% had fathers who were Wimbledon fans. Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and safer than other clubs in the capital—Wimbledon had more women and children at their <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other top-flight club. In 2000, 23% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders earned over £50,000 a year, the second-highest in the division after Chelsea (33%).|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Booth {{recorded his}} first career NHL natural hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks on November 9, 2008. He scored all the Panthers goals against Jean-Sébastien Giguère in a 3–1 {{win over the}} Anaheim Ducks. The following month, he sustained a left shoulder injury that sidelined him for eight games. After returning, he began an eight-game point-scoring streak that lasted from December 27, 2008, to January 10, 2009. Later in the season, he recorded another hat trick in a contest against the St. Louis Blues on March 7, 2009. Scoring all three goals against Chris Mason, Booth helped the Panthers to a 5–3 win. His efforts made him the fourth player in team history to register two hat-tricks in one season, after Pavel Bure, Ray Sheppard and Olli Jokinen. He also added an assist for a four-point game. Booth bettered that single-game total during the last contest of the regular season, scoring two goals and three assists for a personal best five-point effort in a 7–4 win against the Washington Capitals on April 11, 2009. Booth finished the season with career-highs of 31 goals, 29 assists and 60 points over 72 games. While leading the Panthers in goals, powerplay goals (11), game-winning goals (5; tied with Nathan Horton, and shots (246), he finished one point behind team-leader Stephen Weiss (who played six more <b>games</b> <b>than</b> Booth). Booth's efforts helped the Panthers compete for a playoff spot {{late in the season}} {{for the first time in}} his tenure with the club. They finished the season tied for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with the Montreal Canadiens at 41 wins and 93 points each. The Canadiens earned the spot over the Panthers by virtue of having won the season series between the two teams.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Constantine's 1928 {{tour was}} {{generally}} successful; {{only in the}} three Test matches, the first played by the West Indies, was he less effective. Although he took the West Indies' first wicket in Test cricket, dismissing Charlie Hallows, and finished with innings figures of four for 82, he took only one more wicket during {{the remainder of the}} series and ended with five wickets at an average of 52.40; with the bat, he scored 89 runs in six innings at 14.83. Even so, Jack Hobbs said that Constantine's opening overs to him in the first Test were among the fastest he ever faced, Constantine believed his captain, Karl Nunes, over-bowled him; the pair did not get along well. When the tour ended, Constantine had scored more runs and taken more wickets and catches in first-class <b>games</b> <b>than</b> any other tourist. He was second in the team's batting averages with 1,381 runs at 34.52, and led the bowling averages with 107 wickets at 22.95. It was the manner in which Constantine played which set him apart from the restrained form of cricket generally played in England at the time: his style, aggression and entertainment value made a big impression on the crowds. According to Peter Mason in his biography of Constantine, he established a unique style of West Indian cricket and possibly established the template for West Indian cricketers for years to come.|$|E
