Mrs. Makely was clearly proud of it, and expected me to applaud it; but I waited for her to speak, which upon the whole she probably liked as well.|$|E

See, too, that she lacks for nothing which we can give her who <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> Let the white lord, Mauriti, accompany her to the hut and be shown that next to it in which he and Macumazahn will sleep, so that he may be sure that she is safe, and attend to the horses if he wills. There is a place to tether them behind the huts, and the men who travelled with you will help him. Afterwards, when I have spoken with him, Macumazahn can join them that they may eat before they sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{received}} your letter, {{my dearest}} friend, by this day's post, {{and wrote a}} little note directly to the office as a trap for the feet of your travellers. If they escape us after all, therefore, they may praise their stars for it rather than my intentions--our intentions, I should say, for Robert will gladly do everything he can {{in the way of}} expounding a text or two of the glories of Florence, and we both shall be much pleased and cordially pleased to learn more of Fanny and her brother than the glance at Pisa could teach us. As for me, she will let me have a little talking for my share: I can't walk about or see anything. I lie here flat on the sofa in order to be wise; I rest and take port wine by wineglasses; and a few more days of it will prepare me, I hope and trust, for an interview with the Venus de' Medici. Think of my having been in Florence since Tuesday, this being Saturday, and not a step taken into the galleries. It seems a disgrace, a sort of involuntary disgraceful act, or rather no-act, which to complain of relieves one to some degree. And how kind of you to wish to hear from me of myself! There is nothing really much the matter with me; I am just weak, sleeping and eating dreadfully well considering that Florence isn't seen yet, and 'looking well,' too, says Mrs. Jameson, who, with her niece, <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> just now. It would have been wise if I had rested longer at Pisa, but, you see, there was a long engagement to meet Mrs. Jameson here, and she expressed a very kind unwillingness to leave Italy without keeping it: also she had resolved to come out of her way on purpose for this, and, as I had the consent of my physician, we determined to perform our part of the compact; and in order to prepare for the longer journey I went out in the carriage a little too soon, perhaps, and a little too long. At least, if I had kept quite still I should have been strong by this time--not that I have done myself harm in the serious sense, observe--and now the affair is accomplished, I shall be wonderfully discreet and self-denying, and resist Venuses and Apollos like some one wiser than the gods themselves. My chest is very well; there has been no symptom of evil in that quarter.... We took the whole coupé of the diligence--but regretted our first plan of the vettura nevertheless--and now are settled in very comfortable rooms in the 'Via delle Belle Donne' just out of the Piazza Santa Maria Novella, very superior rooms to our apartment in Pisa, in which we were cheated to the uttermost with all the subtlety of Italy and to the full extent of our ignorance; think what that must have been! Our present apartment, with the hire of a grand piano and music, does not cost us so much within ever so many francisconi. Oh, and you don't frighten me though we are {{on the north side of}} the Arno! We have taken our rooms for two months, and may be here longer, and the fear of the heat was stronger with me than the fear of the cold, or we might have been in the Pitti and 'arrostiti' by this time. We expected dear Mrs. Jameson on Saturday, but she came on Friday evening, having suddenly remembered that it was Shakespeare's birthday, and bringing with her from Arezzo a bottle of wine to 'drink to his memory with two other poets,' so there was a great deal of merriment, as you may fancy, and Robert played Shakespeare's favorite air, 'The Light of Love,' and everybody was delighted to meet everybody, and Roman news and Pisan dullness were properly discussed on every side. She saw a good deal of Cobden in Rome, and went with him to the Sistine Chapel. He has no feeling for art, and, being very true and earnest, could only do his best to try to admire Michael Angelo; but here and there, where he understood, the pleasure was expressed with a blunt characteristic simplicity. Standing before the statue of Demosthenes, he said: 'That man is persuaded himself of what he speaks, and will therefore persuade others.' She liked him exceedingly. For my part, I should join in more admiration if it were not for his having accepted money, but paid patriots are no heroes of mine. 'Verily they have their reward.' O'Connell had arrived in Rome, and it was considered that he came only to die. Among the artists, Gibson and Wyatt were doing great things; she wishes us to know Gibson particularly. As to the Pope he lives in an atmosphere of love and admiration, and 'he is doing what he can,' Mrs. Jameson believes. Robert says: 'A dreadful situation, after all, for a man of understanding and honesty! I pity him from my soul, for he can, at best, only temporise with truth.' But human nature is doomed to pay a high price for its opportunities. Delighted I am to have your good account of dear Mr. Martin, though you are naughty people to persist in going to England so soon. Do write to me and tell me all about both of you. I will do what I can--like the Pope--but what can I do? Yes, indeed, I mean to enjoy art and nature too; one shall not exclude the other. This Florence seems divine as we pass the bridges, and my husband, who knows everything, is to teach and show me all the great wonders, so that I am reasonably impatient to try my advantages. His kind regards to you both, and my best love, dearest friends....|$|E

40|$|John Randolph, {{assistant}} professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> on the show this week. His book The House in the Garden: The Bakunin Family and the Romance of Russian Idealism (Cornell University Press, 2007) has just appeared. As a sometime Russian historian myself, I was very interested in reading the book. I knew a bit about Mikhail Bakunin, the Russian anarchist famous for running around nineteenth-century Europe fomenting revolution, but I knew virtually nothing about his family. I 2 ̆ 7 d guess {{the same is true of}} many of you. John traces the Bakunins from their earliest days to the mid-nineteenth century, and along the way significantly revises the history of Russian radicalism in the period. The book is a model for historians who wish to weave together the private and the public, the personal and the political, the familial and the social. Highly recommended...|$|E

5000|$|While Beauty and the Beasts several {{theatrical}} re-releases and reissues {{have been}} met with generally mixed reviews, critical response towards the [...] "Be Out Guest" [...] musical sequence has remained predominantly positive. Reviewing the 2001 IMAX re-release of the film, the Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon felt that {{the inclusion of the}} deleted song [...] "Human Again" [...] was unnecessary, preferring [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and writing, [...] "a second major production number simply isnt needed; <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>is</b> sufficient." [...] Similarly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencers William Arnold wrote, [...] "On the other hand, its understandable why Again" [...] was cut from the original. Its almost too similar to the films show-stopper, <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> Guest." [...] Reviewing the films 2012 3D conversion, Todd Gilchrist of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Be <b>Our</b> Guest" [...] <b>is</b> [...] "effective, immersive and maybe even memorable." [...] Meanwhile, Annlee Ellingson of Paste wrote, [...] "Its thrilling to experience this films major set pieces on the big screen again, especially the Broadway-infused <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> number." [...] The Times-Picayunes Mike Scott wrote, [...] "But then the 3-D all but disappears until the <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> number -- with its artfully surreal dance of the dishes." [...] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, who otherwise criticized the films songs, praised [...] "Be Our Guest", writing, [...] "Apart from the spectacular Busby Berkeleyesque <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest,</b> the film pretty much grinds to a halt whenever one of the songs ... starts up." [...] Likewise, Neil Smith of Total Film concluded that [...] "only ‘Be Our Guest’ and the ballroom swoop really benefit from a stereoscopic make-over that doesn’t do the hand-drawn remainder many favours." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansburys performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singers delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent ... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disneys first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> ... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "Be <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> ... <b>is</b> the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly Under the Sea extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleibermans review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest,</b> ... sorry to say, is no Under the Sea." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrums Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, <b>Be</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Guest,</b> in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, Under the Sea. But its just under par." ...|$|R

500|$|Additionally {{described}} as [...] "a spark of Gallic vaudeville that lights a flame to both [...] Maurice Chevalier and Yves Montand," [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] depicts both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "humour." [...] Extending a warm, energetic invitation towards Belle, the first verse {{of the song}} is preceded by a spoken introduction. It reads, at first in French, [...] "Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now {{we invite you to}} relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents: your dinner," [...] immediately succeeded by the sung lyrics [...] "Be <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> put <b>our</b> service to the test," [...] continuing with [...] "Go on, unfold your menu / take a glance and then you'll / <b>be</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> / oui, <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> / <b>be</b> <b>our</b> guest." [...] A nostalgic Lumiere muses about being human, pining for the [...] "good old days when we were useful." [...] Furthermore, Lumiere voices his need to serve, singing, [...] "Life is so unnerving/For a servant who's not serving." ...|$|R
