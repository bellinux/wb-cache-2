500|$|In 1971, Brown {{sold his}} {{interest}} in KFC to Heublein for $284 million (. Using some of the profits from the KFC sale, Brown and some associates bought the Miami-based Lum's chain of restaurants from its founders, Stuart and Clifford S Perlman, for $4 million. Of the 340-outlet beer-and-hot-dog chain, Brown said [...] "they did not have very good food. I figured that upgrading <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> first task." [...] Accordingly, he hired {{a group of young}} executives to find [...] "the perfect hamburger". A month later, he hired Ollie Gleichenhaus, owner of a hamburger restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida, to train Lum's staff to create his hamburgers. He later started a chain of drive-through restaurants called Ollie's Trolley, named for Gleichenhaus, but the franchise failed. Lions Club International at Tampa, Florida, honored Brown with its Service to America Award in 1974. Brown sold the Lum's chain for $9.5 million to Friedrich Jahn's Wienerwald holding group in 1978. A few years later, Brown launched John Y's Chicken, a venture which also subsequently failed.|$|E
500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E

6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] said Tom, {{looking up}} {{suddenly}} from his meditative {{view of the}} tablecloth, [...] "I don't think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> right for <b>my</b> aunt Moss to pay the money if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> against <b>my</b> father's will for her to pay it; would it?" ...|$|R

2500|$|On June 15 Voris led {{a trio of}} Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats, {{specially}} {{modified to}} reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at the Southern Air Show at Jacksonville, Florida's Craig Field. The group, known simply as the [...] "Navy Flight Exhibition Team," [...] thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by [...] "...keeping something {{in front of the}} crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> naval career." [...] The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home in Naval Air Station Pensacola.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 Wimbledon Championships, Evert beat Mandlíková in the final. [...] Most of the {{pressure}} was {{the fact of the}} dodgy weather overhead, but this would not materialize into anything; by the time Evert looked up a mere hour later she had her third Wimbledon title in tow with the match score at 6 games to 2 for both sets. [...] The only major struggle happened in the second game of the first set in which Evert survived two break points to level the set at one game all, and in the subsequent game broke her opponent's serve. [...] In addition, Evert had many 40-love points on her serve and love-40 points on her opponent's serve that made way for her to play freer and more aggressive because she said [...] "winning Wimbledon is no easy thing." [...] Evert said of herself being perceived by her opponent that [...] "she thought I was getting older and better...her instinct told her <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> year." ...|$|E

6000|$|The chilly fingers still {{detained}} him and Palliser {{said very}} quietly, “One never knows what may happen, Tony; but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> wish {{that you and}} Violet did not wait very long.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in <b>my</b> case," [...] he said. [...] "The {{difficulty}} is that I should run a heavy risk if the effort was ever made. Now, however, I had, perhaps, better show you how far we have got with the tramway." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> advisable, <b>my</b> dear," [...] said Mrs. Wortley; [...] "it would seem like putting {{yourself}} in opposition to Mrs. Lyddell, and might be pledging yourself, in a manner, to recommend her, which, with your opinion of her, you could not well do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So pretty! So awfully pretty!" [...] Thereupon she curtsied.

6000|$|... "So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands," [...] replied Gurth; [...] "but this {{is none of}} these.
