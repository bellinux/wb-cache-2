40|$|The {{actomyosin}} cytoskeleton is {{a primary}} force-generating mechanism in morphogenesis, thus a robust spatial control of cytoskeletal positioning is essential. In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic Ciona notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell <b>elongation.</b> Intriguingly, <b>rings</b> always form at the cells′ anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events...|$|R
40|$|Protein ubiquitination {{involves}} E 1, E 2, and E 3 trienzyme cascades. E 2 and RING E 3 enzymes often collaborate {{to first}} prime a substrate {{with a single}} ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E 3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E 2 s, UBE 2 C (aka UBCH 10) and UBE 2 S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE 2 C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain <b>elongation,</b> the <b>RING</b> does not bind UBE 2 S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE 2 S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys 11 -linked chain. Our findings define mechanisms of APC/C regulation, and establish principles by which specialized E 3 -E 2 -substrate-UB architectures control different forms of polyubiquitination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{synthesized}} novel ubiquinone analogs by hybridizing {{the natural}} ubiquinone ring (2, 3 -dimethoxy- 5 -methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone) and hydrophobic phenoxybenzamide unit, and named them hybrid ubiquinones (HUs). The HUs worked as electron transfer substrates with bovine heart mitochondrial succinate–ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II) and ubiquinol–cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), {{but not with}} NADH–ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). With complex I, they acted as inhibitors in a noncompetitive manner against exogenous short-chain ubiquinones irrespective {{of the presence of}} the natural ubiquinone <b>ring.</b> <b>Elongation</b> of the distance between the ubiquinone ring and the phenoxybenzamide unit did not recover the electron accepting activity. The structure/activity study showed that high structural specificity of the phenoxybenzamide moiety is required to act as a potent inhibitor of complex I. These findings indicate that binding of the HUs to complex I is mainly decided by some specific interaction of the phenoxybenzamide moiety with the enzyme. It is of interest that an analogous bulky and hydrophobic substructure can be commonly found in recently registered synthetic pesticides the action site of which is mitochondrial complex I...|$|R
40|$|Following {{evidence}} for an east [...] west elongated virial {{ring around the}} Coma galaxy cluster in a ∼ 220 GeV VERITAS mosaic, we search for corresponding signatures in >GeV γ-rays from Fermi-LAT, and in soft, ∼ 0. 1 keV X-rays from ROSAT. For the <b>ring</b> <b>elongation</b> and orientation inferred from VERITAS, we find a 3. 4 σ LAT excess, and detect (> 5 σ) the expected signature in ROSAT bands R 1 and R 1 +R 2. The significances of both LAT and ROSAT signals are maximal near the VERITAS ring parameters. The intensities of the ROSAT, Fermi, and VERITAS signals {{are consistent with the}} virial shock depositing ∼ 0. 3 % (with an uncertainty factor of ∼ 3) of its energy over a Hubble time in a nearly flat, p≡ - d N_e/d E≃ 2. 0 [...] 2. 2 spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons. The sharp radial profiles of the LAT and ROSAT signals suggest preferential accretion in the plane of the sky, as indicated by the distribution of neighboring large-scale structure. The X-ray signal gauges the compression of cosmic-rays as they are advected deeper into the cluster. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, comments welcom...|$|R
40|$|Context In {{tropical}} areas, studies {{based on}} the retrospective analysis of tree development have focused principally on growth ring research. The interpretation of primary growth markers is overlooked although it opens perspectives to provide long time-series on tree-crown development. Aims This study focused on Parkia velutina, an emergent tree of neotropical rain forests. Our objectives were (1) to characterize the phenological cycle of this species, and (2) to identify temporally interpretable morphological and anatomical markers. Methods We collected dominant branches in 14 adult trees and identified growth markers that limit longitudinal and radial increments. We coupled this approach with a 2 -year phenological survey of 20 trees. Results Leaf shedding, growth unit <b>elongation</b> and growth <b>ring</b> formation define the phenological cycle. At tree scale, this cycle is synchronous and affects all axes. At population scale, trees can be desynchronized. This cycle is annual despite some slight variability. Successive growth units and growth rings are easily identifiable. Conclusion Dating a branch by {{counting the number of}} growth units or growth rings is possible in many years with a reasonable error. Nevertheless, estimating their precise month of formation in order to study climatic influences remains difficult. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|In a numerical, isopycnal, ocean {{model the}} mixing is {{investigated}} {{with the environment}} of two idealized Agulhas rings, one that splits, and one that remains coherent. The evolution of a passive tracer, initially contained within the rings, shows that tracer leakage {{is associated with the}} formation of filaments in the early stage of ring evolution. These filaments reach down to the thermocline. In the deepest layers leakage occurs on a larger scale. Self-advection of the rings is very irregular, and {{it is not possible to}} compute a Lagrangian boundary in order to estimate the transport of leakage from the rings. To describe the processes that govern tracer leakage, in a coordinate frame moving with the ring a kinematic separatrix is defined in the streamfunction field for the nondivergent flow. Initially, filaments arise because of the <b>elongation</b> of the <b>ring,</b> which is mainly governed by an m � 2 instability that is collaborating with differential rotation. Because of beta, the symmetry is destroyed related to the separatrix associated with a stagnation point in the flow. The filament upstream of the stagnation point grows much faster and is associated with the bulk of tracer leakage. Mixing is enhanced by time dependence of the separatrix. As a result, there are no large differences between the leakage from a coherent ring, where the m � 2 instability equilibrates, and from a splitting ring, where the m � 2 instability keeps growing, which confirms that the amount of leakage is mainly governed by the ring’s initial deformation combined with unsteady self-advection of the ring and not by the splitting of the ring. The decay of tracer content in the thermocline shows that in the first months up to 40 % of the ring water can be mixed with the environment. In deeper layers the decay of tracer content may reach up to 90 %. 1...|$|R
