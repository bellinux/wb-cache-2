25|$|After a {{four-year}} absence, Lucy Speed {{decided that she}} wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented “It was good timing. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> and the character fit the bill.” Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed. A friendship was also re-established between the characters Natalie and Bianca in a special four-hander episode – although “the closeness was never quite the same”.|$|E

[...] Paul Kolderie, who had worked at Fort Apache Studios with Smith, recommended the Boston recording studio Q Division to Albini. This created tension between Smith and Kolderie, and Kolderie later remarked that [...] "Gary almost killed me for the suggestion, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was scheming to get the project." ...|$|E

She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E

Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, yet he has gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall.

500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was going to get us killed." ...|$|E
500|$|The film stars Shiv Pandit and Dhruv Ganesh; {{the former}} {{came across the}} film's script during a casual meeting with Saria. In an {{interview}} with Daily News and Analysis, Pandit discussed the meeting between him and Saria, saying, [...] "He {{had no desire to}} cast me, [...] because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> do only commercial films. I had to force it out of him. But when I heard it I found it interesting and we decided to do it". Saria called Ganesh for the table read for the protagonist of the film, Sahil, and was greatly impressed by his approach to the character. However, Ganesh was apprehensive about playing the character, but after initial scepticism he agreed to play the role. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh J. Chaddha play supporting roles in the film. The film marked the last film role for Ganesh, as he died of tuberculosis in January 2015, while the film was in post-production. The opening credits in the film's final cut honour his memory.|$|E

500|$|Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973 in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up {{splitting}} {{time between}} the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, where {{he lived with his}} mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E

He was my hero. He told me about professional Scouting and said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would do a good job." [...] Mazzuca later achieved the Brotherhood Honor {{as a member of}} Esselen Lodge during the 1960s and served on Pico Blanco camp staff for two summers.

That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional.

[...] Only 24 wickets fell in the match, and both Jonathan Agnew and Paul Allott, rivals for a fast-bowling place, went wicketless. In the event, both Agnew and Allot were {{omitted from the}} next XI and Ellison was recalled for the fifth test. He remembers: [...] "When we got to Edgbaston I was advised not to play by Bernard Thomas (England physio) as I had a heavy cold. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would not get through five days.

He said, [...] "The director, Henry Hathaway, didn't want me. I have a high forehead; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> looked too intellectual." [...] Hathaway was overruled by studio boss Darryl F.

Kiss of Death was a commercial and critical success: Widmark won the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actor, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Widmark played [...] "Dude" [...] in the Western film Yellow Sky (1948), with Gregory Peck and Anne Baxter. His name was billed third, above the title.|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{has been}} {{involved}} in a number of controversies and incidents that have caused public concern and widespread media interest. During the 2001 election campaign, Prescott was campaigning in Rhyl, Denbighshire when farmer Craig Evans threw an egg at him, which struck him in the neck. Prescott, a former amateur boxer, responded immediately with a straight left to the jaw. The incident, overshadowing the launch of the Labour Party manifesto on that day, was captured by numerous television crews. Tony Blair responded succinctly, stating, [...] "John is John". A National Opinion Polls (NOP) survey found that the incident appeared to do no public harm to Prescott, and may even have benefited his standing amongst male voters. The incident {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Rumble in Rhyl".

2500|$|Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy, {{appeared}} in 2014. Admitting to having {{paid little attention}} to Liddle's journalism, Will Self, in his review for The Guardian wrote: [...] "it's so much more authoritative to hear a man condemned out of his own mouth over 200-plus pages than it is to assay him on the basis of newspaper columns, which, by and large, favour polarised views tendentiously expressed." [...] Despite his serious reservations about Liddle's writing, Self concludes: [...] "The peculiar thing is that I can't find it in my heart of hearts to dislike the man, I think there's good in him and that he can change his bilious complexion." [...] Liddle responded to Self's review in an interview with Archie Bland of The Independent a few weeks later: [...] "He reviewed what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was, not what the book was about. Bizarre. I think it's slightly deranged." ...|$|E

That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of women say they don't understand why women stay with them dogs.

In 2006, Wales said, [...] "He used to work for me [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as [...] "co-founder" [...] as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that [...] "Jimmy Wales contacted me and asked me to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc.

2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley.
