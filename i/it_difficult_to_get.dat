5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production found <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots {{on the set of}} The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E

Hyperspectral imaging from aircraft or satellites can provide remotely sensed reflectance spectra to help detect such graves.

25|$|During 1981, TVS's ambitions {{were soon}} {{recognised}} for {{their desire to}} have a greater say in how ITV operated and its dismay on how it was being treated by the Big Five ITV companies, Thames Television, LWT, Central Independent Television, Yorkshire Television and Granada Television. The rationale was that the larger ITV companies should bear more of the production costs as their size enabled them to. This led to criticism in some quarters that the larger of the remaining 'regional' ITV companies, such as TVS, Anglia Television, STV, Tyne Tees Television and HTV, found <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> network access for their major productions, and that they were left with softer non-primetime sectors, such as children's and religious television.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anything done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia {{was sent back to}} the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{unveiled}} on November 20, when Activision {{announced it was}} not going to be a direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after the events of the film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time. The game was next shown at E3 in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham liked the idea of the 360° combat system but found <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the camera system to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first game had failed to do) and admitted he was looking forward to the final build.|$|E

25|$|The Adelaide Oval is {{traditionally}} a dull, lifeless wicket with bounce {{so low that}} even the fastest bowlers rarely rise it above stump height and batsmen found <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball away. On this occasion frequent light rain helped freshen it up slightly for the pacemen and it resolutely refused to turn. England dropped their injured wicket-keeper John Murray and Alan Smith returned to the team. Tom Graveney was well again and replaced the out of form Peter Parfitt and the off-spinner Ray Illingworth was brought in for the fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell. Once again Fred Trueman advised the opposite, he thought an extra seamer would be better at Adelaide, but was ignored; in any case the spinners struggled on a pitch that refused to turn. Typically the selectors chose the out of form Illingworth over David Allen because of his superior batting. Barry Jarman was also dropped as Australia's first choice keeper Wally Grout was fit to play against after breaking his jaw in November and the paceman Colin Guest was dropped in favour of Ken Mackay in what would be his final Test. Richie Benaud now had 228 Test wickets, Fred Trueman 229 and Brian Statham 235, just one behind Alec Bedser's Test record of 236. Richie Benaud won the toss {{for the third time}} and chose to bat.|$|E

500|$|Partly {{because of}} this controversy, Joyce found <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a {{publisher}} to accept the book, but {{it was published in}} 1922 by Sylvia Beach from her well-known Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, John Rodker produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at Folkestone. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of [...] "bootleg" [...] versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher Samuel Roth. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.|$|E
