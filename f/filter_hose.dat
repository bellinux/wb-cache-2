40|$|Abstract: Fabric {{filters are}} used in the wide range of {{industrial}} technologies for cleaning of incoming or exhaust gases. To achieve maximal efficiency of the discrete phase separation and long lifetime of the <b>filter</b> <b>hoses,</b> it is necessary to ensure uniform load on filter surface and to avoid impacts of heavy particles with high velocities to the <b>filter</b> <b>hoses.</b> The paper deals with numerical simulation of two phase flow field in a large fabric filter. The filter is composed of six chambers with approx. 1600 <b>filter</b> <b>hoses</b> in total. The model was simplified to one half of the <b>filter,</b> the <b>filter</b> <b>hoses</b> walls were substituted by porous zones. The model settings were based on experimental data, especially on the filter pressure drop. Unsteady simulations with different turbulence models were done. Flow field together with particles trajectories were analyzed. The results were compared with experimenta...|$|R

50|$|Aircraft refuelers can {{be either}} a {{self-contained}} fuel truck, or a hydrant truck or cart. Fuel trucks are self-contained, typically containing up to 10,000 US gallons of fuel and have their own pumps, <b>filters,</b> <b>hoses,</b> and other equipment. A hydrant cart or truck hooks into a central pipeline network and provides fuel to the aircraft. There is a significant advantage with hydrant systems when compared to fuel trucks, as fuel trucks must be periodically replenished.|$|R

30|$|Monitoring the tPA {{activity}} of the particles using the S- 2288 assay, we showed that the cov. tPA@PAM-SPIONs show significantly higher fibrinolytic activity than the ads. tPA@PAM-SPIONs in vitro (Fig.  4 a). Interestingly, the fibrinolytic {{activity of}} cov. tPA@PAM-SPIONs was {{comparable to that of}} free tPA. This is surprising, because proteins have the tendency to adsorb to surfaces, resulting in a loss of significant amounts of tPA on <b>filters</b> and <b>hose</b> system during the necessary ultrafiltration process and so in a decrease in their measurable activity. We found that these issues result in loss of around 50  % activity after reconstitution in HEPES buffer and ultrafiltration compared to reconstitution in distilled water as shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1. Interestingly, the high difference in tPA activity could not be verified within agarose-fibrin matrices, where the effect of both particle systems were very similar (Fig.  4 d). Most likely, the adsorptive bound tPA detaches from the particles and diffuses more readily into the matrix than covalently bound tPA. However, particles with covalently bound tPA seem hypothetically more suitable for magnetic drug targeting, as those particles can be directed to and into a thrombus without stripping off the bioactive tPA enzyme. This topic will be investigated in detail in future studies.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design of {{hydrostatic}} drive for multipurpose loader and tool carrier DAPPER. At the beginning is research of different basic concepts and modern {{solutions to the}} problem, aided by {{a detailed description of}} competitive machine in the same performance category. Extensive comparison with other producers is included in the annexes to this thesis. Furthermore, a theoretical driving characteristic and its appropriateness is examined further on the basis of two model situations. The calculations of the individual components of the hydraulic circuit precedes drive kinematics analysis of articulated machine frame, on it final conception of hydrostatic drive is chosen. Firstly hydromotors and hydogenerator are chosen on the grounds of calculations then hydraulic <b>hoses,</b> <b>filters</b> and flow divider. Next chapters are aimed to calculations of hydraulic losses and thermal calculation of hydraulic circuit. Final part deals with introduction the final characteristics of drive. The practical parts of the work are assembly drawings with main power components and hydraulic schematic of drive...|$|R
40|$|In drought-prone {{northern}} California, homeowners {{can collect}} rainwater to irrigate their waterintensive summer vegetable gardens. Rainwater harvesting requires a three-part system: {{a method of}} collection (commonly the roof), a form of storage (cistern) and a method of distribution (a pump, <b>filter</b> and soaker <b>hose</b> are proposed here). To optimize and properly size a rainwater harvesting system, homeowners should consider both their rainwater supply and their garden’s water demand. Gardeners can reduce demand by planting early {{to take advantage of}} spring rains and by grouping crops according to irrigation needs. The authors analyze the water use of a sample garden, which they adapt to both Berkeley and Sacramento. In both of these cities, one can collect more than enough rainwater to support a small vegetable garden: an individual homeowner’s water supply {{is more likely to be}} limited by storage capacity than rainfall. Ultimately, although rainwater harvesting can supply adequate quantities of water to irrigate vegetable gardens, the level of water treatment required to safely irrigate food crops adds dramatically to the cost of a system. For a smaller investment, rainwater harvesting can be used to irrigate landscaping vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Let’s {{take a shot}} at the fables {{handed down}} through the years to Koi Pond Enthusiasts around the world. Number one- It was told to me that using certain {{chemicals}} would devastate my filter and pond of “beneficial bacteria”. Number two- It was told to me that washing out my filter media with anything but pond water would wash off the “beneficial bacteria”. Number three- It was told to me that major water changes would eliminate most of the disease pathogens in my pond. Well… … DON’T BELIEVE IT! Why it isn’t so……… Most of these beliefs are {{based on the idea that}} all pond microbes are planktonic (free-floating), and that simply is not true. Many of the microbes in your pond have the capability to adhere to surfaces, and actually demonstrate cell-communications to determine which medium to thrive on. Surface-designed Microbial Ponds have the capability to perform all of the functions for a successful Nitrogen Cycle without the use of a filter. Our verification test pond has enough surface area alone to maintain negligible nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia levels with the filter turned off for days. Although, filtration is usually required for fugitive particulate, and waste removal. I will start explaining why this isn’t the case by explaining what a Biofilm is, and that this formation is virtually indestructible. A Biofilm is a community of microorganisms attached to a solid surface. These microbes (bacteria, fungi, algae, etc.) can form on a solid surface that comes in contact with water such as- pond liners, foam <b>filters,</b> rocks, <b>hoses,</b> piping, human skin, FISH (Slime Coat), plants, pots, etc. It is the leading cause of many nosocomial infections in hospitals growing inside of catheters, and implanted devices. The formation of a Biofilm starts with the adhesion of a microbe to the surface. Some microbes stay attached by proteinaceous appendages referred to as fimbraiae (filament type legs). Once a number of fimbraie have glued the microbe to the surface, dislodging the microbe is highly unlikely. They form a spider-web formation on the surfac...|$|R
40|$|Over 2 {{million workers}} are {{potentially}} exposed to respirable crystalline silica with {{the overwhelming majority}} in the construction industry. Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica can lead to silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse diseases. The present research evaluated novel designs in both traditional ventilation and local exhaust ventilation for a concrete dowel drill to reduce occupational exposures such as silica. The first study investigated traditional ventilation novel designs to increase capture velocities without increasing fan speeds or power consumption. The second and third study focused on improving a concrete dowel drill local exhaust ventilation design to reduce potential respirable crystalline silica exposures during large concrete construction project such as airport runways. Previous research indicated that the manufacturer’s local exhaust ventilation system reduced respirable crystalline silica exposures by over 90 percent but the system was susceptible to <b>filter</b> and <b>hose</b> clogging which reduced performance. In the second study, a laboratory study evaluated two novel local exhaust ventilation hoods, one commercially available hood, and the dowel drill manufacturer’s hood for hood efficiency and airflow characteristics. The novel design hoods increased hood coefficient of entry from 0. 59 for the manufacturer’s hood to 0. 64 indicating increased efficiency. Novel simple hood analysis found an average hood coefficient of entry of 0. 81 indicating further improvements can be made. In the third study, simulated workplace conditions were {{used to evaluate the}} best performance hood identified in laboratory testing along with other local exhaust ventilation modifications such as replacing the manufacturer’s corrugated hose with smooth-bore hose and including a cyclone pre-separator to reduce the dust transport burden within the exhaust system. The most effective local exhaust ventilation configuration consisted of the novel design hood, smooth-bore hose, and cyclone which reduced average accumulated hose weight (manufacturer’s configuration = 0. 3 pounds per trial vs. most effective configuration = 0. 05 pounds per trial) and increased average cleanout bucket capture (0. 95 pounds per trial to 6. 30 pounds per trial). These metrics indicated potential concrete dowel drill ventilation system efficiency and capture performance increases that address the ventilation system limitations indicated by previous research...|$|R
40|$|In {{the conduct}} of many processes, {{including}} during operation of the drying equipment is well proven two-stage purification scheme of the coolant, including units for dry and wet cleaning emissions. This article was reviewed the system of purification of air of the shop of drying specializing on production of food powders on the example of powder of soluble tea. Detected locations the emission of dust in shop of drying, by production of soluble food powders, parameters of the fulfilled dryer heat carrier are determined, physical and structural and mechanical properties of the received product are analyzed, and also overall performance {{of the means of}} purification of air existing at the enterprise is defined. It is revealed that when drying this powder emissions contain a big share of fine fraction of the dust possessing high hygroscopicity and big adhesive ability and use of the <b>hose</b> <b>filter</b> as the second step of cleaning is inadmissible. The average value of catching the cyclone was in the range of 72 - 76 %. This {{is due to the fact}} that this dust is characterized by the presence of a large percentage of the fine fraction, which is poorly captured by the centrifugal dry cleaning apparatus. After analyzing the effectiveness of existing treatment systems, it is possible to draw a conclusion about inexpediency of its use in the enterprise when the dust dispersed composition of this and the need to develop other, better and more effective option. Used conical cyclone is not very effective device for cleaning of coolant from fine dust, so its use is possible only as the first stage of two-stage air purification. From the obtained results it follows that the existing air cleaning system did not provide the required efficiency. To ensure the required level of purification of exhaust air should take into account the special properties of the dusts of a particular production. As the second stage in this case, with regard to the specific characteristics of this type of dust, it is advisable to use wet types of cleaning. It was suggested use for cleaning of the heat carrier of the wet device of centrifugal and inertial action is offered. The presented generalized characteristics of dust can serve as the material allowing to estimate danger degree in the sanitary and hygienic relation of this or that technological process and are basic data for calculation of an efficiency of the operating clearing equipment and design new...|$|R
