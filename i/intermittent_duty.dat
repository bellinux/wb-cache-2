40|$|The main {{objective}} of the original work presented in this Thesis {{is to develop a}} theoretical framework to understand the growth, cosmological evolution and observational features of the first black holes, formed when the Universe was younger than ∼ 1 Gyr. In the first part a growth model is assembled, based on the developed radiation hydrodynamic code GEMS (Growth of Early Massive Seeds). We find that the accretion onto a Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) of initial mass M_ 0 = 10 ^ 5 M_ occurs at an average, super-Eddington, rate Ṁ_∙≃ 1. 35 Ṁ_Edd≃ 0. 1 M_ yr^- 1, is intermittent (duty-cycle ≲ 50 %) and lasts ∼ 100 Myr, during which the black hole can accrete only up to ∼ 20 % of the available mass. Our model identifies a "feeding-dominated" accretion regime for massive DCBHs (≳ 10 ^ 5 - 6 M_) and a "feedback-limited" one for light ones (≲ 10 ^ 3 - 4 M_), the latter being characterized by <b>intermittent</b> (<b>duty</b> cycles ≲ 0. 5) and inefficient growth, with recurring outflow episodes.

40|$|LectureIn 2014 a {{full scale}} high {{viscosity}} pump performance test was performed for a 2 -stage vertically suspended (VS 1) API 610 pump. The high viscosity test scope {{was part of}} an ongoing EPC project and exclusively conducted for industrial purposes. The objective was to simulate real field operation with crude oil and qualify the pump for the given field conditions and requirements. Furthermore, the reason for conducting this test scope was the uncertainties in published methods of predicting high viscosity fluid pump characteristics, limited available literature, hence reduce field operation risks. The official test scope was divided into two main scenarios: 1) Start-up test at minimum. flow and a viscosity of 3075 cP, 2) Pump performance test with an <b>intermittent</b> <b>duty</b> point (reduced flow) of 850 m 3 /h- 125 m (3654 USgpm- 410 ft), and a viscosity of 1075 cP. Internal tests with various viscosities from 480 cP to 3075 cP were also done in preparation for the official tests. Measured results were then compared to published methods for pump characteristics viscosity correction. The objective for these additional analyzes was to evaluate possible alternative approaches in order to improve uncertainties with viscous prediction and ultimately reduce the number of tests/test scope in future projects. It should be emphasized that this comparison is simply for discussion within the industry and not for validation of published methods of viscosity correction for pump characteristics. The test results provide valuable insight on the effects of high viscosity on centrifugal pump performance curves, allowing a more accurate rating and possibly a better optimization of the process equipment, e. g. electrical motor, valves, cooling system, by improving the flow characteristics predictions...|$|E
40|$|Two harbor {{porpoises}} in {{a floating}} pen {{were subjected to}} five pure tone underwater signals of 70 or 120 kHz with different signal durations, amplitudes and duty cycles (% of time sound is produced). Some signals were continuous, others were <b>intermittent</b> (<b>duty</b> cycles varied between 8 % and 100 %). The effect of each signal was judged by comparing the animals¿ surfacing locations and number of surfacings (i. e. number of respirations) during test periods with those during baseline periods. In all cases, both porpoises {{moved away from the}} sound source, but the effect of the signals on respiration rates was negligible. Pulsed 70 kHz signals with a source level (SL) of 137 dB had a similar effect as a continuous 70 kHz signal with an SL of 148 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms). Also, a pulsed 70 kHz signal with an SL of 147 dB had a much stronger deterring effect than a continuous 70 kHz signal with a similar SL. For pulsed 70 kHz signals (2 s pulse duration, 4 s pulse interval, SL 147 dB re 1 ¿Pa, rms), the avoidance threshold sound pressure level (SPL), {{in the context of the}} present study, was estimated to be around 130 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 064 and around 124 dB (re 1 ¿Pa, rms) for porpoise 047. This study shows that ultrasonic pingers (70 kHz) can deter harbor porpoises. Such ultrasonic pingers have the advantage that they do not have a ¿dinner bell¿ effect on pinnipeds, and probably have no, or less, effect on other marine fauna, which are often sensitive to low frequency sounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{observational}} {{evidence that}} Super-Massive Black Holes (M_∙∼ 10 ^ 9 - 10 M_) {{are already in}} place less than 1 Gyr after the Big Bang poses stringent time constraints on the growth efficiency of their seeds. Among proposed possibilities, the formation of massive (∼ 10 ^ 3 - 6 M_) seeds and/or the occurrence of super-Eddington (Ṁ>Ṁ_Edd) accretion episodes {{may contribute to the}} solution of this problem. In this work we analytically and numerically investigate the accretion flow onto high-redshift (z ∼ 10) black holes to understand the physical requirements favoring rapid and efficient growth. Our model identifies a "feeding-dominated" accretion regime and a "feedback-limited" one, the latter being characterized by <b>intermittent</b> (<b>duty</b> cycles D≲ 0. 5) and inefficient growth, with recurring outflow episodes. We find that low-mass seeds (≲ 10 ^ 3 - 4 M_) evolve in the feedback-limited regime, while more massive seeds (≳ 10 ^ 5 - 6 M_) grow very rapidly as they are found in the feeding-dominated regime. In addition to the standard accretion model with a fixed matter-energy conversion factor (ϵ = 0. 1), we have also explored slim disk models, appropriate for super-Eddington accretion, where radiation is trapped in the disk and the radiative efficiency is reduced (ϵ≲ 0. 04), which may ensure a continuous growth with Ṁ≫Ṁ_Edd (up to ∼ 300 Ṁ_Edd in our simulations). Under these conditions, outflows play a negligible role and a black hole can accrete 80 %- 100 % of the gas mass of the host halo (∼ 10 ^ 7 M_) in ∼ 10 Myr, while in feedback-limited systems we predict that black holes can accrete only up to ∼ 15 % of the available mass.
