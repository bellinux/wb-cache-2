40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of {{reinforcement}} detailing on the behaviour of a reinforced concrete structure. Using a retaining wall as a case-study, the performance of two commonly used alternative reinforcement layouts (of which one is wrong) are studied and compared. Reinforcement Layout 1 had the main reinforcement (from the wall) bent towards the heel in the base slab. For Reinforcement Layout 2, the reinforcement was bent towards the toe. This study focused on the reinforcement details used in the D-region, and on how it impacts the capacity, joint efficiency and failure mode of the structure. First, a literature review is carried out which focused on the behaviour of corner joints from experimental works available in literature. Next, a strut and tie model of the D-region is made. From the strut and tie model, the opening moments acting on the structure subjects the re-entrant corner region to a concentration of tensile stresses, while a compressive stress field acts concurrently with transverse tension within {{the core of the}} joint. The internal forces within the D-region are evaluated, and the required steel areas computed. Afterwards, ATENA FEM software is used to model the structure, and to study {{the impact of}} the alternative reinforcement layouts on the capacity and behavior of the structure. Some aspects of the structural behavior studied include the stress and strain distribution in the concrete, crack width, crack pattern, steel stress and strain distribution etc. The results obtained from the FEM analysis was sensitive to bond model defined in the material model. When perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM analysis, Reinforcement Layout 1 attained a joint efficiency of 72. 4 %, while Reinforcement Layout 2 achieved 88 % joint efficiency. In his experimental works on similar details, Nilsson (1973) had obtained a joint efficiency of 60 % for Reinforcement Layout 1, a range between 82 % to 102 % for Reinforcement Layout 2. The disparity between FEM result and experimental result for Reinforcement Layout 1 occurred because perfect-bond was assumed in the FEM model. With cracking playing prominent role in this structure, perfect bond assumption is not valid, and some slip is inevitable. To verify, a bond-slip relation is used to model the structure, resulting in 62 % joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 1, and 82 % joint efficiency for Reinforcement Layout 2. These values obtained with bond-slip model are much closer to experimental values than those obtained with perfect bond. The reinforcement layout used also had significant impact on the joint behavior. In Reinforcement Layout 1, the reinforcement (tie) from the wall was not properly anchored in the nodal region in the slab. The compressive stress field (i. e. <b>inclined</b> <b>strut)</b> was observed to flow past the bent part of the reinforcement without much interaction. The force transfer between the <b>inclined</b> <b>strut</b> and the tie was not effective. Also, wide cracks occurred along the <b>inclined</b> <b>strut</b> from the action of transverse tension (caused by the opening moment). These cracks which further weakened the strut. This detail had a diagonal tension cracking failure mode. For Reinforcement Layout 2, a clearly defined nodal region exists. A CTT node formed allowed for effective force transfer (at the node) between the concrete and steel. Furthermore, the bent part of the reinforcement crossed the path of the <b>inclined</b> <b>strut,</b> and helped to control crack width. The reinforcement also provided confinement to the <b>inclined</b> <b>strut</b> which further increased its strength. This detail prevented diagonal tension cracking failure, hence the higher capacity it achieved. Failure was by crushing of concrete along the joint – slab interface, after formation of a wide vertical crack extending from the re-entrant corner downwards into the slab. Adding a diagonal bar, placed 45 ° around the re-entrant corner, helped to control this re-entrant corner crack, thus ensuring that over 100 % joint efficiency is achieved. In conclusion, Reinforcement Layout 1 is a poor detail. Though common in practice, a node is not properly formed in this detail, thus force transfer capacity between concrete and steel is not effective.

40|$|Simple {{but still}} {{realistic}} physical models suitable for structural design of flat concrete plates and column footings {{with respect to}} punching are presented. Punching of a flat plate is assumed to occur when the concrete compression strain at the column edge due to the bending moment in the slab reaches a critical value that is considerably lower than the generally accepted ultimate compression strain 0. 0035 for one-way structures loaded in bending. In compact slabs such as column footings the compression strength of the <b>inclined</b> <b>strut</b> from the load to the column is governing instead. Both the strain limit and the inclined stress limit display a size-effect, i. e. the limit values decrease with increasing depth of the compression zone in the slab. Due respect is also paid to increasing concrete brittleness with increasing compression strength. The influence of the bending moment means that flat plates with rectangular panels display a lower punching capacity than flat plates with square panels – a case that is not recognized by current design codes. As a consequence, punching shall be checked {{for each of the}} two reinforcement directions separately if the bending moments differ. Since the theory can predict the punching load as well as the ultimate deflection of test specimens with good precision, it can also treat the case where a bending moment, so called unbalanced moment, is transferred from the slab to the column. This opens up for a safer design than with the prevailing method. It is proposed that the column rotation in relation to the slab shall be checked instead of the unbalanced moment for both gravity loading and imposed story drift due to lateral loads. However, the risk for punching failure is a great disadvantage with flat plates. The failure is brittle and occurs without warning in the form of extensive concrete cracking and increased deflection. Punching at one column may even initiate punching at adjacent columns as well, which would cause progressive collapse of the total structure. A novel reinforcement concept is therefore presented that gives flat plates a very ductile behaviour, which eliminates the risk for punching failure. The performance is verified by tests with monotonic as well as cyclic loading. QC 2010092...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} a single-cavity, compact trapped vortex {{combustor}} concept showed good flame stability {{for a wide}} range of flow conditions. However, achieving good mixing between cavity products and mainstream flow was still a major challenge. In the present study, a passive mixing enhancement strategy of using <b>inclined</b> <b>struts</b> along with a flow guide vane is presented and experimentally tested at atmospheric pressure conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the energy absorption characteristics of plastically deformed <b>inclined</b> <b>struts</b> under impact loading. This information is needed to provide a usable method by which designers and analysts of shipping casks for radioactive or fissile materials can determine the energy absorption capabilities of external longitudinal fins on cylindrical casks under specified impact conditions. A survey of technical literature related to experimental determination of the dynamic plastic behavior of struts revealed no information directly applicable to the immediate problem, especially in the impact velocity ranges desired, and an experimental program was conducted to obtain the needed data. Mild-steel struts with rectangular cross sections were impacted by free-falling weights dropped from known heights. These struts or fin specimens were inclined at five different angles to simulate different angles of impact that fins on a shipping cask could experience under certain accident conditions. The resisting force of the deforming strut was measured and recorded as a function of time by using load cells instrumented with resistance strain gage bridges, signal conditioning equipment, an oscilloscope, and a Polaroid camera. The acceleration of the impacting weight was measured and recorded as a function of time during the latter portion of the testing program by using an accelerometer attached to the drop hammer, appropriate signal conditioning equipment, the oscilloscope, and the camera. A digital computer program was prepared to numerically integrate the force-time and acceleration-time data recorded during the tests to obtain deformation-time data. The force-displacement relationships were then integrated to obtain values of absorbed energy with respect to deformation or time. The results for various fin specimen geometries and impact angles are presented graphically, and these curves may be used to compute the energy absorption capacity of a longitudinal fin on a shipping cask as a function of its geometry and the percentage of deformation it is expected to experience as well as the peak force to which the fin would be subjected during the impact resulting from a 30 -foot free drop onto an essentially unyielding horizontal surface...|$|R
30|$|In {{a simple}} strut-and-tie model, the tensile {{force of the}} tie (bottom chord) is {{constant}} throughout the span (dT/dx =  0), so that beam action cannot be developed in the web shear element. Accordingly, the shear and moment must be fully resisted by the <b>inclined</b> top (<b>strut)</b> and bottom chords, as shown in Fig.  3 c. From {{the view of the}} present model, it is said that a simple strut-and-tie model is the extreme case of the present model when α is 1.0. On the other hand, a parallel chord truss model (dz/dx =  0 as seen in Fig.  3 b) cannot rely on the arch action to sustain shear, thus it is the other extreme case of the present model with α of 0. It may be realized therefore that the internal force flow of usual beams can be closely described by a proper assignment of the value of α, as conceptually illustrated in Fig.  3 d.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis is the investigation, analytical and experimental, of the mechanical behaviour of the structural elements whose function is to transfer load from a column {{to a group of}} piles. Pile caps are short elements featuring low shear span ratios, which requires strut-and-tie models for their design and detailing. In the experimental part of the research, conventional and non-conventional reinforcement arrangements are examined. The experimental results of the conventionally reinforced specimens showed that there is an upper limit for the amount of the tie reinforcement over which the ties do not develop their full strength and the failure load of the pile cap is determined by the strength of the <b>inclined</b> <b>struts.</b> This finding led the research towards the search of non-conventional reinforcement arrangements which would activate an additional strut-and-tie model in the pile cap and would maximize, for a given reinforcement - concrete ratio, the ultimate strength under concentric compressive loading. The experimental results of the non-conventionally reinforced specimens confirmed the activation of this additional load transfer mechanism and there was a 50 % increase in the failure load compared to that of the conventionally reinforced specimen with the same reinforcement - concrete ratio. Another objective of this research is the distribution of the column load among the piles of a statically indeterminate pile cap. In such a case, the column load is not uniformly distributed among the piles of the group. The proposed load distribution criterion predicts pile reactions that are in good agreement with the available experimental results. The product of the analytical investigation of the mechanical behaviour of pile caps with conventional and non-conventional reinforcement arrangements is the proposed strut-and-tie design methods. The validity of the proposed analytical methods was checked against experimental results which were taken from both the literature and the experimental work conducted in the present research. The present study clearly shows that the proposed non-conventional reinforcement arrangements improve to a significant degree the mechanical behaviour of pile caps and that strut-and-tie models comprises a safe and reliable analytical tool towards a rational design of these structural elements. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{classical}} shear {{analysis of}} Ritter and Mörsch explains the shear {{behavior in the}} cracked state by a truss analogy, using a truss with parallel chords with 45 ° <b>inclined</b> concrete <b>struts</b> and no stresses across the cracks. In this model the bending moment is carried by the top chord (concrete compression zone) and the bottom chord (main longitudinal reinforcement), and the applied shear force is fully carried by the web by means of inclined compressive stresses in the concrete and tension in the stirrups. This simplified version of truss model has long {{provided the basis for}} the formulation of general shear design codes, such as in ACI- 318 (1999) and Eurocode- 2 (Commission of the European Communities 1991). During last four decades, the concept of the truss model theory has been greatly extended, and now several approaches have been developed (Marti 1985; Nielsen 1984; Vecchio and Collins 1986; Schlaich et al. 1987; Ramirez and Breen 1991). An excellent review of the current theories as well as available experimental evidences are given by ASCE-ACI Committee (ASCE-ACI Committee 445; ASCE-ACI Committee 426).|$|R

40|$|A new Trapped Vortex Combustor (TVC) {{concept has}} been studied for {{applications}} {{such as those in}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as it offers potential for superior flame stability and low pressure loss. Flame stability is ensured by a strong vortex in a physical cavity attached to the combustor wall, and low pressure loss is due to the absence of swirl. Earlier studies on a compact combustor concept showed that there are issues with ensuring stable combustion over a range of operating conditions. The present work focuses on experimental studies and numerical simulations to study the stability issues and performance optimization in this compact single-cavity TVC configuration. For performing numerical simulations, an accurate and yet computationally affordable Modified Eddy Dissipation Concept combustion model is built upon the KIVA- 3 V platform to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions. Detailed validation with a turbulent non-premixed CH 4 /H 2 /N 2 flame from literature showed that the model is sufficiently accurate and the effect of various simulation strategies is assessed. Transient flame simulation capabilities are assessed by comparison with experimental data from an acoustically excited oscillatory H 2 -air diffusion flame reported in literature. Subsequent to successful validation of the model, studies on basic TVC flow oscillations are performed. Frequencies of flow oscillations are found to be independent of flow velocities and cavity length, but dependent on the cavity depth. Cavity injection and combustion individually affect the magnitude of flow oscillations but do not significantly alter the resonant frequencies. Reacting flow experiments and flow visualization studies in an existing experimental TVC rig with optical access and variable cavity L/D ratio show that TVC flame stability depends strongly on the cavity air velocity. A detailed set of numerical simulations also confirms this and helps to identify three basic modes of TVC flame stabilization. A clockwise cavity vortex stabilized flame is formed at low cavity air velocities relative to the mainstream, while a strong anticlockwise cavity vortex is formed at high cavity air velocities and low L/Ds. At intermediate conditions, the cavity vortex structure is found to be in a transition state which leads to large scale flame instabilities and flame blow-out. For solving the flame instability problem, a novel strategy of incorporating a flow guide vane is proposed to establish the advantageous anticlockwise vortex without the use of cavity air. Experimental results with the modified configuration are quite encouraging for TVC flame stability at laboratory conditions, while numerical results show good stability even at extreme operating conditions. Further design optimization studies are performed in a multi-parameter space using detailed simulations. From the results, a strategy of using <b>inclined</b> <b>struts</b> in the main flow path along with the ﬂow guide vane seems most promising. This configuration is tested experimentally and results pertaining to pressure drop, pattern factor and flame stability are found to be satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|The upper Campanian of the American Southwest has {{produced}} dinosaurs that are unknown {{from the northern}} Great Plains and vice versa. This {{has led to the}} idea that North America's Campanian dinosaur fauna was characterized by high levels of endemism and distinct faunal provinces. Here, two horned dinosaurs known from the Southwest, Pentaceratops and Kosmoceratops, are described from southern Canada. Pentaceratops aquilonius sp. nov. is represented by two frill fragments from the uppermost Dinosaur Park Formation near Manyberries, southeast Alberta. Features shared with Pentaceratops include large, triangular epiparietals, an M-shaped parietal posterior bar, and an epiparietal P 1 that curls up and twists laterally. The Manyberries specimens differ from Pentaceratops sternbergii and Utahceratops gettyi in that the posterior bar is broader, emargination is weakly developed, and P 1 is directed dorsally, rather than anteriorly. Phylogenetic analysis places P. aquilonius as sister to a clade comprising P. sternbergii and Utahceratops. Kosmoceratops is documented by a partial skull from Dinosaur Provincial Park. Previously referred to Chasmosaurus, the skull exhibits derived features inconsistent with this referral, including a reduced septal flange, a caudally <b>inclined</b> narial <b>strut,</b> a triangular narial process, a reduced frontal fontanelle, a weakly hooked rostral, and a narrow, caudally inclined internal naris.

The presence of Pentaceratops and Kosmoceratops in Canada argues against the idea of distinct northern and southern faunal provinces, but the fact that they differ from their southern relatives confirms that endemism was high in the Campanian. The ability of dinosaur lineages to disperse long distances across North America suggests that dinosaur distribution was not constrained by geographic barriers, climate, or flora. Instead, dinosaur endemism may result from competitive exclusion of immigrants by established populations adapted to local environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical {{research was conducted}} to investigate behaviour of low-rise concrete shear walls under simulated seismic loading. The experimental part of the research program includes tests of two large-scale shear wall specimens under inelastic load reversals. The walls were 1500 mm high and 100 mm thick, and had either 2000 mm or 1500 mm lengths, producing aspect ratios of 0. 75 and 1. 0. The effect of aspect ratio on shear sliding and failure modes {{was one of the}} major test parameters. The results indicated that both walls were able to develop flexural yielding and failed in crushing of diagonal struts. Little or no strength decay was observed up to approximately 0. 92 % and 1. 83 % lateral drift in walls with aspect ratios of 0. 75 and 1. 0, respectively. Shear sliding was limited to approximately 10 % of total lateral displacement, prior to the onset of strength degradation, indicating no premature failure caused by this mechanism. The deformation components indicate that flexure and shear were equally important in these walls, and formed approximately 80 % of total lateral displacement. A new analysis procedure was developed as part of the analytical investigation. The procedure can be used for strength and deformation computations for low-rise shear walls with aspect ratios of 1. 0 or less. It is based on equilibrium, compatibility, and material models. Potential failure planes are first identified and analyses of wall sections are carried out. One of the potential failure planes is the horizontal wall section at the base, and is critical against flexure. A standard plane section analysis is conducted at this section. The compression region determined from the plane section analysis is used to establish the second failure plane, which is inclined towards the loading corner. An inclined section analysis is conducted along this section based on experimentally observed strain variation. Diagonal compression in <b>inclined</b> concrete <b>strut</b> is checked against crushing. The strain condition computed from the inclined section analysis provide sufficient information to establish shear force-shear deformation relationship. The analysis procedure has been verified extensively against available test data. The analytical approach was simplified for use in design. A design procedure is recommended for low-rise shear walls with aspect ratios of 1. 0 or less...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{classical}} truss model (or strut-and-tie model) for {{shear failure}} of reinforced concrete beams {{is modified to}} describe fracture phenomena during failure. The failure {{is assumed to be}} caused by propagation of a compression fracture across the concrete strut during the portion of the loading history in which the maximum load is reached. The compression fracture may consist of a band of splitting cracks that later inter-connect to form a shear crack or a shear fracture band <b>inclined</b> to the <b>strut.</b> The width of the fracture band is assumed to occupy only a portion of the strut length and to represent a fixed material property independent of the beam depth. The energy release from the truss is calculated using two alternative approximate methods: (1) using the potential energy change deduced from the concept of stress relief zones; and (2) using the comple-mentary energy change due to stress redistribution caused by propagation of the fracture band across the com-pressed concrete strut. Both approaches show that a size effect on the nominal strength of shear failure must exist and that it should approximately follow the size effect law proposed by BaZant in 1984. The physical mechanism of the size effect is also explained in a clear and simple intuitive manner. Finally, it is shown that the applied nominal shear stress that causes large initial diagonal cracks to form also exhibits a size effect...|$|R
40|$|The present {{design rules}} for the shear {{capacity}} of members without shear reinforcement in Eurocode 2 were calibrated based on a database containing the experimental results of shear tests on simply supported beams. In practical dimensioning, these rules are also applied on the shear design of members with various other support conditions and on one-way slabs under concentrated loads, for instance wheel loads on bridge deck slabs. For this purpose, the slab-bearing behaviour is taken into account by an effective width for shear or assuming a load spreading. While the existing approaches for the effective width for shear are for most cases highly conservative, the assumption of a load spreading may lead to an unsafe design especially for large load distances from the support. Alternatively, the distribution of shear forces may be determined by linear-elastic finite-element simulations. However, the numerical results may significantly {{vary depending on the}} chosen support conditions and modelling settings. In order to develop more appropriate design approaches for the shear design of one-way slabs under concentrated loads, systematic experimental and theoretical investigations on the effective width for shear have been conducted. The experimental programme consisted of shear tests on 0. 28 m thick reinforced concrete slabs with a width varying between 0. 5 m and 3. 5 m. While the 0. 5 m wide slab strips were activated over their full width to carry the load, the effective widths of the 3. 5 m wide slabs were unattached of the load distance from the support with a small number of exceptions with 2 to 3 m smaller than the existing width. To investigate further influences on the effective width, numerous parametric studies have been conducted by non-linear and linear-elastic finite-element simulations and a database comprising 560 shear tests on one-way slabs and slab strips has been evaluated. The findings were used to develop a practicable approach for the effective width for shear. Furthermore, different loading and support conditions have been investigated. In order to account for the larger shear capacity of continuous members with small load distances from the support, the load reduction factor was modified considering the point of zero moment. Moreover, the influence of an <b>inclined</b> compression <b>strut</b> on the shear capacity in haunched members without shear reinforcement was quantified. The results of the own approaches in combination with existing design concepts for the shear capacity adequately coincide with the experimental data of the own tests and further tests from literature collected and prepared in shear databases. The new approaches ensure both an appropriate assessment of existing bridge deck slabs as well as a safe and economic shear design of new structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{reliability}} of structures {{is influenced by the}} uncertainties of actions and resistances. The random character of the structural variables can be considered via probabilistic approaches and the failure probability can be calculated as a measure for safety. The concept of limit states allows the deduction of the partial safety factors considering the random character of actions and resistances. The main methods of structural reliability analyses are presented and applied to determine the safety of punching design equations for footings. Around the columns large moments and vertical shear forces arise in the footings. These forces can cause a local shear failure, which is called punching shear failure. In general, design codes do not distinguish between the punching shear strength of flat slabs and footings. Although experimental investigations clearly indicate that the shear span-depth ratio significantly affects the punching shear behaviour of footings, this effect is not considered in most design codes. A test data bank was established and different design provisions were critically reviewed. In addition, probabilistic methods were used to thoroughly investigate the existing safety level. A total of 22 reinforced concrete footings were tested to investigate the punching shear behaviour of footings. Ten specimens were realistically supported on sand in cooperation with the Institute of Geotechnical Engineering. Whereas the remaining footings were supported on the column stub and a uniform surface load was applied. The present tests indicated that the shear span-depth ratio significantly affects the punching shear behaviour. The angle of the failure shear crack is steeper in punching tests on compact footings than observed in tests on more slender footings. The shear strength decreases with increasing shear span-depth ratio. Shear reinforcement can substantially increase the punching capacity of footings. However, it is less effective with decreasing shear span-depth ratio. Nonlinear numerical analyses were conducted to study the main parameters affecting the punching shear strength of footings systematically. In the simulations, different failure modes were observed. The load-bearing behaviour of the compact footings can be described by a strut and tie model. The compression <b>struts</b> are <b>inclined</b> and expand like a conical shell from the edges of the column towards the bottom of the footing. Hence, the punching cone primarily develops due to splitting failure of the <b>inclined</b> compression <b>struts.</b> In more slender footings the ultimate load is achieved when the highly stressed compression zone at the column faces crushes. Based on the experimental and numerical investigations, the model according to AN-DRÄ was adapted to footings without shear reinforcement. For footings without shear reinforcement, the empirical design rule of Eurocode 2 was modified with a factor taking into account the shear slenderness. The reliability of the final equation was verified via semi-probabilistic calculations. In addition, a design proposal for footings with shear reinforcement was derived. For eccentrically loaded footings with and without shear reinforcement, the proposed design equations can be combined with a sector model...|$|R
