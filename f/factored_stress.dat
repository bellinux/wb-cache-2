A self-completed questionnaire survey was conducted in 212 male Japanese workers at a synthetic fiber plant. With regard to insomnia, subjects were asked the first 5 of the 8 questions on the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Job <b>stress</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>stress</b> response and social support were assessed using the Job Stress Questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses showed that psychological job <b>stress</b> <b>factors</b> of poor appropriateness of work and high qualitative workload were associated with insomnia. The psychological stress response of depression and physical stress responses were also related with insomnia. Depression was also related to appropriateness of work. The present results showed that insomnia was closely related with the psychological job <b>stress</b> <b>factor</b> of appropriateness of work and the psychological response of depression. These mutual relationships between insomnia and poor mental health need be investigated further. Key words...|$|R
