Highlights include a triple conjunction of Jupiter, called the king planet, with the <b>fixed</b> <b>star</b> Regulus, called the king star, starting in September 3 BC. Larson believes that may be the time of Jesus' conception.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a <b>fixed</b> <b>star.</b> On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
25|$|From {{the tables}} of {{stars on the}} ceiling of the tombs of Rameses VI and Rameses IX it seems that for fixing the hours of the night a man seated on the ground faced the Astrologer in such a {{position}} that the line of observation of the pole star passed over the middle of his head. On the different days of the year each hour was determined by a <b>fixed</b> <b>star</b> culminating or nearly culminating in it, and the position of these stars at the time is given in the tables as in the centre, on the left eye, on the right shoulder, etc. According to the texts, in founding or rebuilding temples the north axis was determined by the same apparatus, and we may conclude that it was the usual one for astronomical observations. In careful hands it might give results of a high degree of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> (stellae fixae) is the {{background}} of astronomical objects that {{do not appear to}} move relative {{to each other in the}} night sky compared to the foreground of Solar System objects that do. Generally, the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> are taken to include all stars other than the Sun. Nebulae and other star-like objects may also be counted among the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Newton's {{time the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> were invoked as a {{reference}} frame supposedly at rest relative to absolute space. In other reference frames either at rest {{with respect to the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> or in uniform translation relative to these stars, Newton's laws of motion were supposed to hold. In contrast, in frames accelerating with respect to the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars,</b> in particular frames rotating relative to the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars,</b> the laws of motion did not hold in their simplest form, but had to be supplemented by the addition of fictitious forces, for example, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force.|$|R
50|$|As we now know, the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> are not <b>fixed.</b> The {{concept of}} {{inertial}} {{frames of reference}} is no longer tied to either the <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame {{is based upon the}} simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame, in particular, the absence of fictitious forces.Law of inertia holds for Galilean coordinate system which is a hypothetical system relative to which <b>fixed</b> <b>stars</b> remain <b>fixed.</b>|$|R
25|$|Though {{there is}} still-controversial {{evidence}} that Aristarchus of Samos possessed distinct {{values for the}} sidereal and tropical years as early as c. 280 BC, the discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus (190–120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy's Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis (320–260 BC) and Aristillus (~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun {{to return to a}}n equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a <b>fixed</b> <b>star),</b> and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving ("precessing") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than 36000 years.|$|E
25|$|In every lens there is, {{corresponding}} {{to a given}} apertal ratio (that is, {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a 1/4 in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a <b>fixed</b> <b>star,</b> for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' have not come into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.|$|E

As Mrgavyadha, the star represents Rudra (Shiva). [...] The star is referred as Makarajyoti in Malayalam and has religious significance to the pilgrim center Sabarimala. In Scandinavia, the star has been known as Lokabrenna ("burning done by Loki", or [...] "Loki's torch").

500|$|The most {{important}} cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes. The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs.

But three years later, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote [...] "If there is any <b>fixed</b> <b>star</b> in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."

500|$|Some of the {{earliest}} recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a <b>fixed</b> <b>star</b> when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, {{the motion of the}} planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the [...] "star" [...] he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.|$|E

2500|$|The Court held, in a 6-to-3 {{decision}} {{delivered by}} Justice Jackson, {{that it was}} unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag.

2500|$|Galileo's {{drawings}} {{show that}} he observed Neptune on December 28, 1612, and again on January 27, 1613; on both occasions, Galileo mistook Neptune for a <b>fixed</b> <b>star</b> when it appeared very close (in conjunction) to Jupiter in the night sky. Historically {{it was thought that}} he believed it to be a fixed blue star, and so he is not credited with its discovery. At the time of his first observation in December 1612, it was stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that very day; because it was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, Neptune's motion was thought to be too slight, and its apparent size too small, to clearly appear to be a planet in Galileo's small telescope. However, in July 2009 University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was indeed aware that he had discovered something unusual about this [...] "star". Galileo, in one of his notebooks, noted the movement of a background star (Neptune) on January 28 and a dot (in Neptune's position) drawn in a different ink suggests that he found it on an earlier sketch, drawn on the night of January 6, suggesting a systematic search among his earlier observations. However, so far there is neither clear evidence that he identified this moving object as a planet, nor that he published these observations of it. There is no evidence that he ever attempted to observe it again.|$|E
