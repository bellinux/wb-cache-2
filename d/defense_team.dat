5|$|As {{the crime}} {{involved}} {{more than one}} victim, the prosecutors decided to request the death penalty when the case went to trial.

5|$|After the hearing, Jones {{allegedly}} spat in {{the face}} of his son's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, and supposedly pushed her to the floor.

5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should never have been charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal <b>defense</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blythe also {{alleged that}} after {{learning}} about Nosek's death, {{he had written}} {{a letter to the}} Nosek family, in which he offered help and a meeting in-person.

5|$|He {{was taken}} to Frankfort and tried before an {{examining}} court, but Commonwealth's Attorney Charles S. Bibb {{said that he had}} not yet collected enough evidence to detain him.

5|$|In September 2006, Thompson brought another $600 million {{lawsuit against}} Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony Computer Entertainment. The lawsuit claimed that 14-year-old Posey {{played the game}} obsessively before murdering his father, stepmother, and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo, New Mexico. Posey's <b>defense</b> <b>team</b> argued that he was abused by his father and was taking Zoloft {{at the time of}} the killings. The suit alleged that the murders would not have taken place if Posey had not obsessively played Vice City. The case was {{dismissed}} in December 2007, as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take-Two.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, four {{government}} witnesses testified.

5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's <b>defense</b> <b>team</b> was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers.

5|$|On April 13, the <b>defense</b> <b>team</b> {{notified}} Paul Morrison that Green {{wished to}} plea bargain. On April 17 the plea {{was made public}} when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years {{without the possibility of}} parole. Green denied being under the influence of any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1848 {{division}} of land known as the Great Māhele, {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and acreage to allow private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal <b>defense</b> <b>team</b> in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of his father to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and <b>defense</b> <b>team,</b> on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E

5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's <b>defense</b> <b>team.</b> The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a <b>defense</b> <b>team</b> of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
