[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' We {{wanted to make a}} record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [cheerfully]. Why not, pettikins? Very few {{young women}} can resist Hector. I couldn't when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> He is really rather splendid, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I myself am fond of money," [...] Phineas Duge answered, smiling, [...] "but I {{think that}} if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> <b>I</b> should feel very much the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk in that way, child, for heaven's sake! you do read such books--they {{give you}} such ideas of everything. I declare when <b>your</b> aunt and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> we {{knew nothing about}} wickedness. <b>I</b> think it <b>was</b> better so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very ingeniously put, young gentleman, {{and quite}} plausible. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> four years without once seeing either father or mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{returned}} John, 'one and sixpence. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I {{had never}} seen so much money, in a heap. A shilling of it is in case of accidents--the mare casting a shoe, or the like of that. The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London; and the diversion I recommend {{is going to the}} top of the Monument, and sitting there. There's no temptation there, sir--no drink--no young women--no bad characters of any sort--nothing but imagination. That's the way I enjoyed myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheer up! You {{will break}} your neck yet! When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I {{remember}} feeling it deeply that I {{was not allowed}} to risk the lives of others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> young man," [...] he said ruefully, as he rose. [...] "I'd {{knock the}} heads o' these young scamps t'gether,--yessir!--I could do it, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that he has deserted us?" [...] she cried. [...] "That he has left us here defenceless,--at {{the mercy of the}} Dutch, that they may wreak their vengeance upon us women? How can you sit still, Virginia? If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> and able to drag myself to the street, <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> at the Arsenal now. <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even if he is a Yankee." [...] Virginia kept her temper.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a {{young fellow}} yet, an' you've time, {{if you only}} take kindly to learnin'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> past <b>your</b> <b>age</b> when <b>I</b> learned most I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are young}} enough {{to respond to the}} appeals that {{sometimes}} find me silent. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> of <b>your</b> <b>age</b> <b>I</b> should certainly investigate some of these interesting problems." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The proper time's no time, sir,' {{repeated}} John Willet; 'when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I never talked, I {{never wanted}} to talk. I listened and improved myself that's what I did.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be something," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Oakley. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I {{had taught}} myself bookkeeping, shorthand, and typewriting. What can you do? Can {{you use a}} typewriter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{that another}} sort of joke?" [...] asked the old man. [...] "You've no excuse for being bored anywhere. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I {{had never heard of}} such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can guess}} it, my boy; for I, too, lost my father when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> God's ways <b>are</b> not our ways, Ned; and be sure, {{although}} {{you may not}} see it now, that he acts for the best." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir ANTHONY Why, you unfeeling, insensible puppy, I despise you! When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> such a {{description}} {{would have made}} me fly like a rocket! The aunt indeed! Odds life! when I ran away with your mother, I would not have touched anything old or ugly to gain an empire.|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear on that account, Pathfinder. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> near <b>your</b> <b>age</b> before <b>I</b> prevailed on {{the mind}} of her mother; and Mabel is a steady, {{thoughtful}} girl, one that will regard character more than anything else. A lad like Jasper Eau-douce, for instance, will have no chance with her, though he is both young and comely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] said Chatterton. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I {{never allowed}} such trifles to daunt me. You surely {{did not expect}} her to say she had been patiently waiting for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mother, don't pamper him,' {{he called}} after her. 'Michael, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I took {{medicine}} without a murmur. I said [...] "Thank you, kind parents, {{for giving me}} bottles to make me well."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said as much. I {{felt very}} much the same way when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> And you like our prospects?... Well, you've thought things out. Neale, the {{building}} of the U. P. will be hell!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Four years, perhaps," [...] {{returned}} Nasmyth, with a {{trace of}} grimness. [...] "That is, in one sense. In another, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> double <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> You see, you have never been brought {{into contact with the}} realities of life. If you had been, you would probably not be so ready to take me for what you think <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> as <b>I</b> believe you have graciously done. After all, you know so very little about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mon Dieu, que vous dirai-je? Of course you're rough; but so <b>was</b> <b>I</b> at <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> And if {{you find}} your voice it may carry you far. Besides, {{what does it matter}} what I think? How can I judge for your English public?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sure you}} would. You {{are just the}} same sort of fellow <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when at <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much happier after <b>I</b> <b>was</b> married, so <b>I</b> know it. Now, you see, your cousin has a hundred {{thousand}} pounds; in fact something more than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, don't pamper him," [...] {{he called}} after her. [...] "Michael, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I took {{medicine}} without a murmur. I said, 'Thank you, kind parents, {{for giving me}} bottles to make me well.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] said Val suddenly; [...] "but things aren't {{what they}} were when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> There's a 'Tomorrow we die' feeling. That's what old George meant about my uncle Soames. HE doesn't mean to die tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{has that}} got to do with it, sir? I vum, sir, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I could make a fire of green red-oak; yessir! Don't talk to me of colds! Stir your stumps and get warm, sir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If Youth but knew!' he sighed. 'Young man, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{nearly twice}} <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> and I have, at a modest estimate, about {{ten times as}} much sense. Yet, in your overweening self-confidence, with your ungovernable gall, you fancy you can hand me a lemon. Me! I should smile!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{my desire}} to make this {{military}} academy {{one of the best}} in the country," [...] declared the colonel earnestly. [...] "And I cannot do that without the sincere coöperation of every cadet attending the institution. As many of you know"--and here he glanced at Jack and Fred--"when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about <b>your</b> <b>age</b> <b>I</b> attended Putnam Hall Military Academy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure the training I received there did me much good, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also sure that I made many friends who will stand by me as long as I live.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, Allan. Yet the Book {{tells us}} to turn the other cheek and to forget injuries. Still, {{it is for you}} to judge, remembering that we must answer for all things at the last day, and not for me. I only know that <b>were</b> <b>I</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> and not {{burdened}} with a daughter to watch over, I should go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I daresay you haven't {{had much}} practice,' said the Queen. 'When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I always {{did it for}} half-an-hour a day. Why, {{sometimes}} I've believed {{as many as six}} impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] she replied. [...] "All {{young people}} boast of their health. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> every thought of illness was {{as black as}} a visitation of the devil. That's the door where we must lay all such evils, isn't it, Mr Pellew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|PEW. That's my way. That's Pew's way, that is. That's Pew's way all over. Commander, {{excuse the}} liberty; but when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> making {{allowance}} for a lowlier station and less 'ed for argyment, I was as like you as two peas. I know {{it by the}} v'ice. (Sings)-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Dolores stood abashed, but a grey alpaca, {{which she}} had always much disliked, came out next, and Mrs. Halfpenny decided that with her black ribbons that would do, though {{it turned out to}} be rather shockingly short, and to show a great display of black legs; but as the box {{containing}} the clothes in present wear had not come to hand, this must stand for the present--and besides, a voice was heard, saying, 'Is Dora ready?' and a young person darted up, put her arms round her neck, and kissed her before she knew what she was about. 'Mamma said I should come because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> thirteen and a half,' she said. 'I'm Mysie, though my proper name is Maria Millicent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, my dear, that is {{on account}} of your youth and inexperience--but you will learn better in time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just so, myself, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> and thought the fore-rafters were as {{handsome}} as the squared-jiggers, but soon after I married Capt. Budd I felt the necessity of knowing more than I did about ships, and I got him to teach me. He {{did n't like the}} business, at first, and pretended I would never learn; but, at last, it came all at once like, and then he used to be delighted to hear me `talk ship,' as he called it. I've known him laugh, with his cronies, as if ready to die, at my expertness in sea-terms, for half an hour together--and then he would swear--that was the worst fault your uncle had, Rosy--he would swear, sometimes, in a way that frightened me, I do declare!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Choose the d--l!" [...] {{answered}} my father, hastily, and then checking himself--"I profess {{you make me}} as great a fool as you <b>are</b> yourself. <b>Is</b> he not enough to drive one mad, Owen?"--Poor Owen shook his head, and looked down. [...] "Hark ye, Frank," [...] continued my father, [...] "I will cut all this matter very short. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at <b>your</b> <b>age</b> when my father turned me out of doors, and settled my legal inheritance on my younger brother. I left Osbaldistone Hall {{on the back of}} a broken-down hunter, with ten guineas in my purse. I have never crossed the threshold again, and I never will. I know not, and I care not, if my fox-hunting brother is alive, or has broken his neck; but he has children, Frank, and one of them shall be my son if you cross me farther in this matter." ...|$|R
