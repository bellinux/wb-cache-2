5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members who were killed in the Holocaust. Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> their Torah scrolls. After the war the scrolls were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1885, {{one week}} after the massacre, six {{companies}} of soldiers arrived in Wyoming. Four of the six companies then escorted the Chinese back to Rock Springs. Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood. The mining company <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.|$|E
5|$|Outwardly, the {{destruction}} and removals for sale {{had changed the}} church forever. Many churches had concealed their vestments and their silver, and <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> their stone altars. There were many disputes {{between the government and}} parishes over church property. Thus, when Edward died in July 1553 and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to have the Protestant Lady Jane Grey made Queen, the unpopularity of the confiscations gave Mary the opportunity to have herself proclaimed Queen, first in Suffolk, and then in London to the acclamation of the crowds.|$|E

In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, 2008, {{rumors of}} a {{construction}} worker burying a Red Sox jersey in the concrete of the new Yankee Stadium were verified after anonymous tips led {{to the location of}} the jersey. The worker, identified as Gino Castignoli, <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> a David Ortiz jersey in what would become a service corridor in the hopes of cursing the new stadium. After extracting the jersey from underneath two feet of concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox. Whatever curse was intended failed to bear fruit with the Yankees winning the World Series in their first year at the new stadium.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day (26 February), police began excavating {{the section of}} the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> his daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human thigh bone protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating {{the section of the}} garden where Fred had indicated he <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> his daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, although one kneecap and several phalange bones were missing, and her fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via dental records as being that of Heather West.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Chinese historiography {{almost always}} portrayed the First Emperor of the Chinese unified {{states as a}} brutal tyrant who had an obsessive fear of assassination. Ideological {{antipathy}} towards the Legalist State of Qin was established as early as 266 BC, when Confucian philosopher Xunzi disparaged it. Later Confucian historians condemned the emperor who had burned the classics and <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> Confucian scholars alive.

Ackerman had previously played club rugby in Canberra not long before the Barbarians game, and according to Mark Ella in his book, Running Rugby, the two men did not get along with each other. After the Wallabies 1984 win against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, Campese claimed Ackerman <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> {{his head in the}} dirt during the game, adding to a sense of tension between the two.|$|E
25|$|Essie then {{brings a}} letter to Grandpa that's from the {{government}}. Grandpa had lied to the government {{that he was actually}} Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is confirmed because the family <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> the deceased milkman who had lived with them prior to De Pinna under Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now owe him a refund, instead of him owing them taxes.|$|E

Within the same six months, the queen had even been taken as war booty and had had to bind the shoes of a queen who beat her and abused her.

He later led investigators to the bodies of two other victims he had confessed to killing. Three of the 56 victims Chikatilo confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but Chikatilo was charged with killing 53 women and children between 1978 and 1990. He was held in the same cell in Rostov-on-Don where he had been detained on 20 November, to await trial.|$|E
25|$|Questioned further {{as to his}} claims, Fred calmly {{explained}} {{there were}} a further five bodies buried in his cellar, and a sixth body beneath the ground-floor bathroom. Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls he had picked up at bus stops whom he had murdered in the 1970s. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, {{and that he had}} transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The actual dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubicle graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate precisely where he <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> each victim.|$|E
25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in September 1939, Cartier-Bresson joined the French Army as a Corporal in the Film and Photo unit. During the Battle of France, in June 1940 at St. Dié in the Vosges Mountains, he was {{captured}} by German soldiers and spent 35 months in prisoner-of-war camps doing forced labor under the Nazis. He twice {{tried and failed to}} escape from the prison camp, and was punished by solitary confinement. His third escape was successful and he hid on a farm in Touraine before getting false papers that allowed him to travel in France. In France, he worked for the underground, aiding other escapees and working secretly with other photographers to cover the Occupation and then the Liberation of France. In 1943, he dug up his beloved Leica camera, which he <b>had</b> <b>buried</b> in farmland near Vosges. At {{the end of the war}} he was asked by the American Office of War Information to make a documentary, Le Retour (The Return) about returning French prisoners and displaced persons.|$|E
50|$|In reality, pirates burying {{treasure}} was rare: {{the only}} pirate known to <b>have</b> <b>buried</b> treasure was William Kidd, who {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>buried</b> {{at least some of}} his wealth on Long Island before sailing into New York City. Kidd had originally been commissioned as a privateer for England, but his behavior had strayed into outright piracy, and he hoped that his treasure could serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations to avoid punishment.
