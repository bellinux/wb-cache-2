5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been <b>inferred</b> to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been <b>inferred</b> to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been <b>inferred</b> to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have had similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have had similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E

40|$|Social {{networks}} contain implicit {{knowledge that}} can be used to <b>infer</b> hierarchical relations that are not explicitly present in the available data. Interaction patterns are typically affected by users' social relations. We present an approach to <b>inferring</b> such information that applies a link-analysis ranking algorithm at different levels of time granularity. In addition, a voting scheme is employed for obtaining the hierarchical relations. The approach is evaluated on two datasets: the Enron email data set, where the goal is to <b>infer</b> manager-subordinate relationships, and the Co-author data set, where the goal is to <b>infer</b> PhD advisor-advisee relations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms more traditional approaches to <b>inferring</b> hierarchical relations from social networks...|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the <b>inferred</b> evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{practices}} were noted during the Periods I and II and crops grown were <b>inferred</b> as wheat, barley and lentil; finding lentils established a link of the Neolithic people with Central Asia, crossing over the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Dating of the Sumtseg {{has been}} {{made on the basis}} of the names of the priests inscribed on the top floor of the structure. The last name inscribed is that of the Drigungpa school of Drigungpa or Jigten Gonpo (1143–1217) from which it is <b>inferred</b> that Sumsteg was {{established}} in the early 13th century.|$|E
50|$|Lacking {{trustworthy}} explicit {{information about}} such viewpoints, {{this type of}} social network search engine mines the web to <b>infer</b> the topology of online social networks.

5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be <b>inferred</b> when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred {{several times during}} evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago. An eruption {{during the late}} Glacial formed the MENo tephra. The volcanic activity has been <b>inferred</b> from tephra layers in lakes and outcrops.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet. Such polarization {{is the result}} of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends {{on the nature of the}} grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than <b>inferred</b> in any other comet.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, a {{magnetic}} field around HD 209458 b was <b>inferred</b> from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of {{a magnetic}} field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field {{is estimated to be}} about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to stories {{of gender and}} sexual variance that are generally accepted by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and queer activists have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or <b>inferred</b> them from stories that traditionally are considered to have no homoerotic subtext. Such analyses have caused disagreements about {{the true meaning of}} the ancient stories.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{stars in}} Perseus {{have been found}} to have {{planetary}} systems. V718 Persei is a star in the young open cluster IC 348 that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we analyse {{a problem of}} <b>inferring</b> a grammar jrom a given sample of a language. We try to present an {{algebraic}} formalism capable of describing the issue. We consider two cases: a case of <b>inferring</b> canonical finite-state grammars, and a case of <b>inferring</b> general grammars. In both cases we define a semigroup structure. Finally {{we look at the}} possibility of getting a structure of a group...|$|R

5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} blocks continued even after their collision, generating strike-slip faults. The Saravan fault east of Taftan is one such fault; the 2013 Saravan earthquake occurred on this fault. From some of these faults it has been <b>inferred</b> that the mass load from the Taftan edifice has measurable effects on tectonic stress within the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} <b>inferred</b> {{the position}} of the South Magnetic Pole, and made substantial observations of the zoology and botany of the region, resulting in a monograph on the zoology, and a series of four detailed monographs by Hooker on the botany, collectively called Flora Antarctica and published in parts between 1843 and 1859. The expedition was the last major voyage of exploration made wholly under sail.|$|E
5000|$|Energy-level - Unlike {{emission}} as a {{basis for}} inference, energy-level (response magnitude) provides a basis for <b>inferring</b> the response has a strength with a high range of varying strength. Energy level is a basis from which we can <b>infer</b> a high tendency to respond. An energetic and strong [...] "Chomsky!" [...] forms the basis for <b>inferring</b> the strength of the response as opposed to a weak, brief [...] "Chomsky".|$|R
40|$|Cells {{must respond}} to {{environmental}} changes to remain viable, yet {{the information they}} receive is often noisy. Through a biochemical implementation of Bayes's rule, we show that genetic networks can act as inference modules, <b>inferring</b> from intracellular conditions the likely state of the extracellular environment and regulating gene expression appropriately. By considering a two-state environment, either poor or rich in nutrients, we show that promoter occupancy {{is proportional to the}} (posterior) probability of the high nutrient state given current intracellular information. We demonstrate that single-gene networks <b>inferring</b> and responding to a high environmental state <b>infer</b> best when negatively controlled, and those <b>inferring</b> and responding to a low environmental state <b>infer</b> best when positively controlled. Our interpretation is supported by experimental data from the lac operon and should provide a basis for both understanding more complex cellular decision-making and designing synthetic inference circuits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automatically <b>inferring</b> synchronization for concurrent programs. Given a program and a specification, we <b>infer</b> synchronization that avoids all interleavings violating the specification, but permits as many valid interleavings as possible. We let the user specify an upper bound {{on the cost of}} synchronization, which may limit the observability — what observations on program state can be made by the synchronization code. We present an algorithm that <b>infers,</b> under certain conditions, the maximally permissive synchronization for a given cost. We implemented a prototype of our approach and applied it to <b>infer</b> synchronization in a number of small programs. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{great auk}} was never {{observed}} and described by modern scientists during its existence, {{and is only}} known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct.

5|$|All {{of these}} treasures are later copies {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the Eiga Monogatari, the complete content of the works has to be assembled from several of these (and other) fragmentary manuscripts or be <b>inferred</b> from other sources. The Kojiki, long neglected by scholars until the 18th century, was not preserved as well as the Nihon Shoki which has been studied from soon after its compilation. While being the oldest text in this list, the extant manuscript dating to the 14th century is the earliest entry.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be <b>inferred</b> by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
40|$|Broca’s and Wernicke’s {{discovery}} concerning brain language function remains debatable. The research questions: a) Is there {{a significant}} difference of accuracy among the rh, the lh, and the rh-lh in <b>inferring</b> auditory sentences? b) Which hemisphere shows the highest accuracy? and c) Do the rh, lh and rh-lh show consistent hemispheric accuracy when <b>inferring</b> sentences and short dialogs? The research results are useful for clarifying controversies against brain language function and as a foundation of ”hemispheric-based listening”. This study employed Behavioral Test with Post-test Only design. Sample involved 120 students. Data were collected through a test and analyzed with Two-way Anova. It is found that the hemispheric accuracy among the rh, lh and rh-lh in <b>inferring</b> auditory sentences is significantly different; the lh shows the highest accuracy in <b>inferring</b> auditory sentences; and the rh, lh and rh-lh show inconsistent hemispheric accuracy when <b>inferring</b> sentences and short dialogs...|$|R
