40|$|<b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> {{and drying}} {{cabinets}} have {{to a large}} extent replaced the traditional way of drying clothes outdoors. They are faster, more convenient, require less space and can be operated regardless of weather conditions. This replacement has significantly increased residential energy consumption, {{due to the fact that}} <b>tumbles</b> <b>dryers</b> consume large amounts of electrical energy. In the USA 9 % of the households electric energy is consumed when drying clothes. Over 4 million <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are sold in Europe each year and 20 % of the residential electricity consumption in Sweden is used drying and washing clothes. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are also utilized in the industrial sector, but industrial dryers are not considered in this study. Increasing energy costs contributes to the public’s awareness and desire to cut their energy consumption. The aim of this study is to increase the energy efficiency and drastically reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers.</b> There are two main types of <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> available on the market; the open cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> and the closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> The open cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> is often attached to the ventilation system and thereby it evacuates its exhaust air. The closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> condenses the water from the air before it recirculates it. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers,</b> two separate studies were made. One on a water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> and one on a hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> Both <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> where rebuild and originated from the same <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> The <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> that both studies originated from was a conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> The <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> is made by Asko Cylinda AB. The results reveal that the water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> does not have greater energy efficiency than the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> However the drying time was reduced by 37 %. The result also reveals that the hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> cuts the electric consumption by 93 % and improves the energy efficiency by 53 % compared to the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> On the other hand the drying time increases by 9 %...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are {{becoming}} more and more common in ordinary households as a complement to the washing machine. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> offer a fast drying cycle independent on weather conditions and require small space. They do, however, considering the large number of units use a large amount of electricity. The main objective in this thesis is to identify possibilities in order to reach a reduced electricity use for domestic tumble-drying of clothes. This involves an investigation of the condensing <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> in order to point out possible energy efficiency improvements. The purpose of the energy label, which indicates the energy efficiency of the <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer,</b> is also studied, whether it matches the actual laundry habits. Finally, suggestions for technical development of the <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> are made in line with today’s consumer behaviour. The performance of the condensing <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> has been studied using a design of experiments to create a statistical model in Paper I. This model was used to find the best settings for the power supply to the heater, the internal airflow and the external airflow in order to reach a high specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) and a low leakage ratio. A low external airflow and high power supply to the heater gives the highest SMER. To reach the lowest values for the leakage ratio, a low internal airflow should be applied together with a high external airflow. The use of a statistical model gave valuable information of the performance of the existing <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> For further improving the energy efficiency of the dryer, the amount of leakage and its location was investigated in Paper IV. By studying energy and mass balances from experiments, pressure measurements and modelling, the effects of leakage on the process were evaluated. As the location of the leakage is so important for the energy efficiency, the worst-case scenario where leakage is located between the heater and the drum is used as a start point in the study. It was determined that there is a large leakage of air between the heater and the drum leading to a significant loss in energy recovery. The drying loads used by consumers are getting smaller, often less than 3 kg dry load, while the maximum capacity of the dryers are increasing, up to 7 or 8 kg. In Paper II, tests were made with different loads in order to investigate if the energy label serves its purpose as today’s standard is set at the dryers’ maximum capacity. The results from this study show that the energy efficiency when drying a small load is significantly lower than for a large load. In order to encourage a production of <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> with higher energy efficiency for small loads, where the dryer is most frequently used, the standards for the energy label should be revised. Today, manufacturers do not gain any benefits by improving the performance for partial loads. A mathematical model over a venting <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> was established in Paper III with the aim of testing different control strategies in order to improve the energy efficiency of the <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> for partial loads. The ideas behind the different strategies were to minimize the heat losses during the drying process and to increase the residence time for the air in the drum and thereby increase the moisture content of the air leaving the drum. Using such a control strategy it is possible to reach an improvement of SMER by approximately 4 % when drying small loads. In order to reach larger improvements, however, a more extensive product development will be necessary. Finally, the results in this thesis points at the necessity of including not only the technical development of the <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer,</b> but also the policy tools involved and the consumers’ habits in order to reach a reduced electricity use for drying clothes in households. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{textiles}} were dried outdoors {{with the}} wind and the sun enhancing the drying process. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> offer a fast and convenient way of drying textiles independent of weather conditions. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers,</b> however, consume large amounts of electrical energy. Over 4 million <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are sold each year in Europe and a considerable amount of energy is used for drying of clothes. Increasing energy costs and the awareness about environmental problems related to a large energy use has increased the demand for dryers with better energy efficiency. The aim with this thesis is to show how to improve the energy efficiency of domestic <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers.</b> Two types of <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are available on the market today: the open cycle dryer and the closed cycle dryer. In the open cycle dryer room air is heated and led into the drying drum. The exhaust air leaves the dryer and is often evacuated outside the building. In the closed cycle dryer an internal airflow is recirculated inside the dryer. When the hot air has passed through the drying drum it is led through a heat exchanger where the water vapour is condensed before the air is heated again and led to the drum. The heat exchanger is cooled with room air. Drying at low temperature has been shown to reduce the specific energy use for an open cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> In Paper I a correlation between the specific energy use, the drying time and the heat supply was established for a specific load by using the exhaust air temperature. It was shown that the total drying time and specific energy use could be predicted from data during the first hour of the process. This result indicated a possibility to create a control system that makes it possible for the user to choose between low energy use or short drying time. The focus of Paper II is to reduce the energy use for a closed cycle <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> Energy and mass balances were established in order to determine feasible improvements. Energy and mass flows in the dryer indicated that reducing leakage from the internal system of the dryer gave the largest reduction of specific energy use. Insulation of the back cover of the dryer and opening the internal system during the falling drying rate period also gave positive results on the energy use. In total a feasible reduction of the energy use of approximately 17 % was calculated...|$|R

40|$|One {{aspect of}} {{reducing}} the energy consumption of a household <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> {{is to reduce the}} pressure drop of the circulating air in the internal duct system. It is, however, costly and time consuming to design several prototypes for airflow measurements. In this paper, several fluid mechanic parameters in a partial model of the internal duct system of a <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> have been studied in the CFD software Comsol MultiPhysics. The purpose was to establish a numerically based design process, where the design is conducted based on visual analysis of air velocity and vorticity, and two design criteria. The geometry design was conducted by a CAD-engineer, which was the counterpart of this project. In order to enable a successful design process, it was essential to establish a strong relation between fluid parameters and design criteria in order to share knowledge effectively with the CAD-engineer. Two geometry modifications, based on a standard model, were conducted on the duct. Based on the design criteria, the pressure drop and the non-uniformity coefficient of the outlet airflow, the second modification (Modification 2) represents an improvement as the pressure drop is reduced by 23 % and the uniformity at the outflow section is increased by 3 %.

40|$|The Dutch {{residential}} sector {{has seen a}} large increase {{in the amount of}} installed solar capacity. However, solar power production is currently in mismatch with electricity demand from households. This imbalance can be addressed by large investments in storage technologies, but a more cost-friendly way would be Demand Side Management (DSM). DSM implies shifting demand from hours with high demand and low renewable production to hours with low demand and high renewable production. This research has focused on DSM with wet appliances: the washing machine, dishwasher and <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> Currently the washing machine is mainly used in the morning and afternoon. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryer</b> use is dependent on washing machine use and therefore displays the same usage profile a couple of hours later. <b>Tumble</b> <b>dryers</b> are mainly used in the evening, with clear peaks after dinnertime and around midnight. The two main applications of DSM analyzed in this research are evening peak reduction and increase in PV self-consumption. It was found that for both types the washing machine has the least potential, with a median average peak reduction of less than 25 watts per household and a median increase in PV self-consumption of 28 kWh per household per year. The dishwasher has the best potential of all three wet appliances, with median average peak reduction up to 35 watts per household, while PV self-consumption for the median household can be increased with 68 kWh per appliance. The <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer’s</b> potential is located between these two appliances, the median average peak reduction potential up to 30 watts per household on average and 38 kWh per year increase in PV self-consumption per appliance.

40|$|In {{heat pump}} <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers,</b> {{moisture}} separates from the laundry {{and leaves the}} dryer system at the evaporator. Moist air goes out the drum and enters the evaporator whose outer surface is below the dew point temperature. Air cools and then leaves its moisture.

Fin-and-tube heat exchangers are used as evaporators in household heat pump <b>tumble</b> <b>dryers.</b> In addition to optimum operating conditions, optimum evaporator geometry can significantly affect system performance. In this study, a model was developed for household heat pump <b>tumble</b> <b>dryer.</b> The model was validated by experimental data collected from the literature.

Then, coefficient of performance (COP), moisture extraction rate (MER), and specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) were calculated. As a result, the effects of fin spacing and tube outer diameter of evaporator were determined depending on the input characteristics of the dryer model.
