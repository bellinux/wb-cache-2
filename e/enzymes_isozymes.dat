40|$|Four cDNAs {{encoding}} phosphoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP) synthase {{were isolated}} from a spinach (Spinacia oleracea) cDNA library by complementation of an Escherichia coli Δprs mutation. The four gene products produced PRPP in vitro from ATP and ribose- 5 -phosphate. Two of the <b>enzymes</b> (<b>isozymes</b> 1 and 2) required inorganic phosphate for activity, whereas {{the others were}} phosphate independent. PRPP synthase isozymes 2 and 3 contained 76 and 87 amino acid extensions, respectively, at their N-terminal ends in comparison with other PRPP synthases. Isozyme 2 was synthesized in vitro and shown to be imported and processed by pea (Pisum sativum) chloroplasts. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that isozyme 3 may be transported to mitochondria and that isozyme 4 may {{be located in the}} cytosol. The deduced amino acid sequences of isozymes 1 and 2 and isozymes 3 and 4 were 88 % and 75 % identical, respectively. In contrast, the amino acid identities of PRPP synthase isozyme 1 or 2 with 3 or 4 was modest (22 %– 25 %), but the sequence motifs for binding of PRPP and divalent cation-nucleotide were identified in all four sequences.

Objective: In the present study, protein and isozyme profiles for peroxidase, esterase, acid phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase of five species of Memecylon (Melastomataceae), Memecylon umbellatum, Memecylon edule, Memecylon talbotianum, Memecylon malabaricum, and Memecylon wightii were investigated.

Separation of isozymes was carried out using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the banding patterns of protein were scored. Pair-wise comparisons of genotypes, based on {{the presence or absence}} of unique and shared polymorphic products, were used to regenerate similarity coefficients.

40|$|Enzyme electrophoretic {{analysis}} was used to test the hypothesis that hemlock woolly adelgid in the East are genetically uniform. Adelgids from infested eastern hemlock collected in Virginia, New Jersey, and Connecticut were screened at each of seven putative <b>enzyme</b> loci. The <b>isozyme</b> profiles for four of the enzymes were typical of homozygous and invariant loci for adelgids from the three sites. The remaining isozymes exhibited profiles expected of groups with heterozygous origin but the putative alleles for the adelgids were fixed across all three sites. This initial estimate of large-scale genetic diversity in hemlock woolly adelgid suggests that populations of this insect in the Eastern United States are genetically uniform. If eastern populations of adelgid actually have little or no genetic differentiation between them, the low variability could delay pesticide resistance or favor the breeding of resistant hemlock.

Variations are large for active-site regions, the segment around the second zinc atom, and for segments involved in subunit interactions. The two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase have diverged to exhibit structural differences to about half the extent of those between alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases. Hence, the two classes of alcohol dehydrogenase represent steps in <b>enzyme</b> rather than <b>isozyme</b> divergence. An evolutionary scheme that relates different types of zinc-containing mammalian dehydrogenases to one another encompasses at least three levels of gene duplication subsequent to the early step(s) of assembly of building unit(s). The first level of duplication results in the formation of now clearly different enzymes. The second level concerns the various classes of alcohol dehydrogenase, forming steps between typical <b>enzymes</b> and <b>isozymes.</b> The third level encompasses recent and multiple duplications in isozyme evolution of alcohol dehydrogenases. This scheme, linking zinc-containing dehydrogenases at different levels, resembles that in other protein families and reflects general patterns in protein relationships...|$|R

Two {{species of the}} <b>enzyme</b> (<b>isozymes</b> I and II) were separated by DE- 52 cellulose column chromatography from healthy, cut, and black-rot diseased tissues. Isozymes I and II were purified from healthy and diseased tissues, respectively. Reduction of pyruvate by NADH with either isozyme I or II was inhibited by pyruvate at high concentrations, by NAD + and by several mononucleotides. Isozyme I was inhibited by a lower concentration of adenine nucleotide than isozyme n, and Km for pyruvate was increased markedly at acidic pH {{in the case of}} isozyme I, but only slightly in the case of isozyme n. The molecular weights of both isozymes were determined to be 150, 000 and they were found to be charge isomers by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme activity increased in response to infection by black-rot fungus but decreased in response to cutting. Many papers on NAD-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from animals, fungi, and bacteria have been published. In contrast, few studies have appeared (i) on plant LDH, because alcohol is the main product of plants under anaerobic conditions. The nature of LDH isozymes and the role of each iso-zyme in carbohydrate metabolism have been studied only in animal tissues (2, 3).

40|$|The {{rates of}} {{formation}} of the two alternative products of acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) have been determined by a new analytical method (N. Gollop, Z. Barak, and D. M. Chipman, Anal. Biochem., 160 : 323 - 331, 1987). For {{each of the three}} distinct isozymes of AHAS in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, a specificity ratio, R, was defined: Formula: see text, which is constant over a wide range of substrate concentrations. This is consistent with competition between pyruvate and 2 -ketobutyrate for an active acetaldehyde intermediate formed irreversibly after addition of the first pyruvate moiety to the <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Isozyme</b> I showed no product preference (R = 1), whereas isozymes II and III form acetohydroxybutyrate (AHB) at approximately 180 - and 60 -fold faster rates, respectively, than acetolactate (AL) at equal pyruvate and 2 -ketobutyrate concentrations. R values higher than 60 represent remarkably high specificity in favor of the substrate with one extra methylene group. In exponentially growing E. coli cells (under aerobic growth on glucose), which contain about 300 microM pyruvate and only 3 microM 2 -ketobutyrate, AHAS I would produce almost entirely AL and only 1 to 2 % AHB. However, isozymes II and III would synthesize AHB (on the pathway to Ile) and AL (on the pathway to valine-leucine) in essentially the ratio required for protein synthesis. The specificity ratio R of any AHAS isozyme was affected neither by the natural feedback inhibitors (Val, Ile) nor by the pH. On the basis of the specificities of the isozymes, the known regulation of AHAS I expression by the catabolite repression system, and the reported behavior of bacterial mutants containing single AHAS isozymes, we suggest that AHAS I enables a bacterium to cope with poor carbon sources, which lead to low endogenous pyruvate concentrations. Although AHAS II and III are well suited to producing the branched-chain amino acid precursors during growth on glucose, they would fail to provide appropriate quantities of AL when the concentration of pyruvate is relatively low...|$|R

The purpose of this work was to determine whether sexually different responses occur in the antioxidant system of poplars after infection by rust disease. Three-month-old male and female P. cathayana individuals were inoculated with M. larici-populina in a greenhouse. After 12 days of incubation, we investigated the changes in physiology, biochemistry, <b>enzyme</b> activities and <b>isozyme</b> profiles.

40|$|Background: Computational {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} metabolic networks {{has been successful in}} metabolic engineering of microbial strains for valuable biochemical production. Limitations of currently available computational methods for metabolic engineering are that they are often based on reaction deletions rather than gene deletions and do not consider the regulatory networks that control metabolism. Due to the presence of multi-functional <b>enzymes</b> and <b>isozymes,</b> computational designs based on reaction deletions can sometimes result in strategies that are genetically complicated or infeasible. Additionally, strains {{might not be able to}} grow initially due to regulatory restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new approach (OptORF) for identifying metabolic engineering strategies based on gene deletion and overexpression. Results: Here we propose an effective method to systematically integrate transcriptional regulatory networks and metabolic networks. This allows for the formulation of linear optimization problems that search for metabolic and/or regulatory perturbations that couple biomass and biochemical production, thus proposing adaptive evolutionary strain designs.

We demonstrate here that transcriptional induction of PDC 6, which encodes a pyruvate decarboxylase isoform with low sulfur content, is directly controlled by Met 4 and its DNA-binding cofactors the basic-helix–loop–helix protein Cbf 1 and the two homologous zinc finger proteins Met 31 and Met 32. Study of Cbf 1 and Met 31 / 32 association with PDC 6 allowed us to find a new mechanism of recruitment of Met 4, which allows PDC 6 being differentially regulated compared to sulfur amino acid biosynthetic genes. Our findings provide a new example of mechanism allowing transcriptional plasticity within a regulatory network thanks to a definite toolbox comprising a unique master activator and several dedicated DNA-binding cofactors. We also show evidence suggesting that integration of PDC 6 to the Met 4 regulon may have occurred recently {{in the evolution of the}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae lineage...|$|R

Comparison of these cDNA sequences with the sequence of the corresponding single gene unequivocally proved that the primary transcript is differentially spliced, potentially giving rise to two polypeptides that differ by 19 amino acids. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the longer transcript constitutes at most 1 % to 2 % of DHQase-SORase transcripts. Expression of the respective polypeptides in Escherichia coli mutants lacking the DHQase or the SORase activity gave functional complementation only in case of the shorter polypeptide, indicating that skipping of a potential exon {{is a prerequisite for}} the production of an enzymatically active protein. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the DHQase-SORase is most likely synthesized as a precursor with a very short (13 -amino acid) plastid-specific transit peptide. Like other genes encoding enzymes of the prechorismate pathway in tomato, this gene is elicitor-inducible.

The synthesis of MD by Pho 1 was markedly accelerated by branching <b>enzyme</b> (BE) <b>isozymes,</b> although the greatest effect was exhibited by the presence of branch-ing isozyme I (BEI) rather than by isozyme IIa (BEIIa) or isozyme IIb (BEIIb). The enhancement of the activity of Pho 1 by BE was not merely due to the supply of a non-reducing ends. At the same time, Pho 1 greatly enhanced the BE activity, possibly by generating a branched carbohydrate substrate which is used by BE with a higher affinity. The addition of isoamylase to the reaction mixture did not prevent the concerted action of Pho 1 and BEI. Furthermore, in the product, the branched structure was, at least to some extent, maintained. Based on these results we propose that the interaction between Pho 1 and BE is not merely due to chain-elongating and chain-branching reac-tions, but occurs in a physically and catalytically synergistic manner by each activating the mutual capacity of the other, presumably forming a physical association of Pho 1, BEI and branched MDs.

Isozymes 3 a, 4, and 6, all of which are present in significant amounts in the liver microsomes from rabbits chronically admini-stered ethanol, exhibited the highest activities in the reconstituted <b>enzyme</b> system, whereas <b>isozymes</b> 3 b and 3 c were 10 - to 20 -fold less effective, and phenobarbital-inducible isozyme 2 was essentially inactive, even in the presence of cytochrome 5. The results obtained thus indicate that induction by ethanol of P- 450 isozyme 3 a (or a homologous enzyme in other species) may contribute to the toxicity of acetaminophen but that other cytochromes also play a significant role...|$|R
5000|$|An {{adaptive}} enzyme or inducible enzyme is an enzyme that is expressed only under {{conditions in which}} it is clear of adaptive value, as opposed to a constitutive enzyme which is produced all the time.The Inducible enzyme is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell. It is also a part of the Operon Model, which illustrates a way for genes to turn [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off".The Inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there's the repressor protein that turns genes off. The inducer can remove this repressor, turning genes back on. The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.An example of inducible enzyme is COX-2 which is synthesized in macrophages to produce Prostaglandin E2 while the constitutive <b>enzyme</b> COX-1 (another <b>isozyme</b> in COX family) is always produced in variety of organs in body (like stomach).|$|R
40|$|A new isozyme of {{cytochrome}} P- 450, designated form 3 a on {{the basis}} of its relative electrophoretic mobility, has been purified to homogeneity from liver microsomes of rabbits treated chronically with ethanol. This cytochrome has the highest activity of the known rabbit P- 450 isozymes in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In view of the reports of others that the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen is increased in ethanol-treated animals and the human alcoholic, we have determined the activity of the six available P- 450 isozymes in the activation of the drug to give an intermediate which forms a conjugate with reduced glutathione. Isozymes 3 a, 4, and 6, the three major forms of cytochrome P- 450 present in liver microsomes from rabbits chronically treated with ethanol, exhibited the highest activities in the recostituted <b>enzyme</b> system, whereas <b>isozymes</b> 3 b and 3 c were 10 - to 20 -fold less effective and phenobarbital-inducible isozyme 2 was essentially inactive, even in the presence of cytochrome b 5. The results obtained thus indicate that induction by ethanol of P- 450 isozyme 3 a may contribute to the toxicity of acetaminophen but that other cytochromes also play a significant role...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if cells which had come in contact with virus exhibited any definite and consistent enzymatic changes prior to the appearance of morphological changes. Another objective was to study enzymatic differences of specific cell cultures which were susceptible to certain viruses and those which were nonsusceptible. Uninfected and virus-infected cells grown in culture were used to describe the quantitative activities of several enzymes during the early stages of infection. Also, the isozyme patterns of some of these enzymes were studied. Specific <b>enzyme</b> activities and <b>isozyme</b> patterns were determined in cell-free extracts from uninfected and virus-infected cell cultures. Samples were harvested before the appearance of morphological changes in the cells. Nine enzymes were tested. Four of these were hydrolytic enzymes and 5 were enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, 2 anaerobic, and 3 aerobic. Primary swine kidney cell cultures were infected with Beran’s enterovirus and transmissible gastro enterovirus. A swine kidney cell line was infected with Beran 2 ̆ 7 s virus and pseudorabies virus. Embryonic bovine kidney cell cultures were infected with pseudorabies virus. Comparable uninfected cell cultures served as controls. Advisor: Marvin J. Twiehau...|$|R
40|$|Multiple sulfatase {{deficiency}} (MSD) is {{an inherited}} disorder characterized by deficient activity of seven different sulfatases. Genetic complementation for steroid sulfatase (STS), arylsulfatase A, and N-acetylgalactosamine 6 -SO 4 sulfatase was demonstrated in somatic cell hybrids between MSD fibroblasts and mouse cells (LA 9) or Chinese hamster cells (CHW). In an electrophoretic system that separates human and rodent STS <b>isozymes,</b> <b>enzyme</b> from hybrids migrated as human enzyme. We {{concluded that the}} rodent cell complemented the MSD deficiency and allowed normal expression of the STS structural gene. Some MSD- LA 9 hybrids showed significant levels of human arylsulfatase A activity, {{as shown by the}} immunoprecipitation of active enzyme by human-specific antiserum. Complementation was also suggested for N-acetylgalactosamine 6 - sulfatate sulfatase (GalNAc- 6 S sulfatase) in several MSD- LA 9 hybrids by the demonstration of a significant increase in activity (10 -fold) over that of the GalNAc- 6 S sulfatase-deficient parental mouse and MSD cells. Thus, it was possible to demonstrate complementation for more than one sulfatase in a single MSD-rodent hybrid. Normal levels of sulfatase activity in hybrids indicate that the sulfatase structural genes are intact in MSD cells...|$|R
40|$|Lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> {{activities}} and <b>isozyme</b> patterns of acid phosphatase were studied in parenchymal cells (PC) and non-parenchymal cells (NPC) isolated separately from normal rat livers. The NPC suspensions prepared by pronase treatment were composed of heterogeneous cell types. About 50 - 60 % of NPC were Kupffer cells and about 30 % of NPC were endothelial cells. The activities of acid phosphatase using adenosine monophosphate (AMP), cytidine monophosphate (CMP), phenyl phosphate (PhP) and β-glycerophosphate (bGP) as substrates and the β-glucuronidase activity were compared between homogenates of PC and NPC. When AMP or CMP {{was used as}} a substrate, the specific activity of acid phosphatase per protein in PC was found to be higher than those in NPC. On the other hand, the activity with PhP and the / 3 -glucuronidase activity were higher in NPC than in PC. The acid phosphatase activity with bGP was about the same in both cell homogenates. The isozyme patterns of acid phosphatase were examined by electrophoresis on the cellulose acetate membrane. Among three major isozyme bands of acid phosphatase in adult rat liver, the most anodic band was the dominant isozyme of NPC and the other two bands were of PC. These results indicate that acid phosphatase in rat liver is qualitatively and quantitatively different between PC and other cell types...|$|R
