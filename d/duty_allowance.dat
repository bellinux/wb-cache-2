Monthly family allowances were reduced from 2,500 to 1,500 CFA francs per child and limited to families with less than six children. These unpopular measures allowed him to reduce the budget deficit by 4.5%.

40|$|Implementation of {{policies}} (decisions) {{in the health}} sector is sometimes defeated by the system’s response to the policy itself. This can lead to counter-intuitive, unanticipated, or more modest effects than expected by those who designed the policy. The health sector fits the characteristics of complex adaptive systems (CAS) and complexity {{is at the heart}} of this phenomenon. Anticipating both positive and negative effects of policy decisions, understanding the interests, power and interaction between multiple actors; and planning for the delayed and distal impact of policy decisions are essential for effective decision making in CAS. Failure to appreciate these elements often leads to a series of reductionist approach interventions or ‘fixes’. This in turn can initiate a series of negative feedback loops that further complicates the situation over time. In this paper we use a case study of the Additional <b>Duty</b> Hours <b>Allowance</b> (ADHA) policy in Ghana to illustrate these points. Using causal loop diagrams, we unpack the intended and unintended effects of the policy and how these effects evolved over time. The overall goal is to advance our understanding of decision making in complex adaptive systems; and through this process identify some essential elements in formulating, updating and implementing health policy that can help to improve attainment of desired outcomes and minimize negative unintended effects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis {{of the effects of}} nominal exchange rate movements on cross-border travel by consumers and on retail firms' sales. We develop a search-theoretic model of price-setting heterogeneous retailers and traveling consumers who face nominal exchange rate shocks. These exchange rate shocks act as both a supply side shock for retailers though imported input prices and a demand side shock though their effect on the propensity for consumers to cross the border and shop at foreign retail stores. The model provides predictions regarding relationships between firm and regional characteristics and the magnitude of the effects of nominal exchange rate fluctuations and resulting cross-border travel activity on retailers' sales. We use our theoretical framework to motivate an empirical methodology applied to Canadian firm and consumer level data from 1987 to 2007. Our findings indicate that an appreciation of the Canadian dollar substantially increases cross border travel which in turn has a significant negative effect on the sales of Canadian retailers. These effects diminish with the distance of the retailer from the border and with the shopping opportunities available at relevant US destinations. Using counterfactual experiments, we quantify the effects of more restrictive border controls after September 2001 which discouraged cross-border trips and reduced retailer losses from cross-border shopping as well as the effects of increased <b>duty</b> free <b>allowances</b> which raised cross-border trips and reduced retailer sales...|$|R
40|$|In my ﬁrst paper I {{examine the}} impact of {{short-term}} economic shocks on physician migration using a new panel dataset on physician migration from 31 African countries to the US and the UK. I estimate distributed-lag regressions of log migration on economic growth, I also instrument for growth using rainfall and changes in terms of trade. I ﬁnd a signiﬁcant eﬀect of economic conditions: a one percentage point decline in lagged growth increases physician out-migration by approximately 0. 3 percent. In the IV models, a one percentage point decline in lagged growth increases physician out-migration by between 3. 4 and 3. 6 percent. In my second paper, I examine {{the impact of}} doctors’ earnings. The Ghanaian Government in 1998 instituted a scheme known as the Additional <b>Duty</b> Hours <b>Allowance</b> (ADHA) Scheme which compensated doctors for any additional hours worked beyond the standard 40 hours a week/ 160 hours a month. I exploit this natural experiment to derive estimates of the impact of doctors’ earnings. Using innovative new methods developed by Abadie et al. (2007) and applying it to physician stock data collected by Docquier et al. (2007), I ﬁnd that by 2004 - six years after the program was instituted - the foreign stock of Ghanaian physicians had reduced by between 10 and 13 percent and attribute this directly to the eﬀect of the ADHA program. In my third paper I examine the demand for preventive care. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in developing countries. Despite compelling evidence that cervical cancer screening has reduced morbidity and mortality in de- veloped countries, screening rates in many developing countries remain low. In this paper I examine the importance of demand-side factors on take-up of cervical screening. Using a randomized design, I test for the impact of price and of a conditional cancer treatment subsidy. Overall I ﬁnd a signiﬁcant impact of both interventions. A N 10 increase in price of screening reduced take-up of the program by between 7 and 8 percentage points while women selected to receive the cancer treatment subsidy were about 4 percentage points more likely to participate in screening...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import <b>duty,</b> and depreciation <b>allowances.</b> Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays {{in the presence of}} accelerated depreciation allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the assumption}} that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the depreciation allowance is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer accelerated depreciation allowance but can claim normal depreciation allowance only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal depreciation allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the depreciation allowance. ...|$|R

60|$|If, then, {{the real}} state {{of this nation}} is such as I have described, (and I am only {{apprehensive}} that you may think I have taken too much pains to exclude all doubt on this question,)--if no class is lessened in its numbers, or in its stock, or in its conveniences, or even its luxuries,--if they build as many habitations, and as elegant and as commodious as ever, and furnish them with every chargeable decoration and every prodigality of ingenious invention that {{can be thought of}} by those who even incumber their necessities with superfluous accommodation,--if they are as numerously attended,--if their equipages are as splendid,--if they regale at table with as much or more variety of plenty than ever,--if they are clad in as expensive and changeful a diversity, according to their tastes and modes,--if they are not deterred from the pleasures of the field by the charges which government has wisely turned from the culture to the sports of the field,--if the theatres are as rich and as well filled, and greater and at a higher price than ever,--and (what is more important than all) if it is plain, from the treasures which are spread over the soil or confided to the winds and the seas, that there are as many who are indulgent to their propensities of parsimony as others to their voluptuous desires, and that the pecuniary capital grows instead of diminishing,--on what ground are we authorized to say that a nation gambolling in an ocean of superfluity is undone by want? With what face can we pretend that they who have not denied any one gratification to any one appetite have a right to plead poverty in order to famish their virtues and to put their <b>duties</b> on short <b>allowance?</b> that they are to take the law from an imperious enemy, and can contribute no longer to the honor of their king, to the support of the independence of their country, to the salvation of that Europe which, if it falls, must crush them with its gigantic ruins? How can they affect to sweat and stagger and groan under their burdens, to whom the mines of Newfoundland, richer than those of Mexico and Peru, are now thrown in as a make-weight in the scale of their exorbitant opulence? What excuse can they have to faint, and creep, and cringe, and prostrate themselves at the footstool of ambition and crime, who, during a short, though violent struggle, which they have never supported with the energy of men, have amassed more to their annual accumulation than all the well-husbanded capital that enabled their ancestors, by long and doubtful and obstinate conflicts, to defend and liberate and vindicate the civilized world? But I do not accuse the people of England. As to the great majority of the nation, they have done whatever, in their several ranks and conditions and descriptions, was required of them by their relative situations in society: and from those the great mass of mankind cannot depart, without the subversion of all public order. They look up to that government which they obey that they may be protected. They ask to be led and directed by those rulers whom Providence and the laws of their country have set over them, and under their guidance to walk in the ways of safety and honor. They have again delegated the greatest trust which they have to bestow to those faithful representatives who made their true voice heard against the disturbers and destroyers of Europe. They suffered, with unapproving acquiescence, solicitations, which they had in no shape desired, to an unjust and usurping power, whom they had never provoked, and whose hostile menaces they did not dread. When the exigencies of the public service could only be met by their voluntary zeal, they started forth with an ardor which outstripped the wishes of those who had injured them by doubting whether it might not be necessary to have recourse to compulsion. They have in all things reposed an enduring, but not an unreflecting confidence. That confidence demands a full return, and fixes a responsibility on the ministers entire and undivided. The people stands acquitted, if the war is not carried on in a manner suited to its objects. If the public honor is tarnished, if the public safety suffers any detriment, the ministers, not the people, are to answer it, and they alone. Its armies, its navies, are given to them without stint or restriction. Its treasures are poured out at their feet. Its constancy is ready to second all their efforts. They are not to fear a responsibility for acts of manly adventure. The responsibility which they are to dread is lest they should show themselves unequal to the expectation of a brave people. The more doubtful may be the constitutional and economical questions upon which they have received so marked a support, the more loudly they are called upon to support this great war, for the success of which their country is willing to supersede considerations of no slight importance. Where I speak of responsibility, I do not mean to exclude that species of it which the legal powers of the country have a right finally to exact from those who abuse a public trust: but high as this is, there is a responsibility which attaches on them from which the whole legitimate power of the kingdom cannot absolve them; there is a responsibility to conscience and to glory, a responsibility to the existing world, and to that posterity which men of their eminence cannot avoid for glory or for shame,--a responsibility to a tribunal at which not only ministers, but kings and parliaments, but even nations themselves, must one day answer.|$|R

The study was guided by four research objectives which were (i) To assess the factors affecting the job turnover for teachers in government schools in Babati Town council (ii) To assess the retention strategies used by the community to enhance teachers’ retention (iii) To compare the retention strategies used by private and public schools administrators to enhance teachers’ retention (iv) To assess the role of students in enhancing teachers’ retention. The study used both qualitative and quantitative approach where the sample of 191 respondents of different categories was interviewed and the data of the study was collected through structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Simple random sampling was used to select the respondent of the study. The key findings of the study indicated that low salary, distance from home to school, lack of motivation, lack of morale and poor respect of teaching profession as well as lack profession development were the major reasons which cause teachers turnover in many government schools in Babati Town council. Also the study showed that the community have great role of making teachers to remains in schools if they were incorporated. Furthermore, the study showed that the private schools have managed to retain teachers because their administrators motivate them by providing extra <b>duty</b> <b>allowance,</b> giving them housing and rewarding top performers. It was concluded that in order the government schools to perform better they should have good and enough teachers in all teaching subjects. Therefore, this study recommends that if the government wants to retain teachers and to compete with private schools, the government should increase teacher’s salary so as to commensurate with their qualifications...|$|E
