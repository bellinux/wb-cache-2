5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811.

5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city failed and, due to the Crusaders' lack of resources, the siege became a stalemate. However, the arrival of {{craftsman}} and supplies transported by the Genoese to Jaffa tilted the balance <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favour.</b> Crusaders constructed two large siege engines; the one commanded by Godfrey breached the walls on 15July 1099. For two days the Crusaders massacred the inhabitants and pillaged the city. Historians now believe the accounts of the numbers killed have been exaggerated, but this narrative of massacre did much to cement the Crusaders' reputation for barbarism. Godfrey further secured the Frankish position by surprising the Egyptian relief force commanded by the vizier of the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, at Ascalon. This relief force retreated to Egypt, with the vizier fleeing by ship. At this point most of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe, leaving behind Godfrey with a mere 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend Palestine. Of the other princes, only Tancred remained with the ambition to gain his own princedom.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{specialty}} {{choices of}} the UK medical graduates of 2005, 2008 and 2009, {{one year after}} graduation, with those of graduates from previous years and with the distribution of senior medical practitioners working in England. METHOD: Postal questionnaire surveys. RESULTS: The proportion of graduates giving more than one specialty choice rose {{in the most recent}} cohorts. Among men, choices for surgical careers fell from 37 % of 2005 graduates to 25 % of 2008 and 2009 graduates. The percentages who specified anaesthetics, general practice and obstetrics and gynaecology rose. Among women, general practice and surgery were unchanged in popularity, but increasing percentages specified paediatrics, anaesthetics and obstetrics and gynaecology. Choices for psychiatry and emergency medicine showed no trend. General practice was substantially under-represented, and hospital surgical and medical specialties were over-represented, in choices when compared to the distribution of senior National Health Service doctors. CONCLUSION: More current graduates consider two or more specialties than did their predecessors, which may reflect an increase in uncertainty about obtaining a post <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favoured</b> specialty. The specialty preferences expressed by newly qualified doctors, notably the shortfall in numbers choosing general practice, remain inconsistent with future service needs...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the first}} half, Chelsea {{continued}} to dominate possession and round-up more opportunities – the ball was given to Wise, after cooperation between Petrescu and Vialli, whose shot went just across the left goal. It did not take long, before Granville generated another endeavor for Chelsea to make Wohlfahrt throw himself to the right {{in order to prevent}} the shot. The club made its first substitute change in the 71st minute, which saw Flo being replaced by Zola. He made an effect immediately, picking up the ball after a well-timed pass by Wise, and finishing with a half volley in the penalty box, past Wohlfahrt, which found its way straight in the top right corner. As the match went on, Petrescu was sent off for an illegal tackle on Yakin.

Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after an 0–0 extra-time draw.

In the semi-finals, they defeated FC Zürich of Switzerland 6–1 on aggregate to reach the final, where they met their opponents from the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, Borussia Mönchengladbach. The final was held in Rome, four days after the club had lost the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Before the match, Paisley announced that striker Toshack would be fit to start.

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially {{had no need to}} seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favour,</b> as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|In 814, Wulfred {{travelled}} to Rome {{to visit}} Pope Leo III. Although {{the exact nature}} of his business with the pope is unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries. He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half-century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the– then victorious– Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active {{in the last years of}} Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favour</b> which purported to have been issued by earlier kings.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{for high}} temperature tolerance exists in wheat cultivars. Identifying key metabolic steps {{in this regard}} will help in improving grain yield. Effect of high temperature on activities of sucrose metabolizing enzymes and aminotransferases in relation to transformation of free sugars to starch and protein in developing grains of four wheat cultivars PBW 343, PBW 550, C 306, C 273 was studied by raising the crop under normal (October) and late planting (December) conditions. Significant reduction in chlorophyll content and increase in membrane injury index and lipid peroxidation were observed in all the cultivars. C 306 and C 273 showed higher membrane stability over PBW 343, PBW 550. High temperature accentuated sucrolytic enzymes and aminotransferases while activities of sucrose synthase/phosphate synthase got repressed. Higher build up of sugars and starch in PBW 343, PBW 550 cvs over C 306, C 273 resulted in higher yield in the former but their lower membrane integrity under heat stress leads to yield reductions. Disruption of starch biosynthesis resulted <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favoured</b> utilization <b>in</b> nitrogen metabolism leading to higher amino acid and protein accumulation. Results indicated that sustainability for yield enhancement under stress could be possible by cross-breeding high yielding cvs PBW with increased membrane stability C ones for increasing thermotolerance.

40|$|SUMMARY: Lowland native grasslands {{are among}} the most {{depleted}} ecosystems in south-eastern Australia, and contain a disproportionately large number of threatened plant species. Threatened grassland fauna such as the Plains-wanderer have suffered a similar decline. Plains-wanderers are permanent residents <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favoured</b> patches of sparse native grassland. However, they cannot survive where these grasslands are converted to crops or dense introduced pasture, or are overgrazed by stock. In the five years since the publication of the first RAOU Plains-wanderer Conservation Statement in 1993, considerable effort has been expended in surveying and studying the temperate native grasslands of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This work has revealed that the status of the Plains-wanderer is worse than previously thought. A very significant new threat has emerged from an expanding rice industry in the Plains-wanderer’s stronghold, the Riverina of New South Wales. The situation for Plainswanderers in Queensland remains unclear, but {{there is no reason to}} suspect that it is improving given the expansion of the cotton industry and conversion of native grasslands to introduced pasture there. On the positive side, recent studies have provided refined information on managing native grasslands to maintain their biodiversity, and they provide some clear targets for urgent conservation action.

In 1650 Montrose attempted another rising in the Highlands {{in the name of}} the King, but it ended disastrously, with Montrose being executed. Lacking tangible support from his relatives on the continent or his supporters in England, Charles accepted the offer from the Covenanters, arriving in June 1650 and signing the Covenants. The English responded with an army of 16,000 under Cromwell, which crossed the border in July 1650, while an English fleet acted in support. On 3 September 1650 the English army defeated the Scots under David Leslie at the Battle of Dunbar, taking over 10,000 prisoners and then occupying Edinburgh, taking control of the Lowlands.

40|$|AbstractSix rice varieties, PR 120, PR 116, FengAiZan, PR 115, PAU 201 and Punjab Mehak 1 {{were raised}} under aerobic and {{transplanting}} conditions {{to assess the}} effects of planting conditions on sucrose metabolising enzymes {{in relation to the}} transformation of free sugars to starch and protein in flag leaves and grains. Activities of sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase and acid invertase increased till flowering stage in leaves and mid-milky stage (14 d after flowering) in grains and thereafter declined in concomitant with the contents of reducing sugar. Under aerobic conditions, the activities of acid invertase and sucrose synthase (cleavage) significantly decreased in conjunction with the decrease in non-reducing sugars and starch content in all the varieties. Disruption of starch biosynthesis under the influence of aerobic conditions in both leaves and grains and the higher build up of sugars possibly resulted <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>favoured</b> utilization <b>in</b> nitrogen metabolism. FengAiZan, PR 115 and PR 120 maintained higher levels of sucrose synthase enzymes in grains and leaves and contents of metabolites (amino acid, protein and non-reducing sugar) under aerobic conditions, while PR 116, Punjab Mehak 1 and PAU 201 performed better under transplanting conditions, thus showing their adaptation to environmental stress. Yield gap between aerobic and transplanting rice is attributed primarily to the difference in sink activity and strength. Overall, it appear that up-regulation of sucrose synthase (synthesis) and sucrose phosphate synthase under aerobic conditions might be responsible in enhancing growth and productivity of rice varieties...|$|R
