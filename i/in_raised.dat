5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking <b>in</b> <b>raised</b> voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

500|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched gable-over-hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill {{course and the}} now painted grey brownstone stringcourse, window sills and lintels and the lintels of the doors. The enclosed entry pavilion projects from the main block with two porches oriented to face Fountain Street and Blake Street. Three arched double hung windows with two-over-two sash run {{along the sides of}} the building with three smaller windows are in the entry pavilion. At the time of the National Register of Historic Places nomination, these smaller windows were boarded up and the porch oriented to Fountain Street was bricked in with the buildings original materials.

500|$|The white mob burned {{black churches}} in Rosewood. [...] Philomena Goins' cousin, Lee Ruth Davis, heard the bells tolling {{in the church}} as the men were inside setting it on fire. The mob also {{destroyed}} the white church in Rosewood. Many black residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps, some clothed only in their pajamas. Wilson Hall {{was nine years old}} at the time; he later recounted his mother waking him to escape [...] into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark; the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles. The Hall family walked [...] through swampland to the town of Gulf Hammock. The survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for Florida, and people suffered when they spent several nights <b>in</b> <b>raised</b> wooded areas called hammocks to evade the mob. Some took refuge with sympathetic white families. Sam Carter's 69-year-old widow hid for two days in the swamps, then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier, under bags of mail, to join her family in Chiefland.|$|E
