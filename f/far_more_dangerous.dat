The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza would be <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident {{the war was over}} and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 160s, Germanic {{tribes and}} other nomadic people {{launched}} raids along the Northern border, particularly into Gaul {{and across the}} Danube. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes farther east.

25|$|The third {{game was}} played on 11 November 2014. Anand's {{superior}} opening preparation was the decisive factor in this game. In a sharp, topical variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined involving an early Queen's side attack by White, he improved on an earlier game between Levon Aronian and Michael Adams. He soon had a clear advantage, his c-pawn on the 7th rank being <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> than Carlsen's passed a-pawn. Carlsen, down to 6 minutes, blundered with 28...Ba5?, although his position was very bad anyway. Anand leveled the match at 1½–1½.

25|$|The Democratic-Republican Party {{planned to}} have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the {{remaining}} elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each.

25|$|OZ was one {{of several}} 'underground' {{publications}} targeted by the Obscene Publications Squad, and their offices had already been raided on several occasions, but the conjunction of schoolchildren and what some viewed as obscene material set the scene for the Oz obscenity trial of 1971. In one key respect it was a virtual re-run of the second Australian trial—the judicial instruction was clearly aimed at securing a conviction, and like Gerald Locke in Sydney, the judge hearing the London case, Justice Michael Argyle, exhibited clear signs of bias against the defendants. However the British trial was given a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> edge because the prosecution employed an archaic charge against Neville, Dennis and Anderson"conspiracy to corrupt public morals"which, in theory, carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Another form of skin cancer, {{malignant}} melanoma, is {{much less}} common but <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous,</b> being lethal in about 15–20 {{percent of the cases}} diagnosed. The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet exposure is not yet fully understood, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved. Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on melanoma incidence. One study showed that a 10 percent increase in UVB radiation was associated with a 19 percent increase in melanomas for men and 16 percent for women. A study of people in Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of Chile, showed a 56 percent increase in melanoma and a 46 percent increase in nonmelanoma skin cancer over a period of seven years, along with decreased ozone and increased UVB levels.|$|E

[...] By the early 1990s, Travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side, and it quietly exited its original business in 1994. What was left of Travelers' travel insurance business was acquired by three former employees and is now known as Travel Insured International.|$|R

25|$|Kaykhusraw II (1237–1246) {{began his}} reign by {{capturing}} the region around Diyarbakır, but in 1239 {{he had to}} face an uprising led by a popular preacher named Baba Ishak.

The forces of the Mongol Empire took Erzurum in 1242 and in 1243, the sultan was crushed by Baiju in the Battle of Köse Dağ (a mountain between the cities of Sivas and Erzincan), and the Seljuq Turks were forced to swear allegiance to the Mongols and became their vassals. The sultan himself had fled to Antalya after the 1243 battle, where he died in 1246, his death starting a period of tripartite, and then dual, rule that lasted until 1260.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} Sinhala populace, {{including}} the Kandyan aristocracy, and the Nayakkars remained fraught throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. As early as Narendrasinha's reign, attempts at appointing Nayakkars to prominent positions in court had caused rebellion, {{including one in}} 1732 that the king had only been able to crush with Dutch assistance. The Nayakkar nobility – which tended to be exclusivist and monopolise access to the king – was seen as forming an elite group privileged above the native aristocracy, the powerful adigars. Though Sri Vijaya Rajasinha's reign (1739–1747) proved relatively peaceful, his successor Kirti Sri Rajasinha {{had to deal with}} two major rebellions. The first, in 1749, was directed at his father Narenappa; the second, in 1760, was a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> insurrection which attempted to replace him with a Siamese prince. Despite these tensions, however, the Nayakkar dynasty endured, establishing support by their patronage of Buddhism and Kandyan culture.|$|E
500|$|The second Arab {{siege of}} Constantinople was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> for Byzantium {{than the first}} as, unlike the loose {{blockade}} of 674–678, the Arabs launched a direct, well-planned attack on the Byzantine capital, and tried {{to cut off the}} city completely from land and sea. The siege represented a final effort by the Caliphate to [...] "cut off the head" [...] of the Byzantine Empire, after which the remaining provinces, especially in Asia Minor, would be easy to capture. The Arab failure was chiefly logistical, as they were operating too far from their Syrian bases, but the superiority of the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire, the strength of Constantinople's fortifications, and the skill of Leo III in deception and negotiations also played important roles.|$|E

[...] Knauf had the intention of marrying Brother Justin to Sofie at some point in the future, and the third season would have shown a three-year-old boy amidst Sofie and the Crowes. Knauf left the question about the child's parents open. Ben's future would face other hardships. According to Knauf, Ben's wounds of the season 2 finale would require repeated suturing, causing him to lose his Vitae Divina and draining him of strength. Ben would be a different man than he was before, with a personality closer to Management, and while he and Sofie would be bound together by love, their ultimate fates remain uncertain.|$|R

Having {{disrupted}} the cycle of master/slave by receiving what he wanted, the pair can no longer stand one another. It is not known what happened to Daniel after the separation. We obtain insight into Daniel and his relationship with Armand in The Vampire Armand. Armand states that he made Daniel a vampire out of loneliness, and because Daniel was dying. Armand believes a vampire will inevitably come to hate its creator, so he knew in making Daniel immortal that he was setting into motion {{the end of their}} relationship. At the time of The Vampire Armand, Armand knows that Daniel is alive, wandering, and powerful enough to survive on his own.
