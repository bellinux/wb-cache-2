5|$|Article X {{establishes}} {{the basic structure}} for taxation of personal property in Virginia. Pursuant to this Article, all non-exempt real and personal property is subject to taxation at its <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Section 6 sets out a lengthy list of exempt property, which includes church property, cemeteries, and non-profit school property.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%, while the tax rate on food is 1.5%. There is an additional 1% local tax, {{for a total of}} a 5.3% combined sales tax on most Virginia purchases and 2.5% on most food. Virginia's property tax is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth. Real estate is also taxed at the local level based on 100% of <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Tangible personal property also is taxed at the local level and is based on a percentage or percentages of original cost.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E

5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll {{as long as she}} was paid no more than the <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for her services. In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, had planted a bogus candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the fate of 5,900 artefacts retrieved from the wreck would rest with a U.S. District Judge's decision. The ruling was later issued in two decisions on 12 August 2010 and 15 August 2011. As announced in 2009, the judge ruled that RMS Titanic Inc. owned the artefacts and her decision dealt with the status of the wreck as well as establishing a monitoring system to check future activity upon the wreck site. On 12August 2010, Judge Rebecca Beach Smith granted RMSTitanic, Inc. <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for the artefacts but deferred ruling on their ownership and the conditions for their preservation, possible disposition and exhibition until a further decision could be reached. On 15 August 2011, Judge Smith granted title to thousands of artefacts from the Titanic, that RMS Titanic Inc. did not already own under a French court decision concerning the first group of salvaged artefacts, to RMS Titanic Inc. subject to a detailed list of conditions concerning preservation and disposition of the items. The artefacts can be sold only to a company that would abide by the lengthy list of conditions and restrictions. RMS Titanic Inc. can profit from the artefacts through exhibiting them.|$|E

5000|$|Economist Joseph Stiglitz {{criticized the}} plan {{proposed}} by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to purchase toxic assets: [...] "Paying <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>values</b> for the assets will not work. Only by overpaying for the assets will the banks be adequately recapitalized. But overpaying for the assets simply shifts the losses to the government. In other words, the Geithner plan works only {{if and when}} the taxpayer loses big time." [...] He stated that toxic asset purchases represents [...] "ersatz capitalism," [...] meaning gains are privatized while losses are socialized.|$|R

50|$|The {{self-dealing}} {{and conflict}} of interest types of prohibited transactions, as outlined in IRC sections 4975(c)(1)(D) and 4975(c)(1)(E), are the broadest and most reaching categories of prohibited transaction. To trigger a self-dealing or {{conflict of interest}} transaction, the IRS simply has {{to show that a}} disqualified person received some direct or indirect personal benefit. If the account owner or beneficiary engaged in a prohibited transaction, the account is treated as distributing all its assets to the IRA holder at their <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>values</b> {{on the first day of}} the year in which the transaction occurred. The distribution would be subject to any taxes or penalties associated with an early distribution: generally, a 10% early withdrawal penalty and treatment of the distribution as ordinary income for the purposes of income taxes.|$|R
40|$|Subprime {{mortgage}} loans were the catalyst, not the cause, of the crisis. Policy errors {{in both the}} public and private sectors stretch back nearly 40 years. Inflation, monetary policy and lax regulation all played a role in allowing individual greed and irrational risk-taking to flourish. The paper provides background to the mania that generated an alphabet-soup of derivative â€œobligationsâ€ with uncertainâ€”possibly unknowable-values. The growth of derivatives and the failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are linked to the tenfold growth of median house prices in the United States, which ballooned from $ 11, 900 in 1960 to $ 120, 000 in 2000. Residential properties became trading inventory for speculators rather than fixed assets for homeowners.

25|$|The {{value of}} a company's {{intangible}} assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value.

5000|$|On February 10, 2009, {{the newly}} {{confirmed}} Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner outlined {{his plan to}} use the $300 billion or so dollars remaining in the TARP funds. He mentioned that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve wanted to help fund private investors to buy toxic assets from banks, but few details have yet been released. [...] There is still some scepticism about the premise that taxpayers can buy troubled assets without having to overpay. Oppenheimer & Company analyst Meridith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>values</b> because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. Because stock is a call option on a firm's assets, this lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.|$|R

Banking analyst Meridith Whitney argued that banks would not sell bad assets at <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>values</b> because they would be reluctant to take asset writedowns. However, just months after PPIP began, the debt became a money-maker when the bonds rallied and banks, instead of purging their balance sheets of toxic assets, began buying more home loan bonds lacking government guarantees. Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs added a combined $3.36 billion of the debt, which just months earlier, had been of little interest to buyers.|$|R
