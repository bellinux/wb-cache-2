5|$|Uranium and osmium were early {{successful}} catalysts in the Haber process, {{the nitrogen}} fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia, giving enough yield {{to make the}} process economically successful. At the time, a group at BASF led by Carl Bosch bought most of the world's supply of osmium {{to use as a}} catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the <b>first</b> <b>pilot</b> plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium.|$|E

Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|Mayer {{claimed his}} first {{victories}} over United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) four-engine bombers on 23 November 1942.

5|$|A five-man crew, the <b>first</b> <b>pilot,</b> co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated {{within the}} pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces {{launched}} an offensive in Western Europe, but Wick {{remained on the}} ground while his aircraft, Bf 109 Yellow 2, underwent an engine change. Seven days later, {{he was back in}} the air, recording three victories over French LeO 45 bombers in one mission. By 6 June, Wick had 10 confirmed and two unconfirmed victories, including four French Bloch 151/152 fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fifth through eighth victories. The two unconfirmed victories were Royal Navy Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had no witnesses. On 6 June, Wick became the <b>first</b> <b>pilot</b> of the I. Gruppe to complete 100 combat missions, claiming his ninth and tenth victory the same day. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class by Oberstleutnant Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp. By the end of the French Campaign, Wick's total stood at 14 confirmed victories, trailing only Hauptmann (Captain) Mölders of JG53 with 25 victories and Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar of JG27 with 23 victories as the Luftwaffes top scorer. At the end of the French campaign, 3. Staffel headquarters moved into the house of Louis Aston Knight, an artist who had fled {{a few days before the}} Germans arrived.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The <b>first</b> <b>pilot</b> landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} {{tempered}} this achievement. Despite shooting down two more aircraft, {{it was the}} first time he had lost his wingman. Unteroffizier Johann Kalb had to bail out over the Volga River and was captured by Soviet troops. On 17 September he claimed three more victories but a 20mm Soviet cannon-shell went through his canopy, narrowly missing his head. On 23 September, he scored a remarkable ten victories in three missions, taking him to 197. On 26 September, he became the <b>first</b> <b>pilot</b> in aviation history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down. The 62 victories he claimed in that single month (of September) remain a record unbeaten in aviation history. Elevated to hero status by the Luftwaffe, he was promoted to Major on 29 September and forbidden from flying further combat missions. The whole of JG52 gathered at Soldatskaja to congratulate him before he flew back to Berlin a few days later.|$|E
