During <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> through <b>the</b> {{condenser}} <b>of</b> a refrigerator, {{it generally}} undergoes <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> desuperheating, condensation and sub-cooling. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> important criteria in condenser design is {{to locate the}} points where superheated refrigerant vapour changes to saturated vapour and subsequently from wet vapour to saturated liquid. The present paper discusses <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> wire-and-tube condenser under normal operating conditions of free convection using FEM where Galerkin’s weighted residual method is used to minimise <b>the</b> errors. <b>Refrigerant</b> R- 134 a is considered for the study and the condenser components are divided into several elements where <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>refrigerant</b> is predicted. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> ambient temperature and mass flow rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> are also determined. This is used to find out <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> tube required for phase change for its initiation and completion. The methodology adopted is validated against the simulation data available in the literature for both sensible and latent heat transfer. The analysis also leads to the information about <b>the</b> adequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> tubes for complete condensation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> vapour under given operating conditions.

In this paper a two-phase heat transfer characterization of an innovative aluminum minichannel heat exchanger is presented.

A special test section has been projected and realized in the Two Phase Heat Transfer Lab <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Padova {{in order to measure}} the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) on <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> side during flow boiling and condensation.

50|$|A single-pressure {{absorption}} refrigerator takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that a}} substance's boiling point depends upon <b>the</b> partial pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vapor above the liquid and goes down with lower partial pressure. While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (therefore low boiling point) in <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system that draws heat out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-temperature interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refrigerator, but maintains <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> at high partial pressure (therefore high boiling point) in <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator.|$|R
40|$|Aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{paper is}} a numerical-experimental {{analysis}} for an air cooled evaporator working with refrigerant R 22, in steady-state conditions. A homogeneous model for <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> is considered; {{this model is}} capable <b>of</b> predicting <b>the</b> distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant</b> temperature, <b>the</b> velocity, the void fraction, the tube wall temperature, the air temperature and the humidity along the test evaporator. A comparison with the measurements on a dry expansion evaporator mounted in an air channel linked to a vapour compression plant is discussed. The {{results show that the}} model provides a reasonable estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steady-state response...|$|R
40|$|A single {{expander}} {{process with}} nitrogen as refrigerant has been optimized for liquefaction of natural gas. Comparisons {{have been made}} between a simplified process model assuming constant specific heat capacities and ideal gas behavior for <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> and a rigorous model employing <b>the</b> Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation <b>of</b> state. For <b>the</b> simplified model, equations have been developed that enable an analytical solution to the optimization problem. Quite surprisingly, there is good agreement between the models when the minimum temperature difference is small. For the remaining cases, better solutions are obtained from the rigorous model accounting for <b>the</b> non-ideal behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerant...</b>|$|R
