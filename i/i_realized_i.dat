He said that despite not usually revealing his personal life publicly, {{he said in an interview}} that when he makes his music, : [...] "it's always just there, and it happens, but I don't focus on it.

500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years.

500|$|Initially, Nolan {{wrote an}} 80-page {{treatment}} about dream-stealers. Originally, Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film {{even though he}} found that [...] "traditionally [...] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms." [...] Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story [...] "relies so heavily {{on the idea of}} the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> needed to raise the emotional stakes." [...] Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years. When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by [...] "that era of movies where you had The Matrix (1999), you had Dark City (1998), you had The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had Memento (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written.

In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom."

500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> needed to show in one {{situation}} that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E
500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E
