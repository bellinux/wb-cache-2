5000|$|Andrew Butler {{was born}} and raised in Denver, Colorado, and has {{described}} growing up in [...] "a violent household without any role models". He developed an early love for Greek mythology, which later inspired him to name his band after the mythological hero of Hercules. Interested in music, he played the piano, and began composing classical pieces from the age of thirteen. Butler's interest switched to focus on dance music after buying a record by the band Yazoo. He went on to give his first DJ set aged fifteen, in a Denver leather bar run by a <b>hostess</b> <b>called</b> Chocolate Thunder Pussy; on that occasion, the club was raided by police, leading him to hide from them in the toilets. As he later related: [...] "I started DJing because I needed to get out of the house. I was, like, 'Take me to the club or there's going to be a really ugly situation at home today!' I found a lot of freedom in the nightclub to express myself and not be judged as harshly as I was at home. I am a gay man and I grew up with a certain struggle and because of that, I have a story to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was in a}} panic. But the <b>hostess,</b> {{instead of}} <b>calling</b> for the police, gushed, [...] "So glad you could come!" [...] {{combining}} a kittenish mechanical smile for him with a glance {{over his shoulder at}} the temporary butler. [...] "I want you to meet Miss Moeller, Mr.--uh--Mr----" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Astor in the 1950s {{has been}} {{described}} as having been [...] "littered with prostitutes, which the club politely <b>called</b> <b>hostesses,</b> who'd wait for a table to be filled and then order champagne for the guests at £2 a bottle. They'd get a pound for each bottle purchased, earning up to a tenner on good nights." [...] This {{at a time when most}} workers were paid between £2 and £9 per week.|$|R
50|$|Paying {{to dance}} with a female {{employee}} is available in some nightclubs of the United States, including many in Los Angeles. These clubs no longer use the ticket-a-dance system, but have time-clocks and punch-cards that allow the patron {{to pay for the}} dancer's time by the hour. Some of these modern dance clubs operate in buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. No longer called taxi-dance halls, these latter-day establishments are now <b>called</b> <b>hostess</b> clubs.|$|R
60|$|Investigation {{proved the}} surmise correct. Fortunately I was still alone, and in {{consequence}} was able, {{a few minutes}} later, to meet my hostess with calm and dignity. I said nothing about the rocking-chair. As a matter of fact, I was hoping to have the pleasure, before I went, of seeing some other guest arrive and sample it: I had purposely replaced it in the most prominent and convenient position. But though I felt capable of schooling myself to silence, I found myself unable to agree with my <b>hostess</b> when she <b>called</b> for my admiration of the thing. My recent experiences had too deeply embittered me.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were still}} more serious {{circumstances}} when exasperation at the flippant tone about him carried him beyond the ordinary bounds of that polite time. A guest at table asked contemptuously {{what was the}} use of a nation like the French having reason, if they did not use it. [...] "They mock the other nations of the earth, and yet are the most credulous of all." [...] ROUSSEAU: [...] "I forgive them for their credulity, but not for condemning those who are credulous in some other way." [...] Some one said that in matters of religion everybody was right, but that everybody should remain in that in which he had been born. ROUSSEAU, with warmth: [...] "Not so, by God, if it is a bad one, for then it can do nothing but harm." [...] Then some one contended that religion always did some good, as a kind of rein to the common people who had no other morality. All the rest cried out at this in indignant remonstrance, one shrewd person remarking that the common people had much livelier fear of being hanged than of being damned. The conversation was broken off for a moment by the <b>hostess</b> <b>calling</b> out, [...] "After all, one must nourish the tattered affair we call our body, so ring and let them bring us the joint." [...] This done, the servants dismissed, and the door shut, the discussion was resumed with such vehemence by Duclos and Saint Lambert, that, says the lady who tells us the story, [...] "I feared they were bent on destroying all religion, and I prayed for some mercy to be shown at any rate to natural religion." [...] There was not a whit more sympathy for that than for the rest. Rousseau declared himself paullo infirmior, and clung to the morality of the gospel as the natural morality which in old times constituted the whole and only creed. [...] "But what is a God," [...] cried one impetuous disputant, [...] "who gets angry and is appeased again?" [...] Rousseau began to murmur between grinding teeth, and a tide of pleasantries set in at his expense, to which came this: [...] "If it is a piece of cowardice to suffer ill to be spoken of one's friend behind his back, 'tis a crime to suffer ill to be spoken of one's God, who is present; and for my part, sirs, I believe in God." [...] "I admit," [...] said the atheistic champion, [...] "that it is a fine thing to see this God bending his brow to earth and watching with admiration the conduct of a Cato. But this notion is, like many others, very useful in some great heads, such as Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates, where it can only produce heroism, but it is the germ of all madnesses." [...] ROUSSEAU: [...] "Sirs, I leave the room if you say another word more," [...] and he was rising to fulfil his threat, when the entry of a new-comer stopped the discussion.[224] ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Sanchez {{received}} a standing ovation for performing Aretha Franklin's [...] "Respect" [...] on Showtime at the Apollo. The <b>hostess</b> Whoopi Goldberg <b>called</b> her back on stage to accept {{a second round of}} applause. Sanchez competed on the first season of America's Got Talent at the age of 11. Despite a successful audition, she was not seen on the show until the wild card round of the semi-finals when judge Brandy Norwood selected her to return for a chance to compete for the finals. Norwood predicted, [...] "You’re gonna be huge, I promise," [...] after seeing her perform [...] "I Surrender" [...] by Celine Dion. [...] The show's executive producer and former American Idol judge Simon Cowell named her [...] "one of the best I have ever heard." [...] On September 22, 2008, Sanchez sang [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] before a San Diego Chargers versus New York Jets National Football League matchup. She was invited to sing the national anthem again on September 27, 2009 before a Chargers versus Miami Dolphins matchup.|$|R
50|$|Today {{some cities}} still have clubs where female {{employees}} can be hired {{to dance with}} patrons. These clubs no longer use the ticket-a-dance system, but have time-clocks and punch-cards that allow the patron {{to pay for the}} dancer's time by the minute. The clock used by the cashier to determine the cost of time spent with a hostess is often set a few minutes later than the clock used to print the checkout time on the ticket, thus fraudulently increasing revenues for the establishment and hostess alike. Particularly accommodating hostesses often expect tips equivalent to the amount charged for their time. Some of these modern dance clubs exist in the same buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. The Dreamland club of Los Angeles was such an establishment. In the 1930s it was called Roseland Roof, and was owned by the Fenton brothers. When the Fenton brothers sold the club in 1981, the new buyers renamed the club to Dreamland, and continued taxi dancing in its original ballroom. These latter day establishments, including Starlight and Fantasy, are <b>called</b> <b>Hostess</b> Clubs.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Satterthwaite {{longs to}} return to the comforts of his London home, when the other guests spell out the results of their table-turning as QUIN {{followed}} by LAIDELL. He reverses his view, and <b>calls</b> <b>hostess</b> Madge Keeley to resurrect his invitation to Laidell, another house party in the country. Arriving at Laidell, he learns that Madge is soon to announce her engagement. She quietly points out Roger Graham to him at dinner. David Keeley, a brilliant mathematician but socially quiet man affectionately called the invisible man, is Madge's father. Among the guests are Roger's mother Mrs Graham, Doris Coles and Mabelle and Gerard Annesley. Mabelle strikes Satterthwaite as [...] "The Bird with the Broken Wing". He notices that Roger seems distracted, and later hears from Mabelle that earlier in the day she saw a figure in the woods who could only have been Mr Quin. Taking this as his cue to speak with her, he finds out that she is blissfully happy. Gerard fetches her to play for the group on her ukulele. The party breaks up for the night, heading to their respective rooms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah don't impugn my punctuality--it's my character!" [...] {{the useful}} lady protested, putting a sixpence from the cabman into her purse. Nick went off at {{this with a}} {{simplified}} farewell--went off foreseeing exactly what he found the next day, that the useful lady would have received orders not to budge from her <b>hostess's</b> side. He <b>called</b> on the morrow, late in the afternoon, and Julia saw him liberally, {{in the spirit of}} her assurance that she would be [...] "beautiful" [...] to him, that she had not thrown away his devotion; but Mrs. Gresham remained, with whatever delicacies of deprecation, a spectator of her liberality. Julia looked at him kindly, but her companion was more benignant still; so that what Nick did with his own eyes was not to appeal to her to see him a moment alone, but to solicit, in the name of this luxury, the second occupant of the drawing-room. Mrs. Gresham seemed to say, while Julia said so little, [...] "I understand, my poor friend, I know everything--she has told me only her side, but I'm so competent that I know yours too--and I enter into the whole thing deeply. But it would be as much as my place is worth to accommodate you." [...] Still, she didn't {{go so far as to}} give him an inkling of what he learned on the third day and what he had not gone so far as to suspect--that the two ladies had made rapid arrangements for a scheme of foreign travel. These arrangements had already been carried out when, at the door of the house in Great Stanhope Street, the announcement was made him that the subtle creatures had started that morning for Paris.|$|R
