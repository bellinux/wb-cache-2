40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>erect</b> sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting on the lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: <b>erect</b> sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting. Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> sitting, <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> sitting and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched pos-ture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure. [Conclusion] An <b>erect</b> posture can reduce changes in lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure compared to a slouched posture during cross-legged sitting...|$|R

5|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} regarding Issac Perrins' early life, {{but he was}} probably born in about 1751. His father, also called Isaac, worked for Boulton and Watt <b>erecting</b> stationary steam engines in the West Midlands {{until his death in}} 1780. In that year Isaac junior was offered work in Cornwall by the business but turned it down. He subsequently accepted a Birmingham-based job with the firm in 1782.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and <b>erecting</b> nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing walkways, <b>erecting</b> signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a fence around the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by <b>erecting</b> accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F.

He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G.

5|$|Boston honored Russell by <b>erecting</b> {{a statue}} of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is {{depicted}} in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} <b>erecting</b> the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E

The venture was financed by the minting of 10,000 gold dollars (depicted below) and 250,000 half dollars. The coins were minted and issued in 1922, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Grant's birth. Grant has also appeared on several U.S. postage stamps, the first one issued in 1890, five years after his death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few {{decades of the twentieth}} century, American {{paleontologist}} E. C. Case authored many studies on Dimetrodon and described several new species.

Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not been thoroughly described, as Cope was known for <b>erecting</b> new species on the basis of only a few bone fragments.|$|E

5|$|Many foreign {{visitors}} to Iran {{of the time}} had commented on their pitiful situation. Traveller A.V.W.

According to Edward Browne, the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of the Muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs. Zoroastrians were forbidden from <b>erecting</b> new houses and repairing old ones.|$|E
