50|$|As a {{very young}} man Victor Collin de Plancy studied in Paris at the Ecole de l'Immaculée Conception before gaining {{entrance}} to the prestigious École des Langues Orientales Vivantes, where he trained in Chinese, graduating in 1877. Though he had ambitions for entering the diplomatic corps, he was posted instead to Peking as a <b>junior</b> <b>interpreter,</b> often a preliminary step to seeking consular duties. Prevented by his stationing in Peking from taking the requisite exam for consular assignment (administered only at Paris), it was 1883 before he finally received his coveted consular position, when he was named consul second class at Peking. In 1884 {{he was promoted to}} acting French consul at Shanghai, where he served during the Sino-French War, distinguishing himself by services rendered to a cholera-stricken French fleet harbored in Shanghai during the conflict for which he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor. It was during this posting that Collin de Plancy served briefly as the first French consul to Korea, when relations were opened with that country in 1887. He would go on to serve as French consul in Japan before returning to Korea in 1896 as the resident French consul in that country. Except for extended sick leaves in 1899-1900 and 1905-1906, Collin de Plancy would spend the years from 1896 to 1906 in Seoul, where he would eventually be promoted full minister. He would serve only briefly as French minister to Bangkok in 1906 before requesting full retirement 1907.|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the main features}} of interaction in business settings based {{on the experience of}} the author, who dealt with this kind of work first as a free lance interpreter and then as a juniormanager for a decade, and was thus able to see the dynamics of this type of social interaction at play first as an external consultant and then as an employee. Understanding the virtual rules on which a specific type of interaction is based enables to know what to expect and this is precisely what <b>junior</b> <b>interpreters</b> need to know, in that: Knowledge of the negotiating styles adopted by different cultural groups is of paramount importance for successful interpreting. The interpreter must be familiar with these styles, which largely emerge through a combination of behaviors and only some of which are linguistic. (Gentile 1996 : 119 - 120...|$|R
50|$|From 1967 to 1968, Korchilov {{attended}} the United Nations Interpretation and Translation School in Moscow which {{earned him a}} certificate majoring in simultaneous interpretation. Later {{in the spring of}} 1968, Korchilov was sent to work as a <b>junior</b> conference <b>interpreter</b> at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. It was during this assignment that he interpreted during delicate summit meetings between the Heads of State and Government of the Soviet Union and the United States.|$|R
40|$|This {{is a brief}} {{outline of}} the history of {{interpreting}} in China. It describes and analyses the status, roles, and identities of interpreters in the diplomatic history of China up to the early 20 th century. The article aims to give a general introduction of the subject and to highlight points of interest for further enquiry, in a Chinese as well as other national contexts in which conditions may be different. Interpreting is far more intangible than translation, which can always refer to written records. Its history is therefore obscure. This is ironic: at important cross-roads in history, internationally and cross-culturally, there have always been interpreters. They have usually been anonymous, but their presence is sometimes mentioned in the records of a given nation and they have participated in making and, at the same time, have been witnesses to history. Since the earliest Chinese records, when <b>junior</b> <b>interpreters</b> had the title of ‘Tongue Men’, the status and acknowledgement of interpreters have developed tremendously. Some of the earliest historical records of meetings between Chinese and foreigners are dialogues, which, under scrutiny, suggests not only that interpreters were present for diplomatic exchanges, but also that they might have been used for recording history...|$|R
