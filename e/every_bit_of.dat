25|$|Because the P-array is 576 bits long, {{and the key}} bytes are XORed {{through all}} these 576 bits during the initialization, many {{implementations}} support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> every subkey depends on <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.|$|E

25|$|Miller, in one {{spirited}} over, {{altered the}} whole {{course of the}} game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton with his legs {{in front of the}} wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well {{under the control of the}} batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account.

25|$|A {{number of}} churches and other {{buildings}} in rural {{parts of the}} state are noted for their “folk baroque” architecture and decoration, especially in Atlixco and the southwest. Folk baroque consists of the use of tile and painted raised stucco based on more traditional Baroque designs, which was most popular in the 18th century. One well known church of this type is the church of Jolapan, which is modeled after the Tepalcingo Sanctuary in neighboring Morelos. The church of Jolalpan contains richly decorated pilasters, Solomonic columns and other elements in a design very similar to that of Tepalcingo. Between these {{there are a number of}} small churches which also show folk baroque influence such as those in Tlancualpican and Tzicatlán. The church in Tlancualpican is painted in bright blues, greens and red, with an ornate façade with sculpted leaves, tendrils and niches divided by spiral half-columns all done in stucco. Even more ornate is the church in Tzicatlán, which is a small rural farming village, with <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the surface of the main façade decorated with brightly colored images and sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. <b>Every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E

500|$|In December 1994, Antestor {{recorded}} {{their first}} full-length album titled Martyrium. Arctic Serenades Records was originally supposed to release that album, {{but because of}} unknown reasons that never happened, and the band tried to get another label to release the album. American-based label Morphine Records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of the album in 1997. In an interview, the drummer Armoth said: [...] "...we were in contact with a label called Morphine Records. But that was about signing a deal for the Martyrium album.

With the airfield lit by truck headlamps, Number 1 commanded by Giles was first to take off, a little after 6:00 local time, as dawn began to glow in the east. Next, LeMay's ship took off at 6:15am, 4:15pm Eastern War Time in Washington, with Lieutenant Colonel Kingsbury at the throttles and First Lieutenant Potts at the controls.

Time magazine described her as [...] "the perfect wife and motherpressing [...] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President's wife." [...] In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged 'Plastic Pat,' the derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial. Some observers described Pat Nixon as [...] "a paper doll, a Barbie dollplastic, antiseptic, unalive" [...] and that she [...] "has put <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, and she may no longer recognize it as such".|$|E
