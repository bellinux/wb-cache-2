5|$|In 1899 William Henry Pickering {{discovered}} Phoebe, {{a highly}} irregular satellite {{that does not}} rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do. Phoebe was the first such satellite found and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> {{than a year to}} orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.|$|E

However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{explicit}} introduction, the book depicts various fictional experts explaining matters in science, technology, and history in which critics {{have pointed out}} inaccuracies. An {{example of this is}} the antimatter discussions, wherein the book suggests that antimatter can be produced in useful and practical quantities and will be a limitless source of power. CERN published a FAQ page about Angels & Demons on their website stating that antimatter cannot be used as an energy source because creating <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> energy than it produces.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold {{hydrogen}} (20.3 K {{and slightly}} above) {{in order to}} reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.|$|E

25|$|Reduced {{mental and}} {{cognitive}} ability may afflict old age.Memory loss {{is common in}} old age due to the decrease in speed of information being encoded, stored, and retrieved. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> time to learn new information. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Its prevalence increases in old age from about 10% at age 65 to about 50% over age 85. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Demented behavior can include wandering, physical aggression, verbal outbursts, depression, and psychosis.|$|E
25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E

500|$|The Voigt-Kampff {{machine is}} a fictional {{interrogation}} tool, originating from the novel.

(Tyrell states: [...] "Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?") In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes [...] "six or seven" [...] questions to make a determination. In the film <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.|$|E

500|$|This rockfowl builds its nest {{onto the}} sides of rocks, {{normally}} in caves, where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within, or on nearly vertical cliff faces, which can be either bare or have some vegetation, though never woody branches, near the nest. Nests need to be built under an overhang {{to protect it from}} water, and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly. The nests are almost always found near water, which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools. These streams, particularly those located {{at the base of a}} nesting cliff, help keep predators away from the nests. Nests on rock surfaces are normally built [...] above the ground. In addition to the rock face nests, there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream. Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon's Lopé National Park. The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest's construction, and it can take two to three months to build one, though in some extreme cases <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> than a year. The nest itself is a half-cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in, often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest's walls. It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure. Nests are built at least away [...] from each other, and in some cases up to [...] The nest is normally [...] thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was [...] thick.
