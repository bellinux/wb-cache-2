50|$|ISO 6166 (or ISO6166:2013 {{as of the}} 2013 revision) {{defines the}} {{structure}} of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a <b>fungible</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
50|$|A National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, is {{a generic}} nine-digit alpha numeric code which {{identifies}} a <b>fungible</b> <b>security.</b> The NSIN is issued {{by a national}} numbering agency (NNA) designated for that country. Regional substitute NNAs have been allocated the task of functioning as NNAs in those countries where NNAs {{have not yet been}} established. NSINs are used as part of the makeup of a product's ISIN.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} tax rules for {{ownership}} of <b>fungible</b> <b>securities</b> {{in light of}} three recent cases addressing this issue, Samueli, Calloway, and Anschutz. We argue that ownership has no economic basis under an income tax because under a pure income tax ownership would not be needed to measure income. Rather than acting as a bedrock principle based in economics, ownership in a realization-based income tax acts as a default rule for assigning tax characteristics to positions. For example, ownership determine characteristics such as holding periods, eligibility for special tax benefits such as the dividends received deduction, counting toward control or as qualifying consideration for various purposes, and so forth. Each of these characteristics, which we label tax attributes, is motivated by different policy considerations. Given {{the wide variety of}} policies behind the various tax attributes, no single concept of ownership can be expected to be appropriate in all cases. Therefore, tax rules for each characteristic start with the default rule of ownership but modify the assignment of the attribute based on the relevant policy considerations. Viewing ownership, as a mere default for assigning tax attributes, we propose a simple and clear rule for ownership of <b>fungible</b> <b>securities</b> which produces results similar to those of current law and yet which avoid the problems created by the recent court decisions on ownership of <b>fungible</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R
50|$|OATs (Obligations assimilables du Trésor) are {{government}} bonds issued by Agence France Trésor (French Treasury), generally by auction {{according to an}} annual calendar published in advance. These <b>fungible</b> <b>securities</b> are issued with maturities of seven to 50 years, and have become the method of choice for placing the French government’s long-term debt.|$|R
50|$|Belgium {{has adopted}} {{fungibility}} for its domestic central securities depository, CIK, which {{was set up}} in 1967-1968. According to royal decree No. 62, issued on 10 November 1967, depositors of <b>fungible</b> <b>securities</b> have the rights of co-ownership. This change was fundamental to the development of Euroclear, by then beginning to process Eurobonds and build systems.|$|R
50|$|BTFs (Bons du Trésor à taux fixe et à intérêts précomptés) are fixed-rate {{short-term}} discount Treasury bills {{issued by}} the French debt agency Agence France Trésor (AFT). They are <b>fungible</b> <b>securities</b> whose original maturity is {{less than or equal}} to one year. BTFs are issued on a weekly basis by auction, according to a quarterly calendar published in advance specifying the maturity of bills to be auctioned. A 3-month BTF is issued each week, together with a semi-annual or annual BTF.|$|R
40|$|Liquidity {{fragmentation}} {{occurs when}} traders have choices in trading <b>fungible</b> <b>securities.</b> This article documents {{the migration of}} Dow futures’ liquidity from the pit to the electronic market. The implied spread declines dramatically for electronic trades as volume increases over a sample period from April 2002 through December 2004. This implicit cost, despite dwindling volume, does not increase for trades in the pit but drops by about $ 13 per trade. This somewhat surprising result suggests that competition for order flows brings about positive externality within the same exchange. Seller-initiated trades tend to have higher costs on both trading platforms. The implicit cost difference between a buyer-initiated trade and a seller-initiated trade is economically significant. Relative to the implied spread, the average difference is about 13 to 17 % for futures traded outside of the regular hours and 3. 4 to 12 % per trade during the regular hours of cash market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential benefits}} of security fungibility by conducting the first comprehensive analysis of Global bonds. Unlike other debt securities, Global bonds 2 ̆ 019 fungibility allows them to be placed simultaneously in bond markets around the world; they trade, clear and settle efficiently within as well as across markets. We test the impact of issuing these securities on firms 2 ̆ 019 cost of capital, issuing costs, liquidity and shareholder wealth. Using a sample of 230 Global bond issues by 94 companies from the U. S. and abroad over the period 1996 - 2003, we find that firms are able to lower their cost of (debt) capital by issuing these <b>fungible</b> <b>securities.</b> We also document that the stock price reaction to the announcement of Global bond issuance is positive and significant, while comparable domestic and Eurobond issues over the same time period are associated with insignificant changes in shareholder wealth...|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{reason for}} borrowing a security is {{to cover a}} short position. As you are obliged to deliver the security, {{you will have to}} borrow it. At the end of the agreement you will have to return an equivalent security to the lender. Equivalent in this context means <b>fungible,</b> i.e. the <b>securities</b> have to be completely interchangeable. Compare this with lending a ten euro note. You do not expect exactly the same note back, as any ten euro note will do.|$|R
