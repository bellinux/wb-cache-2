50|$|Exploration diamond {{drilling}} differs from other geological drilling (see Drilling rig) in that a solid core is extracted from depth, for examination on the surface. The key {{technology of the}} diamond drill is the actual <b>diamond</b> <b>bit</b> itself. It is composed of industrial diamonds set into a soft metallic matrix. As shown in the figure, the diamonds are scattered throughout the matrix, and the action relies on the matrix to slowly wear during the drilling, so as to expose more diamonds. The bit is mounted onto a drill stem, which is connected to a rotary drill. Water is injected into the drill pipe, so as to wash out the rock cuttings produced by the bit and also to reduce the heat produced due to friction which causes less wear and tear of the bits. An actual <b>diamond</b> <b>bit</b> is a complex affair, usually designed for a specific rock type, with many channels for washing.|$|E

Stone was loaded onto wagons and pulled by oxen to the nearby Northern Central Railway in Cockeysville until the quarry site itself was connected to the rail in 1866.

5000|$|Tools {{used to make}} {{marks in}} the glass include diamond point scribers, a {{flexible}} shaft power tool with a <b>diamond</b> <b>bit</b> and a sandblaster. Littleton Studios printer Sandy Willcox and her husband David Lewis, a painter, are credited with discovering that white lithograph ink is a versatile resist for sandblasting intaglio glass plates. They found that the viscous white ink, applied to the plate freely with a brush or evenly with a roller, can be drawn into by removing ink with wooden styluses, needles, or paintbrushes. When the drawing is complete, the plate is taken to the sandblasting booth wet. There, the initial onslaught of sand sticks to those areas of the image where ink remains (forming an even more resistant barrier) while etching {{those parts of the}} glass revealed by the hand of the artist. After the plate is cleaned of ink, the parts of the plate that received the blast can be seen to have minute pits that hold ink; the areas that were protected by the white litho ink remain smooth and are wiped clean before printing. Contact paper and tape are also used on the plates as a sandblasting resist; those materials create imagery with a hard-edged, stencil effect. Diluted hydrofluoric acid can be brushed onto the plate to create areas of very delicate tone.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of rock {{disintegration}} {{process at}} drilling, scanning of input quantities: thrust F, revolution n {{and the course}} of some output quantities: the drilling rate v and the power input P are needed for the control of this process. We can calculate the specific volume work of rock disintegration w and &# 981; - quotient of drilling rate v and the specific volume work of disintegration w from the presented quantities. Works on an expertimental stand showed that the correlation relationships between the input and output quantities can be found by scanning the accompanying sound of the drilling proces. Research of the rock disintegration with small-diameter diamond drill tools and different rock types is done at the Institute of Geotechnics. The aim {{of this research is}} the possibility of monitoring and controlling the rock disintegration process with the application of acoustic signal. The acoustic vibrations accompanying the drilling process are recorded by a microphone placed in a defined position in the acoustic space. The drilling device (drilling stand), the drilling tool and the rock are the source of sound. Two basic sound states exist in the drilling stand research : the noise at no-load running and the noise at the rotary drilling of rock. Suitable quantities for optimizing the rock disintegration process are searched by the study of the acoustic signal. The dominant frequencies that characterize the disintegration process for the given rock and tool are searched by the analysis of the acoustic signal. The analysis of dominant frequencies indicates the possibility of determining an optimal regime for the maximal drilling rate. Extreme of the specific disintegration energy is determinated by the dispersion of the dominant frequency. The scanned acoustic signal is processed by the Fourier transformation. The Fourier transformation facilitates the distribution of the general non-harmonic periodic process into harmonic components. The harmonic components can be used for the characterization of the rock disintegration process. The components of the acoustic signal by the classical monitoring and scanning of the acoustic signal can be found and specified, characterizing satisfactorily the disintegration process. The specification of the new quantities in the dependence on the thrust F and revolution n, derived from the acoustic signal by the Fourier transformation (as they enable the control of the rock disintegration process at drilling without the classical monitoring, i. e. without the scanning of thrust F and revolution n) is the aim of the research in the presence.

40|$|A fully {{instrumented}} laboratory {{drilling rig}} {{was designed and}} used to drill a variety of rock types with impregnated diamond microbits. The rocks, selected to represent {{a wide range of}} properties, were characterised by optical petrography and by the measurement of uniaxial compressive strength and relative abrasion resistance. A computer controlled electronic data logging system was used to record the power consumption, the rotational velocity, the bit thrust, the torque and the penetration rate. Tests were conducted under set thrust and under set rate of advance conditions to determine the effect of varying the bit pressure, rotational velocity, diamond mesh size and concentration, and rock type on the dependent drilling variables of diamond wear, bit wear, rock fracture, torque, power consumption, penetration rate and reactive load. The drilling efficiency was monitored by calculating the specific energy of drilling from the power consumption corrected for the power losses in the machine and from the generated torque, the latter being more sensitive. The diamond wear on a used bit was evaluated under the optical microscope by classifying each exposed stone into one of ten wear categories. The rock fracture was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy of the drilled surfaces, and by particle size distribution analysis of the drilling detritus. On the basis of the results a performance model for impregnated <b>diamond</b> <b>bit</b> drilling was formulated in which a critical stress threshold per actively drilling diamond must be exceeded for steady drilling to take place with any specific combination of bit and rock type. The optimum drilling thrust at which the specific energy is at a minimum and the penetration rate at a maximum for a given rock and bit configuration, occurs marginally above the thrust required for all the exposed diamonds to be in contact with the rock. The effective bit pressure and the rock type characteristics are crucial determinants for diamond wear type development and hence for the drilling performance within the operating range. The transition from suboptimal to optimal drilling conditions has been described in terms of the characteristic diamond wear, the specific energy, and the coefficient of friction between the bit and the rock. The mechanism of diamond wear and rock fracture are discussed with reference to the results of the optical and (ii)) scanning electron microscopy of worn diamonds and the rock detritus. It is concluded that a variety of rock properties affects the drilling performance, sometimes unpredictably and that the realistic drilling of any specific rock is necessary to determine its resistance to drilling. The necessary approach is demonstrated in detail for a single rock type, norite, for which it is shown the transition takes place at a pressure of approximately 400 MPa per actively drilling stone irrespective of the diamond size or concentration. A discussion of rock drillability testing demonstrates that experimental drilling with microbits has a valid role in the realistic evaluation of drillability and {{in the study of the}} complex fracture and wear mechanisms that must be understood for the application and rational design of appropriate bits...|$|E

However, little detailed research into the performance of impregnated bits has been conducted, and the capacity to predict their field behaviour is limited. As a contribution to the knowledge of impregnated bit performance, this project has studied basic relationships between thrust, rotational speed and the penetration of <b>diamond</b> <b>bits</b> into rock, with particular attention paid to the development of techniques suitable for laboratory testing using miniature impregnated bits. A conventional bench drill and a radial arm drill were modified and instrumented to enable operating conditions to be controlled and drilling parameters to be measured and monitored, for microscale and fullscale drilling using impregnated drill bits. Bit performance and drilling characteristics were studied for four rock types, and rock drillability studies were carried out on seven rock types. Statistical relationships between penetration rate, specific energy, torque and drilling distance that were determined enable projection of drilling data from a standard "sharp" condition. A wear measuring device was developed to assess matrix wear of the impregnated microbits. Reconditioning was done by drilling medium-strength, abrasive Stawell sandstone. Initial penetration rate increases linearly with increases in thrust and/or rotational speed, but only within a limited range, depending on rock type and the other operating parameters. Matrix contact with the rock surface, "clogging" of the diamonds, time-dependency, and strength of diamonds and the diamond-matrix bond play important roles in these phenomena. Comparison of rock drillability between that of microscale and fullscale bits shows a straight-line relationship indicating the possibility to predict drilling performance in the field.
