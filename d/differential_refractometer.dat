There are many detector types available {{and they can}} be divided into two main categories. The first is concentration sensitive detectors which includes UV absorption, <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer</b> (DRI) or refractive index (RI) detectors, infrared (IR) absorption and density detectors. The second category is molecular weight sensitive detectors, which include low angle light scattering detectors (LALLS) and multi angle light scattering (MALLS). [...] The resulting chromatogram is therefore a weight distribution of the polymer as a function of retention volume. The most sensitive detector is the differential UV photometer and the most common detector is the <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer</b> (DRI). When characterizing copolymer, it is necessary to have two detectors in series. [...] For accurate determinations of copolymer composition at least two of those detectors should be concentration detectors.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{absorption}} of dioxane, morpholine and piperidine from dilute aqueous olutions by Li-, Ca-, and Cu-montmorillonite {{is measured by}} means of a <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer.</b> This instru-ment measures small differences in the refractive indices of two liquids and provides a useful method for determining the amount of organic material removed from solution by the clay. Corrections are required for the effect of desorbed cations on the differential refraction measurements. Neutral molecules are absorbed in amounts related to the exchange capacity of the clay probably by cation-dipole interactions. The results are consistent with the formation of complexes Li+-R and R-Ca 2 +-R R 2 + 2 + for the three organic materials used; Cu ions behave like Ca ions for dioxane, but form> Cu 2 +-R R complexes with morpholine and piperidine. Under acid conditions, morpholine and piperidine form organic cations RH + which take part in cation exchange reactions and which are dominant at pH below about 5. Neutral molecule absorption also occurs by virtue of the presence of RH + ions on the clay which form RH+-R complexes (hemi-salt formation). When this last mechanism ofabsorption occurs, the total absorption is approximately twice that when a cation-dipole reaction or cation exchange alone operates.

This procedure solubilized the cellulose components directly without prior extraction or derivatization, processes {{that could lead to}} degradation of high molecular weight components. Stable cellulose solutions were obtained. The optimum dissolution conditions in the solvent system was highly dependent on the molecular weight, crystallinity and lignin content of each pulp cellulose sample. The molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of the pulp cellulose solutions were analyzed by {{size exclusion chromatography}}. A series of polystyrene standards were dissolved in the solvent and used as reference materials. The chromatographic data revealed whether depolymerization has taken place uniformly or non-uniformly during the pulp processing operations. The dilute solution intrinsic viscosity of the celluloses in N, N-dimethylacetamidelithium chloride solvent system was measured by capillary viscometry. Likewise, viscosity in cupriethylenediamine solution was analyzed. The measured viscosity values correlate well with the molecular weight data determined by size exclusion chromatography. The effect of acid hydrolysis on the molecular weight distribution pattern of cellulose was likewise studied. Results showed that each acid treatment provided different development of the molecular weight distribution curve, possibly due to the selectivity of hydrolytic attack on the cellulose components. The experimental data showed that dissolution in N,N-dimethylacetamide-lithium chloride solvent system and solution analysis by size exclusion chromatography can be a powerful tool in detecting differences among pulp cellulosic samples of widely different molecular weight and molecular weight distribution...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Elimination of {{flatulence}} is {{a challenging}} practical problem associated with consumption of legumes. The problem {{is compounded by}} the variability in susceptibility among individuals. Rackis (1981) established that the oligosaccharides-verbascose, stachyose and raffinose are major causes of flatulence. They escape digestion and are fermented by intestinal micro floral to form excessive amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Little has been done to develop bean varieties that combine agronomic superiority with nutritional quality, fast cooking and low flatulence levels in eastern Africa. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine if there is genotypic variation in concentration of oligosaccharides associated with flatulence in commercial bean varieties, recently released biofortified bean and advanced breeding lines, and (ii) the effect of cooking on oligosaccharide concentration. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study materials were 10 commercial dry bean varieties and seven recently released biofortified cultivars representing the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools and the major market classes grown in east, central and southern Africa. Verbascose, stachyose and raffinose were extracted twice from ground raw and cooked bean milks using a 3 : 7 v/v methanol-water mixture and quantified on a high performance chromatography system using analytical grade standard reagents. The oligosaccharides sugars were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography (Chromatography Systems model 750, Shimadzu, USA) with a <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer.</b> The precipitated material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant filtered prior to analysis. The column used (250 mm* 4. 6 mm i. d) was packed with spherisorb- 5 - amino, as a slurry in propan- 2 -ol. Sample injection valve, model 7120 was used. The eluting solvent was acetonitrile/water (67 : 33, v/v) with a flow rate of 2. 0 ml min- 1 at a temperature of 40 °C. Quantification was carried out by peak area comparisons of sample and standards of known concentration (Pinthong et al, 1980). Standards were obtained from SIGMA-Aldrich, USA.

40|$|Polyacrylamide {{is widely}} used as a {{flocculant}} but {{the influence of the}} molecular mass distribution upon flocculant activity is poorly understood. This thesis outlines the successful characterisation of ultrahigh molecular mass polyacrylamide solutions in terms of discrete solvated polymer coils and coil agglomerates. These features were correlated with the observed flocculation, demonstrating a number of solution state features required to improve flocculation activity. Aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide exhibit time-dependant behaviour affecting viscosity and polymer agglomeration. Improving the solvation of the polymer suppressed the agglomerates, as did manipulation of hydrogen bonding through the presence of salts. Limiting agglomeration through improved solvation apparently lowers a barrier to polymer interaction, such that the coils disperse but become more susceptible to reagglomeration under mild shear. These solvent modifications did not fully suppress the agglomerates. To fractionate polyacrylamide into a molecular mass distribution, flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF) was chosen, coupled to a multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) photometer and a <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer</b> for molecular mass and concentration sensitive detection, respectively. For the first time, the analysis of high molecular mass polyacrylamides in water using the flow FFF-MALLS technique has been reported. However, a number of difficulties needed to be overcome, including shear artefacts, sample agglomeration and polymer-membrane interactions. Both polyacrylamide standards and commercial flocculants were amenable to the technique. Commercial flocculants were found to vary not only with regard to viscosity and mean molecular mass, but also with sub- and supramicron size agglomerates. The flow FFF technique is size-sensitive, which for some low molecular mass samples displayed an ++unusually wide elution profile, in apparent conflict with the molecular mass sensitive MALLS detector. It was concluded that polyacrylamide in solution exists simultaneously in three states: discrete polymer coils, entanglements of a several coils, and agglomerates with supramicron diameters. This thesis concluded with a comparison between the characterised polyacrylamides and observed flocculation activity on a standard kaolin substrate. Results show polymer with supramicron agglomerates produce the largest and most shear-resistant kaolin aggregates with a definite optimum agitation intensity. Higher molecular mass flocculants with less agglomeration bind fine particles under more gentle conditions but are deficient under increasing stress. Flocculants exhibiting coil entanglements showed poor activity and formed only small aggregates. A modified flocculation mechanism was proposed, in which supramicron polymer agglomerates play a critical role...|$|E

40|$|Nesta tese, dois projetos distintos que usaram a técnica do Espalhamento de Luz foram desenvolvidos. Estudou-se a influência de soluções concentradas de uréia sobre agregados supra{{molecular}}es de anfifilicos (ASAś), através de condutimetria, supressão de fluorescência e espalhamento de luz. A uréia causou aumento da concentração micelar crítica (CMC) em todos os sistemas micelares estudados. A uréia diminuiu a seletividade da ligação iônica entre cloreto e brometo em micelas de haleto de cetil-trimetil-amônio, estudada através de supressão de fluorescência. Este aditivo causou também aumento na segunda CMC de brometo de tetradeciltrimetil- amônio (TTAB) e diminuição do peso molecular das micelas em bastão formadas. Concluiu-se, desta primeira parte, que a uréia tende a interferir nas transições de fase apresentadas em sistemas micelares, provavelmente através da combinação dos mecanismos direto e indireto. A uréia apresenta potencial para uso como aditivo para modulação das propriedades estruturais de sistemas micelares. Na segunda parte da tese desenvolveu-se um sistema, baseado em espalhamento de luz, capaz de monitorar o peso molecular de polímeros durante a polimerização. O sistema foi eficiente no monitoramento da polimerização da N-vinil-pirrolidinona, mostrando que o peso molecular do polímero formado é constante durante a maior parte da reação. As teorias atuais de cinética de polimerização não foram capazes de explicar esse comportamento. Light scattering techniques (static and dynamic) {{were used}} to detenninate the effect of urea on supramolecular aggregates and to monitor on-line molar mass ofpolymerization reactions. For {{the first set of}} investigation it was already established that urea increases the CMC and the dissociation degree (&# 945;) of ionic micelles (CTABr, TTABr, and SDS). From fluorescence suppression studies it was found that urea diminishes the ionic binding in zwitterionic and cationic micelles as well as in cationic vesicles. Bromide and chloride ionic selectivity in cationic micelles was found to nearly disappear in the presence of urea. Light scattering (static) detenninations showed that the weight averaged molecular weight (Mw) ofboth SDS and CTABr are invariant by the presence of the denaturant. A slight increase in the excluded volume tenn (A 2) was detected for CTABr in the presence of 3 M urea. In parallel both A 2 and the radius of gyration (&# 947;) of two polyelectrolytes (PAA and Hyaluronic acid) were not affected by the presence of urea. Sphere-to-rod concentration transitions (2 nd CMC) of TIABr micelles increased in the presence of urea and the MW of rod particles were observed to decrease. For the insoluble mixture of CTABr/Polystyrenesulfonate solubilization was achieved in the presence of 3 M urea. These set of results were explained {{as a result of the}} dual effect of urea, that is, the indirect effect by changing the properties of the solvent and the direct effect by solvating the hydrophilic domain of the aggregates and contributing with a stronger dipole moment. The second set of experiments was directed towards the real-time, on-line monitoring of Mw of polymerization reactions. This new approach could be succeeded by the coupling a light scattering detector, an UV photometer and a <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer</b> on line with a HPLC system. Mw growth formed in the polymerization of N-vynil-pirrolidone was accomplished with a small inherent error. Within the studied conditions Mw reached a plateau at early polymerization stages, after that only an increase in the number of polymer kinetic chains was observed. Current kinetic models were unable to predict the observed Mw growth pattern. This system is of great importance in basic and technological applications by virtue of its on-line capability...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 briefly {{introduces}} the theoretical {{background of the}} association and dissociation of polymer chains or colloidal particles are briefly introduced, including thermodynamic consideration and viscoelastic effect on the formation of mesoglobular phase in dilute polymer solutions, {{as well as some}} basic theories and universal models of fractal aggregates. Chapter 2 details the theories of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS) as well as the instrumental set-up. In addition, the invention and set-up of <b>differential</b> <b>refractometer</b> are briefly discussed. Chapter 3 summarizes laser light-scattering (LLS) and stopped-flow studies of association of cyclic- and linear-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (c-PNIPAM and l-PNIPAM) chains in dilute aqueous solutions. Dynamic and static LLS results reveal that the heating leads to a microphase transition. Resultant structures of interchain aggregates depend on the heating rate and the chain structure. In comparison with l-PNIPAM chains, a slow heating of c-PNIPAM chains in the solution results in stable mesoglobules with a lower average aggregation number, a looser structure and a smaller average size (∼ 290 nm). The temperature-jump induced association of c -PNIPAM chains in the stopped-flow measurement reveals two kinetic stages; namely, the loose packing of contracted c-PNIPAM chains and further contraction-induced fragmentation of initially packed c-PNIPAM chains {{due to the lack of}} interchain entanglements. On the other hand, for l-PNIPAM chains, the intrachain contraction and interchain penetration/entanglement simultaneously occur as the temperatures increases, leading to larger and more compact aggregates whose size increases with the solution temperature. Chapter 4 discusses the association of water-soluble PNIPAM-monolayer-protected gold particles in dilute dispersions induced by heating the dispersions to different final temperatures higher than the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM chains via the slow and fast processes. LLS was used to trace and characterize the association process, supplemented by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The slow heating-and-cooling cycle reveals that the association and dissociation of PNIPAM-protected gold nanoparticles can be easily induced by altering the solution temperatures and the association and dissociation are fully reversible. Fast heating the dispersion to three different temperatures reveals that both the aggregation rate and average aggregation number increase with the dispersion temperature. Furthermore, the fast heating leads to the formation of fractal aggregates. The fractal dimensions of such formed aggregates continuously increases as the time evolves, which can be ascribed to the simultaneous dissociation that leads to the restructuring and rearrangement of the aggregates, resulting in denser structures. It is interesting to note that the structure of aggregate always remains fractal during the whole process. Chapter 5 shows how water-dispersible nanosized semiconductor CdS particles (quantum dots, QDs) can be synthesized with a protective layer of covalently grafting linear thermally sensitive PNIPAM chains as well as how these CdS particles can be induced into reversible association and dissociation via an alteration of the dispersion temperature. The formation and fragmentation of these QDs aggregates were systematically investigated by laser light scattering (LLS) and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). There exists a hysteresis in one heating-and-cooling cycle. The CdS particles stabilized with shorter PNIPAM chains (Mn = 15, 000 g/mol) can associate to form larger and denser spherical aggregates with a much higher aggregation number than those grafted with longer PNIPAM chains (Mn = 31, 000 g/mol) in the heating process. The dissociation (fragmentation) in the cooling process has two stages: initially, the aggregates dissociate as the temperature decreases, and then, the fragmentation stops over a wider temperature range before its final complete dissociation at a lower temperature. We attribute such a two-stage fragmentation to a balanced effect of inter- and intra-chain hydrogen bonding as well as to the hydrophobic interaction between PNIPAM chains and CdS particles. In this Ph. D. thesis, temperature-induced association and dissociation of various polymeric systems were systematically investigated by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS), supplemented by other methods, such as stopped-flow temperature jump, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
