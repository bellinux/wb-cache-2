Players gain more points from defeating higher-ranked opponents, but will also lose more points if they lose to lower-ranked opponents. Players will gradually have their scores reset to 1000 if they do not play ELO mode for a few days. At the end of the week, 12 random players of the Top 100 receive a Collector card. 50 random players above 1200 points receive a random Rare card.
