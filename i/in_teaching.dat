5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836.

Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns <b>in</b> <b>teaching.</b>|$|E

5|$|Byard {{played with}} trumpeter Maynard Ferguson {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{and was a member}} of bands led by bassist Charles Mingus for several years, {{including}} on several studio and concert recordings.

In his 60-year career, Byard recorded at least 35 albums as leader, and more than 50 as a sideman. Byard's influence on the music comes from his combining of musical styles during performance, and his parallel career <b>in</b> <b>teaching.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki.

Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E
