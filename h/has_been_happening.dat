Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.|$|E

500|$|In {{the city}} of Brighton and Hove, on the English Channel coast of Southeast England, more than 40 former places of worship—many with {{considerable}} architectural or townscape merit—have been demolished, for reasons ranging from declining congregations {{to the use of}} unsafe building materials. [...] Brighton and Hove was granted city status in 2000 after being designated a unitary authority three years earlier through the merger of the fashionable, long-established seaside resort of Brighton and the mostly Victorian residential town of Hove. [...] In both towns, and in surrounding villages and suburbs, a wide range of Christian churches were established—mostly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] More than 150 of these survive (although not all are still in religious use), but demolition and the redevelopment of sites for residential and commercial use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> since the 1920s. [...] Postwar trends of declining church attendance and increasing demands for land accelerated the closure and destruction of church buildings: many demolitions were carried out in the 1950s and 1960s, and five churches were lost in 1965 alone. [...] Although most of these buildings dated from the urban area's strongest period of growth in the 19th century, some newer churches have also been lost: one survived just 20 years.|$|E
