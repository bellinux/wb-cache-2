In the nineteenth century, the industrial revolution enables rapid development of stock markets, driven by the significant capital requirements for finance industry and transport.

5000|$|In {{finance and}} {{financial}} law, dematerialization {{refers to the}} substitution of paper-form securities by book-entry securities. This {{is a form of}} indirect holding system where an intermediary, such as a broker or central securities depository, or the issuer itself (e.g French system) holds a record of the ownership of shares usually in electronic format. [...] The <b>dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> such as stocks has been a major trend since the late 1960s, with the result that by 2010 the majority of global securities were held in dematerialized form.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{phenomena}} of <b>dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> issued by large firms is mostly undertaken via Central Securities Depository, a national or regional institution holding the notary function, {{such as the}} Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the United States or Euroclear Group in part of the EU, which itself entrusts banks and investment firms to act as intermediaries between issuers and investors for the custody of these securities. Therefore, dematerialized securities are often referred as intermediated securities, in particular by the Unidroit convention on substantive rules for intermediated securities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underlying}} idea is that, while [...] "intrinsic law" [...] is intangible, {{since it}} is tributary to the legislation under which the issuer is incorporated, [...] "substantive law" [...] is, on the contrary, quite volatile, {{since it is}} subject to the place where the security is localised and/or traded. This distinction is ancient and draws back to the time where foreign investors used to repatriate paper securities subscribed with issuers incorporated under a different constituency. The title transfer of these securities (whether as a final transfer, or as a collateral) outside their constituency of origin could therefore be submitted to a law different from the law of the issuer: either the law convened by the parties (lex contractus), or, more often, the law of the place where the securities where located {{at the time of the}} transfer (lex rei sitae). Such distinction between [...] "intrinsic rights" [...] subject to issuer law and [...] "substantive rights" [...] subject either to the [...] "lex contractus" [...] or to the [...] "lex rei sitae", is still valid in the context of <b>dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and has been undertaken in the Hague Securities Convention concerning conflicts of laws, which in particular, provides for a [...] "lex contractus" [...] solution.|$|E

40|$|Until 2009. {{the holding}} and {{transfer}} of securities held through {{banks and other}} custodians were governed by traditional legal principles applying to movable,tangible property. But operational and commercial trends in the securities and custody business, such as the intermediation and <b>dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> had been challenging these legal foundations for quite some time. Swiss law {{had fallen out of}} step with fundamental changes in technologies and market practices and no longer provided a transparent and predictable framework. In line with extensive discussions in international forums, a consensus emerged in Switzerland that legal certainty must be improved without reducing the flexibility of market practices. On I January 2010, the Federal Intermediated Securities Act of 2008 entered into force simultaneously with the Hague Securities Convention of 2006. This commentary provides concise and comprehensive answers to issues arising in connection with the application of the FISA and the HSC.

The authors have paid particular attention to the application of the FISA and the HSC in the international cross-border context, since the holding of intermediated securities across national borders is of particular relevance for the Swiss context.

To do so, solutions are offered that also include services instead of just products, providing for the consumer a continuous relationship with the organization. Thus, in face of constant improvements in the provision of products and services to the consumer, this solution tends to be more appropriate, as a basic principle of quality.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the economic viability of the electronic warehouse receipt registry introduction, as a step toward electronic warehouse receipts. Both forms of warehouse receipt paper and electronic exist in practice, but paper warehouse receipts are more widespread. In this paper, the dematerialization process is analyzed in two steps. The first step is the <b>dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> warehouse receipt registry, with warehouse receipts still in paper form. The second step is the introduction of electronic warehouse receipts themselves. <b>Dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> warehouse receipts is more complex than that for financial <b>securities,</b> because <b>of</b> the individual characteristics of each warehouse receipt. As a consequence, electronic warehouse receipts are in place for only to a handful of commodities, namely cotton and a few grains. Nevertheless, the movement towards the electronic warehouse receipt, which began several decades ago with financial securities, is now taking hold in the agricultural sector. In this paper is analyzed Serbian electronic registry, since the Serbia is first country in EU with electronic warehouse receipts registry donated by FAO. Performed analysis shows the considerable impact of electronic warehouse receipts registry establishment on enhancing the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the system of public warehouses, and on advancing the trade with warehouse receipt...|$|R
40|$|This study {{constitutes}} the first critical history <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization.</b> Coined by critics Lucy Lippard and John Chandler in their 1968 essay, “The <b>Dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> Art,” this term was initially {{used to describe}} an emergent “ultra-conceptual” art that would render art objects obsolete by emphasizing the thinking process over material form. Lippard and Chandler believed dematerialization would thwart the commodification of art. Despite Lippard admitting in 1973 that art had not dematerialized into unmediated information or experience, the term has since entered art historians’ lexicons as a standard means to characterize Conceptual Art. While art historians have debated the implications <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization</b> and its actuality, {{they have yet to}} examine closely Lippard and Chandler’s foundational essay, which has been anthologized in truncated form. If dematerialization was not intrinsic to Conceptual Art, what was it? By closely analyzing “The <b>Dematerialization</b> <b>of</b> Art” and Lippard and Chandler’s other overlooked collaborative essays, this dissertation will shed light on the genealogy <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization</b> by contending they were not describing a trend limited to what is now considered Conceptual Art. By investigating the socio-historical connections <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization,</b> this dissertation will advance a more far-reaching view of the ideology <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization,</b> a cultural misrecognition that the world should be propelled toward immateriality that is located at the intersection of particle physics, environmental sustainability, science-fiction, neoliberal politics, and other discourses. This analysis then focuses on three case studies that examine singular works of art over a twenty-year period: Eva Hesse’s Laocoön (1966), James Turrell’s Skyspace I (1974), and Anish Kapoor’s 1000 Names (1979 - 85). In doing so, this dissertation will accomplish two objectives. First, it looks at how these works materially respond to the ideology <b>of</b> <b>dematerialization</b> and provide a means for charting how this cultural desire unfolds across space and time. Second, this dissertation contends that contrary to Lippard and Chandler’s prognostication, dematerialization—and immateriality—does not correlate to emancipation from capitalization. Rather, it will be shown that dematerialization, its rhetoric, and its strategies can actually be enlisted into the service of the commoditizing forces Lippard and Chandler hoped it would escape...|$|R
