50|$|In 2006 {{while doing}} pro bono {{work for the}} Institute for Justice and the Human Action Network, Martin {{represented}} a small business owner who sold caskets and <b>funeral</b> <b>supplies</b> at discounted prices. In an effort to regulate abuses in the funeral business, the State of Missouri required vendors of caskets to have a funeral director's license. Martin and other attorneys argued {{that the government should}} not prevent the businessman from selling caskets at a discount and helping people avoid inflated costs of purchasing a casket from funeral homes. Eventually, the State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors sided with the small business owner.|$|E

5000|$|Grierson of Lag was a byword for evil {{among the}} common Presbyterian folk in Annandale, who gravely {{asserted}} that he, {{like the other}} persecutors of the Covenanters, had intimate dealings with the devil, {{and that he was}} [...] "partly in hell" [...] before his death, in evidence of which they told that his saliva burnt holes where it fell, and his feet put into cold water made it boil. Lag died, aged 77, at his town house in Dumfries on 31 December 1733, and was buried two days later in the Grierson family burial plot in Old Dunscore Churchyard, the cost of the funeral being £240 Scots. A story was told that on the night he died a chariot surrounded by thunder clouds swept his soul away to hell. Another described how the horses pulling his hearse to Dunscore churchyard died of exhaustion on the way and a black raven flew down and settled on the coffin, flying away only at the moment of burial. The antiquary Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe claimed that the story regarding the horses was in fact true, and that his grand-uncle Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, a nephew of Lag's, had both attended the <b>funeral</b> and <b>supplied</b> the horses which subsequently died. Whereas the Presbyterian martyrologists had listed the names of those shot at the hands of Lag's men, the tales that grew up after his death became more lurid, and in later years locals pointed out a spot on Halliday Hill, near Lag Tower, where the Laird was said to have rolled Covenanters downhill in a barrel filled with spikes.|$|R
40|$|The case of {{the funeral}} market offers privileged {{insights}} into the way market devices closely link politics and markets. The talk will first {{go back to the}} formation of the French funeral market {{at the beginning of the}} 19 th century, in the context of constant interference by Church, State and the first Pompes Funèbres (a service profession whose function was to organize <b>funerals)</b> in the <b>supply</b> of <b>funeral</b> goods and services. The 'system of the classes' appears here as a central device in managing dissonance between conflicting values. A historical jump then leads us to the contemporary stage, with the significant reduction of the state's involvement in funeral provision, in favour of a liberalized and competitive market and the exponential development of death insurance. In both periods, the analysis will stress the role of market devices in the implementation of a politics of value through a 'calculation formula', which confers on the devices a capacity for addressing and combining social values - e. g. the desire for ostentatious funerals in the 19 th century, or the 'intimization' of death - with political concerns - e. g. the dividing line between public and private, or the question of how solidarity, as an expression of a common humanity, might be achieved through the rituals surrounding burial...|$|R
