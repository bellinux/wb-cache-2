5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in <b>davits</b> alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 August 1942, Colhoun ported at Kukum Point and {{unloaded}} stores for the U.S. Marine Corps garrison on Guadalcanal, and then exited the harbor to undertake anti-submarine patrols. Just before 12:00, an air raid siren was issued and Colhoun moved out to sea. A second alert was received at 14:00. Shortly thereafter, a lookout spotted a formation of Japanese aircraft approaching using the sun as cover. The Japanese aircraft, using clouds as cover, dove and released three bombs against Colhoun, two splashing nearby and one striking the after searchlight platform and a nearby boat. The bomb blew the after <b>davits</b> down and forward, blocking the after engine room hatches, and starting a fire from the diesel oil spilled by the boat.|$|E

5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on <b>davits,</b> 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the <b>davits</b> for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the <b>davits</b> jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E
25|$|A {{more obvious}} {{external}} change was the fitting of large crane-like <b>davits,</b> each powered by {{an electric motor}} and capable of launching six lifeboats which were housed in gantries; the ship was originally designed to have eight sets of gantry <b>davits</b> but only five were actually installed before she entered war service, with the difference being made up with boats launched by manually-operated Welin-type <b>davits</b> as on Titanic and Olympic.|$|E

25|$|Both cutters {{were kept}} swung out, {{hanging from the}} <b>davits,</b> ready for {{immediate}} use, while collapsible lifeboatsC and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to <b>davits)</b> immediately inboard of boats1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters, on either side of number1 funnel. There were no <b>davits</b> to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand. Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from <b>davits</b> supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the <b>davits,</b> ready to be launched. The <b>davits</b> were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The <b>davits</b> aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the <b>davits.</b> Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E
25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The transport area or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty power-operated <b>davits.</b> Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin <b>davits</b> – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier <b>davits</b> were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with luffing <b>davits</b> of a crossbeam type. The <b>davits</b> themselves provided a demarcation between the responsibilities of the LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA Flotilla.|$|E

25|$|The White Rock Boat Club {{was formed}} in 1961 as the brainchild of {{three members of the}} Corinthian Sailing Club. CSC was having a problem with {{tracking}} davit ownership and the price of <b>davits</b> escalated due to demand since the club had no control over prices. Two of the founders, the Oetkings, had also developed a fine catamaran called the Hellcat and had gone into production with growing sales, but they couldn't find <b>davits</b> at CSC. WRBC was constructed not only to supply reasonably priced <b>davits,</b> but to help sell Hellcats. The club sold <b>davits</b> {{to help pay for the}} construction of the club, with the provision that the club could buy the davit back if the owner left the club. The club has exercised this right and now owns and leases most of its <b>davits.</b> The club was constructed with a few differences from its present configuration as can be seen in the 1968 photo above. In order to promote organized class sailing, WRBC at one time limited the type of boats kept at the club to racing classes. In the 1970s, the following classes of sailboats were eligible for membership: Butterfly, Coronado 15, Flying Scot, Harpoon, Lido, Lone Star 13, MC Scow, M16 Scow, M20 Scow and Rebel. The club remains active on the lake today.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{lifeboats}} {{could be}} stored {{within reach of}} the <b>davits</b> on the deck house roof, and in an emergency the gantry <b>davits</b> could reach lifeboats {{on the other side}} of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. The aim of this design was to enable all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. However, several of these <b>davits</b> were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The ship carried 48 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.|$|E
25|$|In summer 2016, {{observers}} {{noted that}} the ship's lifeboats were lowered and stored on a nearby parking lot, and the lifeboat <b>davits</b> were removed.|$|E
