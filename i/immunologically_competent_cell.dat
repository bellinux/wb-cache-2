40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the lesions of {{delayed hypersensitivity}} is obscure, {{in part because}} the cell type or types which can mediate the reaction are unknown. Lymphoid cells are thought to be carriers of this type of immunologic information, although recently conventional antibody of high affinity has been proposed as the mediator (1) and additional reports have supported the proposal (2, 3). The small lymphocyte has been advocated as the <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cell,</b> capable of antibody formation and homograft destruction (4, 5). Since thoracic duct lymph contains a high proportion of small lymphocytes, a number of recent investigations has used the lymph for immunologic studies. Wessl 6 n described the transfer of delayed hypersensitivity by thoracic duct cells but he did not determine whether the small lymphocyte or other cell types were the responsible agents (6). Gowans and his colleagues transferred relatively "pure " populations of thoracic duct small lymphocytes to destroy long standing homografts, a process considered to be similar to that of delayed hypersensitivity (4) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{regional}} lymph nodes draining tumors and also nonregional lymph nodes {{have been studied}} at the light- and electron-microscopic levels. These nodes were obtained from rats bearing long-evolving autochthonous breast cancers. They were compared with a control group of the same age. A morphometric quantitative analysis was done to evaluate <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> populations. In the experimental group {{there were no differences}} between regional and distal lymph nodes in the tumor challenge. However, when the experimental group was compared with the control group, differences appeared. The changes involved were diminution of the paracortical area with stimulation of plasma cells in the medullary cords. Ultrastructurally, in lymph nodes of the experimental group there were lymphoblasts in the paracortex and germinal centers, suggesting active lymphopoiesis. In addition, many plasma cells showed morphologic evidence of involution or other alterations. It is suggested that regional and distal lymph nodes have similar morphologic behavior when the tumor grows {{for a long period of}} time, a finding that contributes to our knowledge of the systemic implications of the lymphatic system...|$|E

40|$|Antibody {{synthesis}} {{in vitro}} {{has been studied}} wtth <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> of lymphoid tissue in radioactive culture medium. Specific antibody proteins have been isolated and characterized from such a system. However, non-specific radioactive proteins which coprectpitated with heterologous precipitates were {{also found in the}} culture medium (Ketson and Katchen, 1956; Wolf and Stavitsky, 1958; Stavitsky 1958, 1960, 1961; Dutton et al., 1958; Askonas and Humphrey, 1958; Vaughan et al., 1960; Bussard and Huynh, 1960; and Thorbecke, 1960). The so-called non-specific proteins were produced by normal and <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> cells; they had the capacity to absorb to antigen-antibody complexes and were found in the alpha and beta globulin protein fractions. These properties suggested that such non-specific proteins might be complement. In this laboratory, non-specific coprecipitating proteins were also found to be present in culture medium in which <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> were Incubated. This observation,as well as those previously mentioned, initiated this investigation in order {{to determine whether or not}} these non-specific proteins were identlcal with complement and also to identify the tissues concerned with the synthesis.

40|$|WOODRUFF AND SYMES (1962) {{were able}} to retard the growth of mouse mammary {{carcinoma}} transplants, in isogenic hosts, by administration of sublethal whole body irradiation followed by injection of allogeneic <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b> The irradiation was given to facilitate {{the survival of the}} injected cells which were obtained either from normal donors, or animals pre-immunized against the tumour to be treated. Pre-immunized cells were therapeutically more effective. The use of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> in the treatment of leukaemia transplants in isogenic mice has been reported by Alexander, Connell and Mikulska (1966). They found {{that it was possible to}} destroy tumours by treatment, two days after transplantation, using spleen cells from immunized allogeneic donors. However, it was necessary to inject spleen cells in a ratio of 200 to every 1 lymphoma cell, estimated to be present. It was hoped that after giving immunosuppressive therapy with Melphalan (L-phenylalanine mustard), as a prelude to allogeneic spleen cell injection, a lesse...|$|R
40|$|When normal mouse spleen, {{cells in}} {{suspension}} are cultured in vitro {{in the presence}} of polymer from S. adelaide flagellin, an immune response can be obtained as measured at the level of single antibody-forming cells. Cultures were stimulated with different doses of antigen, ranging from 0. 2 ng to 3 µg/ml of tissue culture fluid and {{it was found that the}} peak number of approximately 500 antibody-forming cells per 106 harvested cells by day 4 was antigen dose dependent, 2 – 20 ng/ml being the optimal concentration. When more than 1 µg/ml of polymer from S. adelaide together with either 20 ng/ml of polymer from S. waycross or with 4 x 106 sheep erythrocytes were placed in the system, unresponsiveness to S. adelaide, but immunity to the other antigens occurred simultaneously. Cells made immunologically tolerant in vitro to S. adelaide H antigens were transferred into syngeneic lethally irradiated recipients and challenged with the same antigen. The adoptive immune capacity in these mice, as measured at the level of the <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> was reduced by 80 – 90 % as compared with relevant controls. Attempts to induce low zone tolerance in vitro were without success. To study the kinetics of tolerance induction in vitro, cells were cultured with tolerogenic doses of antigen for various periods of time, washed, and subsequently cultured with immunogenic doses of antigen for 4 days. It was found, that immunological tolerance may be induced to a significant degree in vitro within a period of 15 min. Similar results were obtained when spleen cells were exposed for various lengths of time to tolerogenic doses of antigen but at a temperature of 4 °C instead of 37 °C. The results are taken as suggestive evidence that the initial step in tolerance induction is related to the direct interaction between the surface of immune competent cells and antigen molecules...|$|E
40|$|Rat {{bone marrow}} is {{deficient}} in <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> {{when compared with}} the peripheral pool of circulating small lymphocytes. However, circulating lymphocytes capable of initiating a lethal graft vs. host reaction can develop from myeloid precursors. In adult rats inoculated at birth with parental strain bone marrow cells, the thoracic duct lymph contains cells having the immunological capability of the marrow donor. The evidence suggests that <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> lymphocytes derive from cells normally resident in bone marrow and probably not from precursors in the peripheral lymphocyte pool...|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (SCT), {{which is being}} used increasingly day by day; is a treatment method {{for the management of}} mainly lymphohematopoietic diseases and also immunological and metabolic disorders. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a complicated clinical syndrome involving a severe immune reaction mediated by <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells,</b> mainly T lymphocytes, resulting in organ dysfunction. It is accepted as the most important cause of mortality and morbidity following SCT. GVHD has also resulted from transfusion of nonirradiated blood products, from maternal-fetal transfusions and following solid organ transplants.

40|$|The {{transplantation}} of spleen {{cells from}} old NZB/Bl mice with renal disease induced both the structural and the functional changes of membranous glomerulonephritis in young NZB/Bl mice {{within a few}} weeks and well in advance of its usual spontaneous occurrence. The development of hypergammaglobulinemia and lymphoid cell hyperplasia in the young mice indicated that <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells,</b> derived from either the transplant or the recipient, proliferated during this process. These experiments, together with other findings, provide further support for the view that membranous glomerulonephritis in NZB/Bl mice is produced by immunological, and probably autoimmune, mechanisms and that the renal disease is apparently almost wholly unrelated to the hemolytic process...|$|R
40|$|Immunologically {{immature}} {{and mature}} Arbor Acre White Rock fowls were splenectomized and precipitin production after a single inoculation of bovine serum albumin was assayed. Fowls splenectomized at 4, 9 or 17 weeks of age were intravenously injected at 6, 12, 20 weeks; a subcutaneous or intravenous inoculation {{was given to}} 12 -week-old birds splenectomized at 8 weeks. The splenectomized animals showed a delayed antibody appearance and a later day of peak titre. Only the animals which were splenectomized at 17 weeks showed a depression. These results suggest that {{a greater number of}} <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> are present in the spleen and that non-splenic tissue of young animals only can compensate for the removal of this organ...|$|R
40|$|Four Lf fluid {{diphtheria}} toxoid were injected intracutaneously, together with tuberculin PPD, into guinea-pigs sensitized to tuberculin by a water-in-oil emulsion of killed tubercle bacilli 4 – 5 months previously. Antibody production, judged by antibody levels at 4 weeks, was {{two to four}} times greater than that in control guinea-pigs. Such an increase in antitoxin would correspond to a ten- to twelve-fold increase in the effective dose of toxoid, which {{is much greater than}} any likely non-specific retention at the injection site. It is suggested that the effect of a local tuberculin reaction in enhancing the immunogenic capacity of {{diphtheria toxoid}} is due to {{an increase in the number}} of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> to which the toxoid has access...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> in the organ-cultured mouse fetal thymic rudiment has been investigated. Fetal thymuses removed at 14 d of gestation and cultured for 7 - 21 d were assayed for their content of cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-P) directed against H- 2 d alloantigens. Whereas CTL-P were undetectable within fetal thymus until 18 - 19 d of gestation, their frequency in the organ- cultured fetal thymus was similar to, {{or greater than}} that found in the normal adult thymus. This direct demonstration of the {{appearance of}} alloreactive CTL-P in a closed in vitro system should provide an accessible model for the investigation of interactions between developing T cells and the thymic microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is characterised by {{variations}} in the absolute and relative concentrations of the hormones of the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis, which in turn affect cell function and cytokine and heat shock protein production. Menstruation involves the shedding of the secretory endometrium, {{which is part of}} the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue and hence is rich in <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> such as CD 8 T cells and macrophages. The case is reported here of a patient presenting with a recurrent but transient symmetrical inflammatory polyarthritis which only occurred at menstruation with no residual damage. The disease was suppressed by danazol. Endometrial degradation products are suggested as the trigger of this 'menstrual arthritis'...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} small {{lymphocytes}} to cause graft vs. host reactions in rodents demonstrates that cells {{of this type}} are <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> (1). However, no informarion is provided {{about the origin of}} small lymphocytes or the stage at which they, or their precursors, acquire the ability to initiate immunological responses. Experiments using irradiated mice indicate that <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> can develop from precursors in adult bone marrow. Injections of bone marrow cells can save the lives of mice exposed to a lethal dose of whole body X- or ~/-irradiation (2, 3). Cells from donor marrow correct the immunological deficiency in such animals ff they have either an intact thymus or thymus gralt (4, 5). Similarly, cells from a variety of tissues, including bone marrow, can contribute <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> to spleen and lymph nodes of sublethally irradiated mice by a thymus-dependent mechanism (6 [...] 9). The results suggest that marrow contains progenitors of immunologieally competent ceils but it cannot be concluded that the <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> axe small lymphocytes.

40|$|The {{responses}} of conventional and germ-free mice thymectomized at birth to sheep erythrocytes and to skin homografts have been investigated. Antibody production to sheep erythrocytes was depressed to an equal extent in thymectomized germ-free and conventional mice. Skin graft rejection in thymectomized germ-free mice was impaired {{in some cases}} although {{the extent of the}} impairment was generally not as extreme as it was in thymectomized conventional mice. The implications of the results are discussed. It is concluded that a primary consequence of thymectomy is some degree of immunological impairment but that other factors operating in the conventional state, such as bacterial contamination, endotoxins and cross-reacting antigens, act to reduce even further the number of antigen-reactive cells available in an already limited pool of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{these studies}} adult mice treated with {{cyclophosphamide}} and foreign <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> developed a graft versus host disease which outwardly resembled that encountered in other experimental systems. Progressively larger doses of cyclophosphamide produced an increasingly severe disease whereas comparable doses of mechlorethamine were ineffective. Increasingly larger cell inocula from parental, allogeneic, and xenogeneic donors {{resulted in a}} correspondingly more severe disease. Nucleated cells obtained from the peripheral blood {{were found to be}} the most potent inducers of this syndrome, while cells from the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus displayed lesser degrees of reactivity in that order.

40|$|In {{a primary}} {{immunological}} response in vivo, antigen seems to stimulate <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> to proliferate and to produce progeny cells {{which can make}} specific antibody. It {{has been suggested that}} the dose of antigen regulates the rate of division of <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> (1 - 4), 1 but the evidence for this has not been conclusive. The present study provides evidence of proliferation of plaque-forming cells. Spleen cells from mice ~mmunized with different doses of sheep erythrocytes were pulse-labeled in vitro with tritiated thymidine and analyzed by a radioautographic modification of the Jerne-Nordin (S) plaque technique. Spleens from mice inoculated with high doses of antigenic sheep red cells yielded higher percentages of labeled plaque-forming cells than spleens from mice inoculated with low doses of antigen. The results support the hypothesis that antigen stimulates specific immunocompetent cells to divide and that the rate of division is dependent on the dose of antigen. Materials and Method...|$|R
40|$|In vitro rubella virus infections of {{lymphocytes}} {{from normal}} adult humans impaired their responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulations; a situation which seemed {{analogous to the}} PHA unresponsiveness of peripheral lymphocytes from babies with the congenital rubella syndrome. Such in vitro viral infection of normal cells also decreased the synthesis of normal nucleic acids and structural proteins, and abrogated the enhanced DNA synthesis induced by pokeweed and specific antigen stimulations. Furthermore, it was shown that live rubella virus, but not ultraviolet-irradiated virus, was necessary for the impaired mitogenic responses of normal leukocytes. These observations are interpreted to favor {{the view that the}} virus achieves its inhibitory effect on the action of mitogens by interference either directly or indirectly at an intracellular site. Such an action could reduce the functional potential of lymphocytes and impair their effectiveness as <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> or as effectors in immunologic reactions...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{improved}} tissue culture techniques the study of animal viruses has made rapid progress. The effect of a virus infection on the host cells has been studied from many aspects. One aspect is the alteration of the protein synthetic capacities of the infected cells.

40|$|Mature <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> {{dendritic}} <b>cells</b> are {{the most}} efficient antigen-presenting cells that powerfully activate T cells and initiate and sustain immune responses. Indeed, dendritic cells are able to efficiently capture antigens, express high levels of costimulatory molecules, and produce the combination of cytokines required to create a powerful immune response. They are also considered {{to be important in}} initiating autoimmune disease by efficiently presenting autoantigens to self-reactive T cells that, in this case, will mount a pathogenic autoimmune reaction. Triggering T cells is not a simple on–off procedure, as T cell receptor responds to minor changes in ligand with gradations of T cell activation and effector functions. These “misfit” peptides have been called Altered Peptide Ligands, and have been shown to have important biological significance. Here, we show that fully capable dendritic cells may present, upon natural antigen processing, a self-epitope with Altered Peptide Ligands features that can unexpectedly induce anergy in a human autoreactive T cell clone. These results indicate that presentation of a self-epitope by <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> dendritic <b>cells</b> does not always mean “danger” and show a mechanism involved in the fine balance between activation and tolerance induction in humans...|$|R
40|$|WOODRUFF and Symes (1962 a) {{reported}} that the growth of subcutaneous mouse mammary carcinoma transplants, in isogenic hosts, could be retarded by the administration of sub-lethal whole body irradiation followed by intravenous injection of allogeneic <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b> Destruction of the tumour, however, could only be achieved {{at the expense of}} killing the host through the effects of concomitant graft-versus-host disease. It therefore seemed desirable to seek methods whereby the graft-versus-host reaction could be reduced whilst retaining or increasing the graft-versus-tumour effect. With this in mind, Woodruff, Symes and Boak (unpublished) repeated the experiments cited above with the difference that allogeneic cells were injected intraperitoneally in the treatment of intraperitoneal tumour transplants. The result of this immediate intimate contact between the donor spleen and tumour cells was a significant prolongation of host survival with minimal graft-versus-host disease; however, no animals were " cured ".

40|$|Polyarthritis and cardiac lesions {{have been}} {{observed}} in the adult rat with homologous disease. Changes in the lymphoid tissue and kidney have also been noted. A migratory polyarthritis occurred in {{over half of the}} affected animals, and cardiac involvement of varying intensity was present in all. Histologically, the arthritis was characterized by a mononuclear synovial inflammatory reaction. In the heart, the valves and myocardium demonstrated a similar type of response. Cultures of involved joints and hearts for pyogens and pleuropneumonia-like organisms were negative. The lymphoid tissues showed progressive changes in three stages: (a) disappearance of follicles; (b) increase in plasma-like cells and histiocytes; and (c) fibrosis. The second stage tended to coincide with the development of the polyarthritis. The kidney showed mild interstitial mononuclear infiltration. The pathologic changes described appear to be a consequence of reaction between foreign <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> and host antigens, but the possibility that these lesions represent a response to antigens derived from unknown infectious agents is, however, not ruled out...|$|R
40|$|T HE SENSITIVITY OF LYMPHOCYTES to {{irradiation}} {{provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} extracorporeal irradiation (ECI) of the circulating blood to destroy lymphocytes selectively.

These studies 1 established the basic feasibility and effectiveness of ECI in reducing the number of circulating lymphocytes and destroying <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b> A logical exten-sion of these studies was the application of ECI to treatment of hematologic disorders manifest by increased numbers of abnormal cells in the circulating blood.

Eleven of the failed heterograft aortic valves were examined at intervals of from 2 to 32 months after insertion. Fourteen control pig aortic valves were also examined. Electron microscopy was performed on two of the failed heterograft valves and three control pig valves. Failure of the heterograft was due to stretching and deformation of the cusps with resultant valvular incompetence. Stretching of the cusp was a result of reduction in the amount of its collagen content. The elastic tissue appeared little altered. A microscopic layer of fibrin thrombus was present on the surface of 8 of the 11 valves. Only 2 of the 11 valves showed invasion of the graft by <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b> No valve showed any sign of infection or calcification.

The genetic disparity between strains of the H_ 2 b and H_ 2 d genotypes favors the greater responsiveness of the C 51 BL/De. The graft-versus-host reactions produced in (C 51 BL/Ka X DBA/ 2) F 1 recipients by C 51 BL/De and DBA/- 2 eB marrow were similar and only slightly more severe than the reaction of DBA/ 2 marrow.

40|$|The {{intracutaneous}} inoculation of {{lymph node}} cell suspensions from normal hamsters into normal, homologous hosts causes {{the development of}} delayed inflammatory reactions, normal lymphocyte transfer (NLT) reactions, the intensities of which reflect the antigenic disparity between donor and recipient. The immunogenetic situations in which they occur indicate that these reactions are due to sensitization in situ {{on the part of}} inoculated <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> against alien antigens of the host. They are graft versus host reactions. If hamsters are sensitized by cellular or solid tissue homografts and then challenged intracutaneously with lymphoid or epidermal cells from the donor strain, direct reactions are provoked. A positive correlation exists between the development of transplantation immunity and the capacity to give direct reactions. The sensitivity responsible for direct reactions can be suppressed by irradiation or administration of cortisone, and it is transferable by means of viable lymphoid tissues or cells but not by means of serum. Intracutaneous inoculation of viable node or splenic cells from specifically sensitized hamsters into hosts of the donor strain incites transfer reactions, the intensities of which depend upon the number of cells transferred and the level of sensitivity in the animal that provided them. These reactions are not incitable by thymocytes, by killed lymphoid cells, or by serum. Transfer reactions differ from NLT reactions only on a quantitative and chronologic basis. However, a sharp experimental distinction can be drawn between them. For example, if normal MHA node cells and node cells from MHA hamsters sensitized against CB antigens are injected into the skins of MHA's tolerant of CB tissue, only the sensitized cells incite reactions. Both direct and transfer reactions are highly specific immunologically. The inability of node cells to incite NLT or transfer reactions in heavily irradiated hosts and other findings sustain the thesis that it is host cells of hematologic origin, rather than indigenous skin cells, that contribute the antigenic stimulus required for these reactions. All the findings presented are consistent with the hypothesis that the various delayed inflammatory reactions described are manifestations of immunological responses on the part of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> against alien transplantation antigens...|$|R
40|$|A reductionist {{approach}} {{is commonly used}} to gain insight into complex biological systems: individual components of the system are isolated so that the contribution of each individual element can be studied in detail. Dissection {{of the events that}} control blood clotting (1) or complement activation (2, 3) are examples of the successful use of this approach. We have tried to use this approach to understand the highly complex system of immunoregulation. Our strategy has depended on the demonstration that the genetic program of many <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> combines information for function (reflected by the synthesis of biologically active proteins by the cells) with the expression of an unique pattern of surface glycoproteins (4).

40|$|An {{autoimmune}} mechanism {{has been}} invoked {{in a number}} of disease states, such as the connective tissue diseases (1, 2), chronic thyroiditis (3, 4), hemolytic anemia (5), and other conditions (6).

Regardless of the mechanism whereby such abnormally reactive cells may arise, it is possible to study the consequences of their presence by providing the experimental animal with <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> capable of reacting with antigens of the new host. This experimental situation is achieved in the animal with homologous disease, in which there is immunologic interaction between homologous lymphoid cells and host antigens.

The increase of the number of reactive cells in such systems after immunization (4 - 10) and the specific inhibition of the reactions by blocking antigen (7, 8) indicate that lymphoidal cells can display antibody activity on their surfaces.

It is suggested that micro-organisms causing localized infections of the gastrointestinal tract stimulate immunoglobulin A producing sites of the intestinal wall. This results in rapid production of secretory antibody. In the course of this localized infection, replication of bacteria in the lymphoid tissue of the intestinal wall stimulate <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> in direct proximity to the alimentary tract, causing increased serum IgA levels. The presence of immunoglobulin A and M in th...|$|R

Nonetheless, the functional relationship between proliferation and antibody synthesis is ill-defined, even though both activities occur in the same cell (2). It has been proposed that antigen stimulates a small clone of <b>immunologically</b> <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> both to synthesize antibody and to divide rapidly, producing large numbers of antibodyforming cells within a few days. Support for this hypothesis has been obtained from data showing that, following immunization of mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), the number of splenic plaque-formlng cells (PFC) doubles every 7 hr during the exponential phase of the response (3, 4). This rapid rate of appearance of PFC has been equated with the rate of proliferation of these cells. That this {{need not be a}} unique interpretation of the data is suggested by studies showing that mouse PFC proliferate at a relatively slow rate, despite their rapid appearance (2). Indeed, in other systems, some workers have found a negative correlation between proliferation and immunological activity (5) ...|$|R
