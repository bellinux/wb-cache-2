40|$|On 11 th March 2010, the European Commission {{issued a}} {{marketing}} authorization valid throughout the European Union for Revolade {{for the treatment}} of adult chronic <b>immune</b> (idiopathic) <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura.</b> Revolade is an orphan medicinal product indicated for splenectomized patients with <b>immune</b> (idiopathic) <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura</b> who are refractory to other treatments (e. g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) and as second-line treatment for non-splenectomized patients where surgery is contraindicated. The active substance of Revolade is eltrombopag (ATC code B 02 BX 05). Eltrombopag increases platelet production through activation of the thrombopoietin receptor. The recommended oral dose is 50 mg once daily to achieve and maintain a platelet count of the 50 × 109 /L or more necessary to reduce or prevent the risk of bleeding. The benefit of Revolade is a durable response in maintaining platelet levels. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, hepatobiliary toxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, paresthesia, constipation, rash, pruritus, cataract, arthralgia and myalgia. The decision to grant the marketing authorization was based on the favorable recommendation of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the data submitted to the European Medicines Agency and to summarize the scientific review of the application.

40|$|EndoS from Streptococcus pyogenes {{efficiently}} hydrolyzes the functionally {{important and}} conserved N-linked glycan of IgG in human blood. Repeated i. v. administration of EndoS in rabbits completely hydrolyzes the glycans {{of the whole}} IgG pool, despite the generation of anti-EndoS antibodies. EndoS administration had no apparent effects {{on the health of}} the animals. EndoS hydrolysis of the IgG glycan has profound effects on IgG effector functions, such as complement activation and Fc receptor binding, suggesting that the enzyme could be used as an immunomodulatory therapeutic agent against IgG-mediated diseases. We demonstrate here that EndoS indeed has a protective effect in a mouse model of lethal IgG-driven <b>immune</b> (or idiopathic) <b>thrombocytopenic</b> <b>purpura.</b> EndoS pretreatment of pathogenic antibodies inhibits the development of disease, and the enzyme also rescues mice from already established disease when severe thrombocytopenia and s. c. bleeding have developed.

This study evaluated the potential drug-drug interactions between eltrombopag and the HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir. In this open-label, 3 -period, single-sequence, and crossover study, 56 healthy adult subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to cohort 1 (boceprevir) or 2 (telaprevir). The dosing was as follows: period 1, single 200 -mg dose of eltrombopag; period 2, 800 mg bocepre-vir or 750 mg telaprevir every 8 hours (q 8 h) for 10 days; and period 3, single 200 -mg dose of eltrombopag with either 800 mg bo-ceprevir or 750 mg telaprevir q 8 h (3 doses). All doses were administered with food, and eltrombopag was administered specifi-cally with low-calcium food. There was a 3 -day washout between periods 1 and 2 and no washout between periods 2 and 3. Serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected for 72 h in periods 1 and 3 and for 8 h in period 2. The coadministration of eltrombopag increased the rate of boceprevir absorption, resulting in a 20 % increase in the maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax), a 1 -h-earlier time to Cmax (Tmax) for boceprevir, a 32 % decrease in the concentration {{at the end of the}} dosing interval (C), and no change in the area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC 0 -).
