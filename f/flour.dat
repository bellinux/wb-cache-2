In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was chosen because it stood across the street from a <b>flour</b> mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first <b>flour</b> silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey <b>flour</b> directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the application of}} the laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) for quantification of total carotenoids (TC) in corn <b>flours</b> and sweetpotato <b>flours.</b> Overall, thirty-three different corn <b>flours</b> and nine sweetpotato <b>flours</b> were investigated. All PAS measurements were performed at room temperature using 488 -nm argon laser radiation for excitation and mechanical modulation of 9 and 30  Hz. The measurements were repeated within a run and within several days or months. The UV–Vis spectrophotometry was used as the reference method. The concentration range that allows for the reliable analysis of TC spans a region from 1 to 40  mg kg− 1 for corn <b>flours</b> and from 9 to 40  mg kg− 1 for sweetpotato <b>flours.</b> In the case of sweetpotato <b>flours,</b> the quantification may extend even to 240  mg kg− 1 TC. The estimated detection limit values for TC in corn and sweetpotato <b>flours</b> were 0. 1 and 0. 3  mg kg− 1, respectively. The computed repeatability (n[*]=[*] 3 – 12) and intermediate precision (n[*]=[*] 6 – 28) RSD values at 9 and 30  Hz are comparable: 0. 1 – 17. 1 % and 5. 3 – 14. 7 % for corn <b>flours</b> as compared with 1. 4 – 9. 1 % and 4. 2 – 23. 0 % for sweetpotato <b>flours.</b> Our results show that PAS can be successfully used as a new analytical tool to simply and rapidly screen the <b>flours</b> for their nutritional potential based on the total carotenoid concentration...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{introduce}} yam in the development of two new composite <b>flours</b> containing soy and cassava. Two composite <b>flours</b> were obtained after fermentation of yam, soybean, and cassava in respectively 60, 30, and 10 % proportions. Two varieties of yam were used: Dioscorea alata (variety "Bete bete") and Dioscorea cayenensis (variety "Lokpa"). Proximate composition, mineral content, some anti-nutritional factors (oxalates, phenols), microbiological quality, and &# 945;-amylase digestibility were determined for the fermented and unfermented composite <b>flours.</b> The results indicated that for the composite <b>flours</b> made of D. alata and D. cayenensis, fermentation increased ash and titrable acidity. Carbohydrates, pH, and energy decreased. Crude fat content was not affected by the fermentation process. Anti-nutritional factors such as oxalates and phenols were found to decrease significantly after the fermentation of the composite <b>flours.</b> Fermentation increased the mineral content (Mg, K, Fe, and Ca) of the composite <b>flours.</b> A decrease in P and Na was observed after fermentation. The microbiological study showed that safety <b>flours</b> contain no potential pathogenic germs. The in vitro &# 945;-amylase digestibility of the composite <b>flours</b> was significantly improved after fermentation. The biochemical characteristics and good hygienic quality of the obtained <b>flours</b> suggest that these <b>flours</b> can be considered as a feeding alternative for children in poor areas where yam is produced...|$|R

Factors Governing Pasting Properties of Waxy Wheat <b>Flours.</b> Cereal Chemistry, 92 (5), 529 - 535. doi: 10. 1094 /cchem- 10 - 14 - 0209 -rWaxy wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{contains}} endosperm starch {{lacking in}} amylose. To realize the full potential of waxy wheat, the pasting properties of hard waxy wheat <b>flours</b> {{as well as}} factors governing the pasting properties were investigated and compared with normal and partial waxy wheat <b>flours.</b> Starches isolated from six hard waxy wheat <b>flours</b> had similar pasting properties, yet their corresponding <b>flours</b> had very different pasting properties. The differences in pasting properties were narrowed after endogenous alpha-amylase activity in waxy wheat <b>flours</b> was inhibited by silver nitrate. Upon treatment with protease, the extent of protein digestibility influenced the viscosity profile in waxy wheat <b>flours.</b> Waxy wheat starch granules swelled extensively when heated in water and exhibited a high peak viscosity, but they fragmented at high temperatures, resulting in more rapid breakdown in viscosity. The extensively swelled and fragmented waxy wheat starch granules were more susceptible to a-amylase degradation than normal wheat starch. A combination of endogenous a-amylase activity and protein matrix contributed to a large variation in pasting properties of waxy wheat <b>flours...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the <b>flour</b> milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916.

40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of starchy <b>flours</b> from different origins in food systems depends greatly on {{information about the}} chemical and functional properties of such food materials. Acorns are important forestry resources in the central and southern regions of Portugal. To preserve these fruits and to optimize their use, techniques like drying are needed. The effects of different drying temperatures on starch-related functional properties of acorn <b>flours</b> obtained from dried fruits of Quercus rotundifolia (QR) and Quercus suber (QS) were evaluated. <b>Flours</b> were characterized for amylose and resistant starch (RS) contents, swelling ability, and gelatinization properties. Drying temperature mainly affected amylose content and viscoamylographic properties. Amylograms of <b>flours</b> from fruits dried at 60 ◦C displayed higher consistency (2102 B. U. and 1560 B. U., respectively, for QR and QS). The transition temperatures and enthalpy were less affected by drying temperature, suggesting few modifications in starch structure during drying.
