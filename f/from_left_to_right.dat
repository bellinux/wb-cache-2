5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line.

5|$|The {{earliest}} Hebrew writing yet discovered, {{found at}} Khirbet Qeiyafa, {{dates to the}} 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). The tablet is written <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> indicating that Hebrew writing {{was still in the}} formative stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> but also sometimes {{from right to}} left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E

5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|Just {{above the}} gate, {{there are three}} coats of arms carved in relief into the arch; <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> they are {{the arms of the}} Wardeux, Dalyngrigge, and Radynden families. The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge's wife; the Radyndens were {{relations}} of the Dalyngrigges. Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest. Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles, who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years' War, but those flanking it are blank.|$|E
5|$|On 33 {{seconds the}} 'game' itself {{begins with the}} two player {{characters}} walking <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> down a deserted street. As the first chorus begins several zombies enter from the right and are shot by the player characters. After 53 seconds the villain from the introduction appears and laughs before disappearing as the playing area is filled with zombies. The view changes to a cut scene showing close-ups of the two players sunglasses then pans out to show a spaceship illuminating the area with yellow light.|$|E

5|$|The Georgian scripts are {{the three}} writing systems used to write the Georgian language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are unicase, their letters share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right.</b> Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|The painted frieze {{above the}} astronomical clock shows five deities from {{classical}} antiquity, each representing both {{a day of}} the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. <b>From</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.|$|E
5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right).</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} {{reaction is}} an equilibrium, {{which can be}} shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving <b>from</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
