40|$|This paper {{presents}} preliminary {{estimates of}} asset service lives and <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> rates for 195 assets {{based on the}} recently constructed ESRI Survey on Capital Expenditures and Disposables (CED). The disposal surveys in the 2005 and 2006 CED collected about 260, 000 observations of disposal assets from business accounts of private corporations, of which about 26, 000 transactions include sales of disposal assets with the observed sale price of the traded asset. Although further investigations of the disposal data are still required, our estimates of <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> rates for building and construction are much higher than those assumed in the current JSNA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an estimate of}} fixed tangible wealth for the Brazilian economy in the period 1950 - 1998. Net capital stock and {{consumption of fixed capital}} are derived by the perpetual inventory method (PIM) employing a <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> function. Despite the criticism to the PIM methodology, it is used for all countries with capital stock estimates and recommended by UN (1993) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} an {{appropriate}} methodology to investigate the relation between R&D investment, knowledge stock and productivity growth is {{the main purpose of}} the paper. In analogy with physical assets, we present a model of knowledge capital formation which allows the calculation of the relevant user cost, as well. The proposed model accumulates R&D investment based on a stochastic gestation lag and a <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the stock. The basic parameters underlying the lag structure differ according to the types of research expenditure. The approach is applied to public R&D investment in Italian agriculture; the results provide interesting information about the economic structure of public research effort in Italian agriculture and plausible estimates of its internal rate of return...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{asset market}} data for {{combines}} and tractors {{are used to}} estimate and separate out historical economic depreciation, embodied technological change and time value change. Combines and tractors generally exhibit constant <b>geometric</b> economic <b>depreciation</b> on a year to year basis. Depreciation rates vary by manufacturer. Farm investors can use these manufacturer specific depreciation rates reported here to estimate terminal asset values. The study found significant seasonal differences in machinery depreciation rates. A major source of error in forecasting terminal asset values comes from changes related to time. There is a predictable time component to the constant quality asset index {{that has not been}} investigated in previous studies. Unanticipated shocks to demand should be followed by price reversion to long-run average manufacturing costs as industry capacity adjusts to demand. This reversion component is predicable. Investment risk over longer planning horizons may be lower when both depreciation coefficients and time component estimates are employed. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|The paper fits a hedonic {{regression}} {{model to the}} sales of condominium units in Tokyo over the period 2000 - 2015. The problem {{is complicated by the}} need to decompose the selling price of a unit into a component that {{can be attributed to the}} structure area of the unit and another component that can be attributed to the unit's share of land value. There is very little information on the value of condominium land and so this paper develops a methodology for reducing this knowledge gap. The paper extends the builder's model which was developed in Eurostat (2013) [11]. Characteristics which prove to be important in explaining condominium prices are: the floor space area of the unit, the total land area of the building, the number of units in the building, the total number of stories in the building, the height of the sold unit, the age of the structure and the amount of excess land. The paper also derives an estimate for the annual <b>geometric</b> structure <b>depreciation</b> rate for condominiums in Tokyo. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{considers}} {{the measurement of}} capital services aggregates under alternative assumptions about the form of depreciation, the opportunity cost of capital and the treatment of capital gains. Four different models of depreciation are considered: (1) one hoss shay or light bulb depreciation; (2) straight line depreciation; (3) declining balance or <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> and (4) linearly declining efficiency profiles. The chapter also {{considers the}} differences between cross section and time series depreciation and anticipated time series depreciation (which adds anticipated obsolescence of the asset to normal cross section depreciation of the asset). Finally, issues involving the measurement of certain intangible capital stocks are considered.

40|$|The {{conditions}} under which the unobserved shadow price of capital can be equated to the financial value of the firm have been developed in an important paper by Hayashi (1982). Employing a more powerful analytic method, this paper reexamines the shadow price- asset value relation in a model with a general set of intertemporal constraints. For a model with one capital good, a general relation between shadow prices and asset values is derived, and restrictive assumptions implicit in previous work are highlighted. Of particular importance is {{the relation between the}} marginal and average survival rates of capital, and the critical role of <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation.</b> The impact of a discrete-time framework in specifying and interpreting econometric models is also explored. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} an {{appropriate}} methodology to analyse the relation between R&D investments and the knowledge stock is {{the main purpose of}} the paper. The high estimates of internal rates of return on agricultural R&D reported in the literature suggest that there are major empirical problems with the traditional attribution of productivity growth to R&D investments. We model a stochastic gestation lag of research investment and a <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the knowledge stock. This model of knowledge accumulation from R&D investments outlines the basic parameters underlying the investment lag structure. According to the different types of research project, the approach is applied to public R&D expenditure in Italian agriculture in order to ascertain the empirical consequences and potential of the model. knowledge stock, lag structure, research and development...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} whether {{government}} capital is productive has {{received a lot of}} attention in the recent past. Yet, empirical analyses of public capital productivity have in general been limited to a small sample of countries for which official capital stock estimates are available. Alternatively, many researchers have investigated the output effects of public investment – recognizing that investment may be a poor proxy for the corresponding capital stock. This paper tries to overcome this data shortage by providing internationally comparable capital stock estimates for a large panel of OECD countries. The estimates are calculated using the perpetual inventory method and assuming <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation.</b> The paper also reports the results of a sensitivity analysis regarding the main estimation assumptions as well as estimates of the output elasticity of public capital for alternative capital stock measures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the methodology of}} capital stock measurement for the Chilean economy by types of assets and different economic activities, according to the Reference Compilation 2003 of National Accounts System. Capital stocks by types of assets are estimated under the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM), while the activity sectors approach follows to Harberger (1972) method. Specifically, integrated and consistent measurements for investment, capital stock (gross and net) and {{consumption of fixed capital}} are presented. We assume different patterns of retirement and survival and depreciation functions, following the international evidence and previous studies for the case of Chile. The findings show that the assumed average service lives of the assets are key. Also, <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation</b> is used and then compared with the linear depreciation functions. The main results show a continuum growth of net capital stocks/PIB ratio from 1996 to 2005 up to 2. 3 %. The consumption of fixed capital/GDP ratio is 10. 4 % (assuming linear depreciation) for the period 2003 - 2005, below the National Accounts measure (12 %) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic {{oligopoly}} model {{of competition in}} local exchange markets to analyze the impacts that mandatory sharing of incumbent facilities has upon investment in telecommunications infrastructure. Our model is distinguished from other treatments {{of the relationship between}} unbundling and investment by capturing the microeconomic structure underlying strategic interaction of the various providers competing in these markets. We calibrate the structural parameters using market data and then use those values to simulate investment outcomes under alternative unbundling policies. In the model, three types of providers supply both voice and data services in each geographic market using their own network facilities: an incumbent local exchange carrier (“ILEC”), a cable television company (“CATV”), and a facilities-based competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC-F”). A fourth type of carrier, the “CLEC-L, ” provides these services by leasing facilities from the ILEC at regulated wholesale rates. Each of the three facilities-based carriers chooses a level of capital investment to maximize the net present value of its cash flows. Capital obeys the conventional accumulation rule that assumes <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation.</b> All four carrier...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{consequences of}} some important assumptions ofthe perpetual inventory method of capital stock calculation under <b>geometric</b> <b>depreciation.</b> The data are plant-level panel {{data from the}} Norwegian manufacturing statistics, containing independent measures of capital stocks and gross investment flows for two capital types and three industries. First, we look at consequences of choosing different depreciation rates a priori, when we use as benchmark for {{the level of the}} capital stocks deflated fire insurance values in a specific year. The choice of depreciation rate is of substantial importance, some values resulting in decreasing, other in increasing capital stocks over time. Second, we attempt to estimate depreciation rates by combining time series on gross investment and fire insurance values for the same period. In our regression models, both systematic and random measurement errors in the fire insurance values and various forms of heterogeneity in the coefficient structure are represented. We conclude that the estimated depreciation rates vary significantly with the specification of the measurement error process and that heterogeneity in this process across plants is important.
