In collaboration with the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), a statistically designed producer sample was selected to provide estimates for the United States sheep population in the 48 contiguous states. The NAHMS/ASI questionnaires were mailed to 19, 807 sheep operations in January 1996; data were received and summarized from 5, 174 respondents. It was estimated that in the 48 contiguous states, there were approximately 8, 433, 400 sheep as of January 1, 1996. The greatest percentages of sheep {{were found in the}} Mountain and West South Central regions of the United States (33. 6 percent and 20. 6 percent, respectively). The majority of operations in all regions were farm flocks. Culling of sheep one year of age or older was greatest in the East South Central region (38. 3 percent of sheep) and lowest in the Mountain region (12. 7 percent of sheep). Old age was the reason most frequently given for culling or death in all regions except East South Central, where the reason most frequently given was economic. By region, the condition present on the greatest number of operations was stomach/intestinal worms, except in the Mountain and East South Central regions, in which the conditions present on the greatest number of operations were sheep ticks and footrot, respectively. The West North Central Region had the greatest percentage of operations adding antibiotics to feed or water (42. 5 percent during the previous 3 years), while the Northeast region had the lowest (21. 0 percent during the previous 3 years).

In this study, a compartmentalized, early-stage OA was generated surgically in sheep stifle joints, and this model was used to evaluate a matrix-associated cell transplantation approach for cartilage repair. MethodEighteen sheep were operated twice. During the first operation, a unicompartmental OA in a stable joint was induced by creating a critical-size defect. The second operation served as a regeneration procedure. The eighteen sheep were divided into three groups. One group was treated with spongialization (SPONGIO), while the two others had spongialization followed by implantation of a hyaluronan matrix with (MACT) or without chondrocytes (MATRIX). The follow-up took place 4 months after the second <b>operation.</b> <b>Gross</b> Assessment of Joint Changes score and Brittberg score were used for the macroscopic evaluation, Mankin score, O'Driscoll score, and immunohistochemistry for collagen type I and type II for histological evaluation. ResultsThe MACT group achieved significantly better results in both macroscopic and histological examinations. In the regeneration area, a Mankin score of 7. 88 (6. 20; 9. 55) [mean (upper 95 % confidence interval; lower 95 % confidence interval) ] was reached in the MACT group, 10. 38 (8. 03; 12. 72) in the MATRIX group, and 10. 33 (8. 80; 11. 87) in the SPONGIO group.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} {{and extent of}} submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer and to evaluate {{the impact on the}} tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. Method: Fifty-seven resected specimens of hypopharyngeal cancer were studied in detail from January 1986 to December 1989 by use of the whole-organ, step-serial sectioning technique. Results: Three types of submucosal tumor extension could be identified. Type I extension was characterized by a tumor with a smooth round contour that extended submucosally. The mucosa was thereby elevated and was detectable on <b>gross</b> inspection at <b>operation.</b> In type II extension, tongues and islands of tumor infiltrated within the submucosa, and these were not noticeable on gross examination. Skip metastasis in the submucosa where the submucosal tumor was completely separated from the main tumor bulk was classified as type III extension. Thirty-three patients (58 %) had submucosal tumor ex tension. The frequencies (and extents of submucosal tumor extension) in the superior, medial, lateral, and inferior directions were 16 % (3 - 10 mm), 37 % (2 - 37 mm). 26 % (2 - 37 mm), and 28 % C 3 - 35 mm), respectively. Two thirds of the submucosal extension was type I (22 of 33), and only i patient had a true skip lesion submucosally (type III extension). Type II submucosal extension was found in one third of the patients (11 of 33). This occurred significantly more often in the patients who had received radiotherapy before surgery (82 % [9 / 11]; P<. 001; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 28 - 4. 44). The presence of submucosal tumor extension had no effect on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. Conclusions: The incidence of submucosal tumor extensions in hypopharyngeal cancer is high (58 %), but most (67 %) of them can be detected grossly at operation. The presence of submucosal tumor extension does not adversely affect the survival and tumor recurrence rates. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

And if we look a little nearer into the state of animals, we shall find that their dependence, as to life, motion, and the most considerable qualities to be observed in them, is so wholly on extrinsical causes and qualities of other bodies that make no part of them, that they cannot subsist a moment without them: though yet those bodies on which they depend are little taken notice of, and make no part of the complex ideas we frame of those animals. Take the air but for a minute from the greatest part of living creatures, and they presently lose sense, life, and motion. This the necessity of breathing has forced into our knowledge. But how many other extrinsical and possibly very remote bodies do the springs of these admirable machines depend on, which are not vulgarly observed, or so much as thought on; and how many are there which the severest inquiry can never discover? The inhabitants of this spot of the universe, though removed so many millions of miles from the sun, yet depend so much on the duly tempered motion of particles coming from or agitated by it, that were this earth removed but a small part of the distance out of its present situation, and placed a little further or nearer that source of heat, it is more than probable that the greatest part of the animals in it would immediately perish: since we find them so often destroyed by an excess or defect of the sun's warmth, which an accidental position in some parts of this our little globe exposes them to. The qualities observed in a loadstone must needs have their source far beyond the confines of that body; and the ravage made often on several sorts of animals by invisible causes, the certain death (as we are told) of some of them, by barely passing the line, or, as it is certain of other, by being removed into a neighbouring country; evidently show that the concurrence and operations of several bodies, with which they are seldom thought to have anything to do, is absolutely necessary to make them be what they appear to us, and to preserve those qualities by which we know and distinguish them. We are then quite out of the way, when we think that things contain WITHIN THEMSELVES the qualities that appear to us in them; and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a fly or an elephant, upon which depend those qualities and powers we observe in them. For which, perhaps, to understand them aright, we ought to look not only beyond this our earth and atmosphere, but even beyond the sun or remotest star our eyes have yet discovered. For how much the being and operation of particular substances in this our globe depends on causes utterly beyond our view, is impossible for us to determine. We see and perceive some of the motions and <b>grosser</b> <b>operations</b> of things here about us; but whence the streams come that keep all these curious machines in motion and repair, how conveyed and modified, is beyond our notice and apprehension: and the great parts and wheels, as I may so say, of this stupendous structure of the universe, may, for aught we know, have such a connexion and dependence in their influences and operations one upon another, that perhaps things in this our mansion would put on quite another face, and cease to be what they are, if some one of the stars or great bodies incomprehensibly remote from us, should cease to be or move as it does. This is certain: things, however absolute and entire they seem in themselves, are but retainers to other parts of nature, for that which they are most taken notice of by us. Their observable qualities, actions, and powers are owing to something without them; and there is not so complete and perfect a part that we know of nature, which does not owe the being it has, and the excellences of it, to its neighbours; and we must not confine our thoughts within the surface of any body, but look a great deal further, to comprehend perfectly those qualities that are in it.|$|R
40|$|Switched-mode power {{converters}} {{are some of}} the most widely used power electronics circuits due to their advantages of high conversion efficiency, flexible output voltage, light weight. A variety of control methods have been developed for the switched-mode {{power converters}}. However, in many practical situation, additional constraints need to be considered, e. g., safety measurement, current limiting or soft-starting, <b>gross</b> changes of <b>operation</b> point with guaranteed system stability, which has not been fully addressed in the available research works. On the other hand, the majority of the control design for power converters are based on the state-space averaged approach which involves considerable approximation in analysis and synthesis. Hence, advanced control techniques are in demand, which should be more constraints friendly and based on more precise models. In this thesis, much attention has been spent on designing controllers for both DC-DC converters and DC-AC inverters based on hybrid modelling and Lyapunov stability theory. Due to the existence of the power switches, switched-mode power converters are hybrid systems with both continuous dynamics and discrete transition events. Instead of linearizing the converter model around a specific operating point, hybrid modelling captures both dynamics, which results in more accurate models. Firstly, a novel sampled-data control approach is proposed for DC-DC converters. DC-DC converters are modeled as sampled-data switched affine systems according to the status of the power switch. In order to avoid the delay of the switching signal, an on-line prediction method is adopted to estimate the system state at the next switching instant. Based on the switched affine model and the predicted system state, a novel switching control algorithm is synthesized by using the switched Lyapunov theory. The proposed approach is able to not only drive the output to a prescribed set point from any initial condition, but also track a varying reference signal, and the switching frequency can be adjusted online with guaranteed stability. In addition, with this approach, Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) operations can be treated in a unified way. Experimental verification has been carried out to test the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method. Furthermore, to compensate the information loss due to limited access to the state, a multiple sampling scheme is employed to derive a discrete-time switched affine model with an augmented measurement output for DC-DC converters. Based on the model, an output-feedback switching control law, which drives the system state to a set of attainable switched equilibria, is synthesized by using a quadratic state-space partition. The multiple sampling scheme not only facilitates the controller synthesis, but also improves the energy efficiency of the converter by allowing a lower switching frequency. In addition, hybrid modelling techniques have been extended to more complicated cases – DC-AC inverters as the increasing number of power switches and the time-variant nature of the references. A current controller based on the hybrid model of the three-phase two-level inverter has been developed, which can drive the inverter currents tracking the desired power references in realtime and keep a unity power factor at the same time. This method has been extended to three-phase NPC inverters later on. However, in order to solve the neutral point balancing issue, a capacitor voltages prediction algorithm, modified from model predictive control, has been adopted. It should also be mentioned that a novel hybrid model for a grid-connected single-phase NPC inverter also has been presented, which models not only the dynamic of the inverter but also the dynamic of the current reference. An experimental test platform including a three-phase NPC inverter and a FPGA control board has been designed to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed control scheme in practice...|$|R
