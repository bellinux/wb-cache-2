The circuit topology {{eliminates the need for}} a rectifying diode, reducing the effect of charge injection into the <b>hold</b> <b>capacitor,</b> incorporates a linear gate at the input to prevent pulse pileup, and uses dynamic bias control that minimizes both pedestal and droop. Both positive-going and negative-going pulses are accommodated using a complementary set of {{track and hold}} circuits. Full characterization of the design fabricated in 1. 2 {mu}m CMOS including dynamic range, integral nonlinearity, droop rate, pedestal, and power measurements is presented. Additionally, analysis and design approaches for optimization of operational characteristics are discussed...|$|E

This amplitude bears a given relationship to the phase of the reference signal and {{is used as a}} measure of the difference between the input and reference signal for forming the control signal that controls the voltage-controlled oscillator. The reference signal may be sinusoidal, triangular, or an asymmetric sawtooth. The control input of the phase detector is connected to a stage that shapes the sample pulses.

40|$|High speed analog-to-digital {{converters}} {{capable of}} digitizing signals with bandwidths of several tens of GHz have applications in high-speed instrumentation, wideband radar and optical communications. However, {{the design of}} converters with such high input bandwidths is constrained by the need for wideband sample-and-hold circuits with sufficiently low clock jitter. A number of photonic sampling techniques have been proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional electronic sampling circuits [1]. This work introduces a parallel ADC architecture, shown in Fig. 18. 2. 1, wherein {{a large number of}} time-interleaved photonic sampling channels each feed a 4 b, 1 GS/s CMOS ADC.

The time domain is discrete, however. Distinct analog samples are shifted through an array of <b>holding</b> <b>capacitors</b> as in a bucket brigade. Analog adders and amplifiers do the arithmetic in the signal domain, just as in an analog computer.|$|R
40|$|A new clock-feedthrough {{compensation}} scheme for switchedcurrent circuits is proposed. The scheme is especially {{suited for the}} design of delay lines for high-frequency operation. The circuit operates by using an improved two-step technique, in which the input is sampled in a parallel combination of a coarse and a fine memory transistor. Since both transistors are of the same type, large switching transients compared to the conventional SSS 2 III scheme can be avoided. Using the proposed circuit, the coarse memory has considerably more time to settle. Compared to the simple cell, the circuit solution requires only one extra switch and one additional clock phase. Index Terms [...] - Analog sampled-data circuits, charge injection, sample /hold, switched-current circuits. I.

40|$|In conclusion, an {{integrated}} {{tapped delay line}} structure consisting of a coplanar waveguide transmission line with Schottky diode peak detector taps has been fabricated. The structure was driven with two pulse compressor circuits producing two 20 pS pulse trains. The relative phases of the two inputs were determined from the position along the struc-ture of the collision event as captured by the <b>hold</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Shifts of 1 pS in the trigger input signal were easily detectable during steady state testing of the structure. Improvements in the current resolution should be possible with better pulse compression circuits yielding greater slew rates for input pulses and reduced dispersion due to tap discontinuities by further distribution of the taps along the line. Finally, when coupled with external processing circuitry the CPPD should be capable of picosecond resolution detection of trigger events in one-shot or in steady state...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} an ultrafast {{sample and}} hold circuit using optically triggered metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) switches made of low temperature (LT) grown GaAs {{for use in a}} photonic A/D conversion system. We incorporate a differential configuration to reduce feedthrough noise. Many proposed photonic A/D conversion systems consist of an input electrical signal biasing an optical modulator whose output is optically de-multiplexed to an array of electrical A/D converters [1, 2]. However, the speed and linearity of the optical modulator limit the performance of these systems. To circumvent this problem, we propose a {{sample and hold}} scheme utilizing LT grown GaAs MSM switches. The short recombination lifetime and high mobility of LT grown GaAs allow high-speed operation with good sensitivity [3]. Optically triggered by a short pulse laser, the switches would be attached to a transmission line and would sample the input electrical signal onto a <b>hold</b> <b>capacitor.</b> One potential drawback of this [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic CMOS {{operational}} amplifier {{with a special}} input circuit which injects an extra bias current to increase the slew-rate, depending on the input signal. The performance of this operational amplifier is compared to a conventional operational amplifier when used in a sample andhold circuit. The maximum operating clock frequency of the sample andhold circuit increases from 290 kHz up to 1 MHz with a hold-capacitor of 1 nF. The amplifier has been fabricated in a 5 mym CMOS process and dissipates a static power of 7. 5 mW. In this contribution we present a very-high-slew-rate CMOS operational amplifier. It uses a circuit to inject an extra bias current into a conventional source coupled CMOS differential input signals. This measure substantially increases the slew rate of an operational amplifier for a given quiescent current. We compare the performance of this operational amplifier to a conventional operational amplifier when used in a sample-and-hold circuit. The maximum operating clock frequency of the sample-and-hold increases from 290 kHz to 1 MHz with a <b>hold</b> <b>capacitor</b> of 1 nF.

40|$|Within {{the past}} few years, various {{photonic}} A/D conversion systems have achieved speed and resolution performance far surpassing conventional mixed signal technology, lending merit to this hybrid approach [1, 2]. In our system, we utilize an optically triggered, electrical sample and hold scheme with low temperature (LT) grown GaAs MSM switches. The switch {{is attached to a}} transmission line and samples the input electrical signal onto a <b>hold</b> <b>capacitor</b> when optically activated by a short-pulse laser. An electrical A/D converter then digitizes the held signal. By time-interleaving a number of these channels, the aggregate sampling rate of the system is increased, with the larger bandwidth requirements being placed on the input sample and hold. The short carrier trapping time and relatively high mobility of the LT GaAs material provide broadband sampling capability with good optical sensitivity [3]. Previously, we demonstrated a sample and hold test circuit with 5. 7 effective number of bits (ENOB) accuracy under dc input conditions and a sampling gate width of less than 2 ps [4]. The sample and hold process exhibits good linearity for up to 20 GHz input frequency and a> 50 GHz 3 dB bandwidth [5]. In this work, we demonstrate LT GaAs MSM switches integrated with the front-end silicon-CMOS buffer amplifier stage with linear sampling capability from dc to 20 GHz input frequency. To our knowledge, this represents the highest bandwidth of any integrated system with CMOS technology...|$|E
40|$|A GaAs FET {{analog switch}} {{comprises}} an input node, an output node and a terminating element {{which can be}} designed as a <b>holding</b> <b>capacitor</b> which {{is connected to the}} output nodes. Between the two nodes is a switching transistor. A drive circuit controls the gate of the switching transistor as a function of a scanning control signal. To avoid transient errors, fault voltages in switched-off state and switching noise during switch-on state with a short transient time, the invention proposes to insert a dummy transistor between the input of the analog switch and the source electrode of the switching transistor and a dummy transistor between the train electrode between the switching transistor and the output node of the GaAs FET analog switch. Furthermore, the invention proposes to use a second drive circuit which serves to drive the gate of the two dummy transistors at opposite phases to the control circuit with which the first driver circuit controls the gate of the switching transistor...|$|R
50|$|For {{practically}} all commercial liquid crystal active matrix displays based on TN, IPS or VA electro-optic LC cells (excluding bi-stable phenomena), each pixel represents a small capacitor, {{which has to}} be periodically charged to a level corresponding to the greyscale value (contrast) desired for a picture element. In {{order to maintain the}} level during a scanning cycle (frame period), an additional electric capacitor is attached in parallel to each LC pixel to better hold the voltage. A thin-film FET switch is addressed to select a particular LC pixel and charge the picture information for it. In contrast to an S/H in general electronics, there is no output operational amplifier and no electrical signal AO. Instead, the charge on the <b>hold</b> <b>capacitors</b> controls the deformation of the LC molecules and thereby the optical effect as its output. The invention of this concept and its implementation in thin-film technology have been honored with the IEEE Jun-ichi Nishizawa Medal in 2011.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{programmable}} {{gain and}} bandwidth first-order low-pass Gm-C filter is proposed, designed, and simulated. Continuous low-offset operation {{is achieved by}} combining the continuity and low offset features of the ping-pong and autozeroing schemes. In the proposed strategy, clock feedthrough and charge injection are also reduced by decoupling the <b>holding</b> <b>capacitor</b> from the ac-signal path and increasing its value without affecting filter response. The ping-pong operation is designed to occur on the dominant pole-setting node, where a large capacitor resides, thereby also attenuating the glitches normally associated with “hand-over ” events. The gain and bandwidth are programmed by adjusting the transconductance and loading resistance of the filter, achieving gain and bandwidth ranges and resolutions of 2 – 40 V/V, 75 mV/V, 1 – 5 KHz, and 32 Hz, respectively. Worst-case Monte Carlo simulations of the proposed 0. 5 µm CMOS IC resulted in an input-referred offset of less than 0. 5 mV and hand-over glitches below 5 mV.

40|$|All MOS sample-and-hold {{circuits}} suffer to {{a greater}} or lesser extent from clock-feedthrough (CLFT), also called charge-injection. During the transition from sample to hold mode, charge is transferred from an MOS transistor switch onto the <b>hold</b> <b>capacitor,</b> thus the name charge-injection. This error can lead to considerable voltage change across the capacitor, and predicting the extent of the induced error potentials is important to circuit designers. Previous studies have shown a considerable dependency of CLFT on signal voltage, circuit impedances, clock amplitude and clock fall-time. The focus of this work was on the signal dependency of the CLFT error and on the CLFT induced signal distortion in open-loop sample-and-hold circuits. CLFT was found to have a strongly non-linear, signal dependent, component, which may cause considerable distortion of the sampled signal. The parameters influencing this distortion were established. It was discovered that distortion could be reduced by more than 20 dB through careful adjustment of the clock fall-rate. Several circuit solutions that can help reduce the level of distortion arising from CLFT are presented. These circuits can also reduce the absolute level of CLFT. Simulations showed their effectiveness, which was also proven in silicon. The CLFT reduction methods used in these circuits are easily transferable to other switched-capacitor circuits and are suitable for applications where space is at a premium (as, for example, in analogue neural networks). A new saturation mode contribution to CLFT was found. It is shown to give rise to increased CLFT under high injection conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{dual-mode}} {{input voltage}} modulation (IVM) control scheme for a three-phase ZCS series resonant (SR) inverter fed three-phase voltage multiplier based DC-DC converter for X-ray power generator is proposed. The three-phase ZCS SR inverter is formed by connecting three single-phase ZCS SR inverters in parallel and delaying the gating signals by 120 degrees {{with respect to}} each other. It operates at constant frequency & duty ratio. The lower arms of all the three single-phase inverters (i. e. which make three-phase ZCS-SR inverter) are connected to a common <b>holding</b> <b>capacitor</b> CH and the voltage V-H across it, is controlled by a control circuit. At the turn ON of the converter, the control circuit clamp voltage V-H to 0 V, causing inverter to see full input voltage and output voltage to rise with maximum speed. As the output voltage reaches 80 % of target voltage value, the voltage VH is raised from 0 V to (V-H) ref, thereby reducing the effective input voltage to inverter. As a result the rise rate of output voltage slow downs and the over shoot is prevented. Experimental results based on the laboratory scale-down prototype are presented to verify the effectiveness of proposed dual-mode IVM control scheme. ...|$|R

A second wiper reads this representation of the signal, and sends it to a voltage amplifier that mixes it with the original source.

50|$|The two {{widely used}} forms of modern RAM are static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). In SRAM, {{a bit of}} data is stored using the state of a six {{transistor}} memory cell. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as cache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM memory cell. The <b>capacitor</b> <b>holds</b> a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.|$|R
40|$|The Conventional offline {{switched}} Mode Power supply (SMPS) and Near Unity Power Factor Converters (NUPF) {{are exposed}} to Differential Mode (DM) and Common Mode (CM) LT power line transients. The front-end rectifier system converts the CM transients to DM transients because of the variation of the diode capacitance in the duration of transients. The NUPF are more vulnerable to such CM transients than conventional SMPS because of the smaller value of <b>hold</b> up <b>capacitor.</b> It has been found experimentally that the magnitude of DM converted transients varies with the time of occurrence with respect to AC mains voltage wave and is maximum when it occurs at zero crossing. Its magnitude is higher for lesser rise times and higher coupling capacitance to ground. Simulation and experimental studies have verified this. The results obtained are in close agreement. Three types of protective elements i. e. MOV, Line Filter, and RC Snubbers were used to mitigate this transient. It {{has been found that}} RC Snubbers were most effective. RC Snubbers are conventionally used to suppress over voltage DM transients occuring on LT power lines and are effective only to DM transients. There can be four such snubbers one across each of the diode in the bridge or even one snubber across the bridge. But, for reducing the CM converted DM transients it is essential to connect snubbers across all the four bridge rectifiers. If not the imbalance of two circuits, line to ground and Neutral to ground will persist and Mode converted transients will not be reduced. A method to calculate the RC snubber values for this purpose has been proposed. The simulations were carried out in Pspice and are supported by experimental results...|$|R
40|$|It {{would be}} useful to know the total kernel mass within a given mass of peanuts (mass ratio) while the peanuts are bought or being processed. In this work, the {{possibility}} of finding the mass ratio while the peanuts were in their shells was investigated. Capacitance, phase angle, and dissipation factor measurements on a parallel-plate <b>capacitor</b> <b>holding</b> in-shell peanut samples were made at frequencies from 1 to 10 &#x 2009;MHz insteps of 1 &#x 2009;MHz. A calibration equation was developed by multilinear regression analysis correlating the percentage ratio of the kernel weight with the measured capacitance, dissipation factor, and phase angle values of in-shell peanut samples with known kernel weights. The equation was used to predict the percentage mass ratio in the validation groups. Fitness of calibration model was verified using standard error of calibration, root mean square error of calibration, and leverage and influence plots. The predictability percentage, within 1 &# 37; and 2 &# 37; of the visual determination, was calculated by comparing the kernel mass ratio, obtained by the model equation and the reference value obtained by visual determination.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design of power {{converters}} that deliver isolated low-voltage dc output (~ 24 V) and operate from "universal" ac input voltage (85 - 264 Vac RMS). It is important that these converters have good overall efficiency (~ 90 - 95 %), and good ac line power factor (> 0. 9, and ideally > 0. 95) to better utilize the available energy. This thesis looks into achieving high efficiency, high power factor, low voltage stresses, and smaller component sizes by utilizing high frequency operation. The research focuses on component and subsystem evaluation, development and testing {{as a part of}} many-person research in this space. The thesis presents a literature based study on current PFC circuit designs and tradeoffs. It also introduces a specific PFC architecture, which provides a low dc output voltage drawing energy from a wide range ac input voltage while maintaining a high power factor. The architecture includes two stages: The first is a "Power Factor Correction" (PFC) which functions as an input stage drawing energy from a wide-range input current. It uses a resonant transition inverted (RTI) buck converter topology to step down the voltage from line voltage (85 - 264 Vac RMS) to around 72 V. Furthermore, the inductor for the RTI buck is analyzed. The middle stage is an energy buffer to provide the required energy level for twice line frequency energy buffering and 20 ms of energy <b>hold</b> up. The <b>capacitor</b> requirements, analysis, and selection are explored and developed. The second stage is a transformation and regulation stage which also provides electrical isolation between the ac input and dc output. The thesis also explores the use of available conventional high-density telecom "brick" converters as a second stage. In conclusion, the project explores the possibility of using a buck configuration for the PFC, sacrificing the ability to use high energy density 400 V capacitors while gaining the advantage of using the high-density telecom brick converters and different output voltage options. by Ali Saeed AlShehab.
