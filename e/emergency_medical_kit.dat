50|$|In Haiti, {{after the}} Hurricane Matthew made {{landfall}} on October 4 2016, Medair's emergency response team landed in Port-au-Prince in 72 {{hours of the}} hurricane. Medair has assembled emergency shelter and hygiene kits, although the access to the affected coastal communities of Tiburon Peninsula was very difficult. The main road leading to the nearest city of Les Cayes had been badly damaged. As first response, Medair teams traveled by sea to distribute 300 hygiene kits to help prevent cholera. In total, Medair distributed <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>kits</b> with medicine for 20,000 people, distributed shelter kits to more than 14,000 people, and gave 16,000 people access to safe drinking water.|$|R

The participants were given training about animals native to the island {{that are on the}} protected species list, and each received one day's survival training, including advice on how to catch and humanely kill caiman. The men were given machetes and knives, head torches, an initial one-day water supply, and an <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>kit.</b> In addition, the participants had GPS spot trackers, and access to radio and satellite phone in case of emergency.

5000|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaned {{over in his}} seat. Her {{attempts}} {{to get his attention}} failed. After asking [...] "What are you doing?" [...] Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse which led into the shoe, and a lit match. She tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she yelled for help, and ran to get water. When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her, biting her thumb, and Moutardier threw water in his face. Several passengers worked together to subdue the 6 foot 4 inch (193 cm) tall, 200+ pound (90+ kg) Reid. They restrained him using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, leather waist belts and headphone cords. A doctor on board administered a tranquiliser to him which he found in the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>kit</b> of the airliner. The flight was immediately diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, the closest US airport.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Research {{and data}} {{regarding}} in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> during commercial air travel are lacking. Although volunteer medical professionals are {{often called upon}} to assist, there are no guidelines or best practices to guide their actions. This paper reviews the literature quantifying and categorizing in-flight medical incidents, discusses the unique challenges posed by the in-flight environment, evaluates the legal aspects of volunteering to provide care, and suggests an approach to managing specific conditions at 30, 000 feet. Methods: We conducted a MEDLINE search using search terms relevant to aviation <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> and flight physiology. The reference lists of selected articles were reviewed to identify additional studies. Results: While incidence studies were limited by data availability, syncope, gastrointestinal upset, and respiratory complaints were among the most common medical events reported. Chest pain and cardiovascular events were commonly associated with flight diversion. Conclusion: When in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> occur, volunteer physicians should have knowledge about the most common in-flight medical incidents, know what is available in on-board <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>kits,</b> coordinate their therapy with the flight crew and remote resources, and provide care within their scope of practice.

Crewdson was a Pulitzer finalist in 1986 for his exhaustive reporting on the inadequacy of in-flight medical supplies aboard commercial airliners. His coverage prompted most major airlines to begin carrying portable defibrillators and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>kits.</b> In addition to the Pulitzer and the Polk awards, Crewdson's other journalistic prizes include the Sigma Delta Chi bronze medallion, the New York Deadline Club's Goldberg award, the New York Newspaper Guild's Page One Award, and the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel award. After 28 years at the Chicago Tribune, Crewdson joined the Washington-based investigative reporting team at Bloomberg News, where he produced exclusive stories on campaign finance which garnered the National Press Foundation’s Dirksen Award for coverage of congress, the National Press Club’s Lee Walczak Award for Political Analysis, and honorable mention for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting. In 2015, Crewdson shared the Sigma Delta Chi award for non-deadline reporting for “Dangerous Decision-making at the FDA." [...] He was also awarded second place in the Association of Health Care Journalists' annual award for excellence for his reporting on the FDA's flawed drug approval process. The Society of American Business Editors and Writers also honored Crewdson as a finalist for his “Exhaustive reconstruction of the FDA’s failures, misjudgments, and blind eye to conflicts of interest.” ...|$|R

The efficacy of VIT was demonstrated in three prospective controlled and a number of prospective uncontrolled studies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{dispatch}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> {{services at}} the onset of acute stroke is vital in expediting assessment and treatment. We examined the relationship between callers' description of potential stroke symptoms to the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher and the subsequent classification and prioritisation of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services response. AIM: To identify key 'indicator' words used by people making emergency calls for suspected stroke, comparing these with the subsequent category of response given by the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> dispatcher. METHOD: A retrospective chart review (hospital and <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services) in North West England (October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007) identified digitally recorded <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services calls, which related to patients who had a diagnosis of suspected stroke at some point on the stroke pathway (from the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services call taker through to final medical diagnosis). Using content analysis, words used to describe stroke by the caller were recorded. A second researcher independently followed the same procedure in order to produce a list of 'indicator' words. Description of stroke-specific and nonstroke-specific problems reported by the caller was compared with subsequent <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services dispatch coding and demographic features. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-three calls were made to <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services of which 592 (92...|$|R
