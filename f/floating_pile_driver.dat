40|$|The use of {{centrifuge}} modeling {{offers another}} way for geotechnical engineers {{to investigate the}} loaded driven pile behaviors. It {{is well known that}} centrifuge tests take the place of in site tests to perform parametric studies useful to get a database for recommendations and to improve design codes. To accurately simulate loaded driven pile behavior, some conditions must be satisfied. A fundamental one is the checking of similitude laws linked to the pile behavior; the second concern an experimental aspect i. e. the installation of driven pile. To study and to fill these conditions, centrifuge pile hammers must be developed. A first difficulty is to conceive a miniature hammer supporting macro gravity effects and to achieve a model pile driving in flight. The paper describes the similitude laws linked to the driving of a pile and some of them have been already checked and validated during a pile driving centrifuge tests using a miniature <b>pile</b> <b>driver.</b> A recap of centrifuge <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> is proposed before to describe in details the last two <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> used the LCPC centrifuge.

40|$|Nowadays in Russia {{there has}} been {{intensive}} transition from low-rise construction to the high-rise construction. High-rise construction requires reliable foundations. However, these foundations can be performed only by using modern technologies and construction machinery. In this regard, the optimization problem of choice the necessary construction equipment gains in special importance. This article is devoted to refining the selection of equipment for pile driving, inter alia, the vibratory <b>pile</b> <b>drivers.</b> The additional selection criteria of vibratory <b>pile</b> <b>drivers</b> are proposed by {{increasing the number of}} parameters on the basis of systematic approach.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{located within}} consolidating ground are commonly subjected to negative skin friction (NSF) and failures of pile foundations related to dragload (compressive force) and downdrag (pile settlement) {{have been reported}} in literature. In addition, they are normally subjected to axial load and NSF simultaneously. A field study was carried out to investigate load transfer behavior of piles in end-bearing and floating 2 -pile groups in consolidating ground. Moreover, load transfer mechanisms of piles subjected to NSF was investigated in detail by centrifuge tests and axis-symmetric and three-dimensional numerical analyses to achieve three objectives: to investigate response of a single pile subjected to NSF with different pile tip locations with respect to end-bearing stratum, to study behavior of <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> subjected to NSF with and without shielding by sacrificing piles, and, to study effects of axial load on load transfer mechanism along a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> and shielded center pile within a group of sacrificing piles experiencing locked-in NSF. Based on field monitoring, downdrag developed on <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> is 70 % more than that on end-bearing piles and neutral plane (NP) is located deeper with stiffer end-bearing layer. Measured maximum β values ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 for piles located inside the end-bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> groups. Based on centrifuge tests results, the maximum dragload developed at a single end-bearing pile is 60 % more than that at a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile,</b> whereas downdrag developed on single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> is 200 % greater than that on a single end-bearing pile. Both centrifuge and field monitoring results show larger downdrag obtained for <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> than that of end-bearing pile. From centrifuge modeling results, the measured maximum β value at a single end-bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> was similar and slightly smaller than 0. 3. On the other hand, smaller β values of 0. 1 and 0. 2 were mobilized at the shielded center piles for pile spacings of 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D, respectively, where D is center pile diameter. Consistent results of β values are obtained between centrifuge modeling and fielding monitoring. The use of a constant β value to estimate dragload on piles will not be realistic as a single β value cannot take into account of the reduction of dragload at the lower part of a pile. Based on centrifuge tests results, NP of a single <b>floating</b> <b>pile</b> was located at around 0. 75 L, where L is embedded pile length into clay stratum. This is consistent with the results as obtained by theoretical solutions, which ranged from 0. 63 - 0. 80 L. The location of NP of shielded center piles {{does not appear to be}} significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles. The measured maximum dragload of the center pile in the group at 2. 5 D and 3. 0 D spacing was only 53 % and 75 % of the measured maximum dragload of an isolated single pile, respectively. Correspondingly, the measured downdrag of the center pile was reduced to about 57 % and 80 % of that of the isolated single pile. Deduced ultimate pile capacity of shielded center pile is smaller than that of a single pile. The closer the pile spacing inside the groups, the larger is the reduction in dragload, downdrag as well as ultimate pile capacity of the center pile. This can be explained by numerical simulations of centrifuge modeling. Sacrificing piles "hang-up" the soil between the piles in the group and thus, the vertical and horizontal effective stress in the soil acting on the center pile are reduced. At the same time, smaller confining pressure at the pile tip of a center pile located inside the group causes the smaller soil stiffness and shear strength of soil, so as the ultimate pile capacity of the shielded center pile...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of four {{centrifuge}} model tests that were undertaken to investigate behavior of <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> subjected to negative skin friction (NSF) and to study effects of axial load on the load-transfer mechanism along single <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> and shielded center piles inside a group of sacrificing piles. In addition, three-dimensional numerical analyses of the centrifuge model tests were carried out with elasto-plastic slip considered at the pile-soil interface. Prior to applying load, the measured neutral plane position of the single <b>floating</b> <b>piles</b> was located at approximately the three-quarter depth level of the embedded pile length. The neutral plane elevation shifts lower down the pile shaft as the distance of pile tip above the bearing stratum decreases. Under the application of axial load, the dragload generated by excessive soil settlement decreases and is eventually eliminated. The amount of axial load for complete NSF elimination {{does not seem to}} be significantly affected by the presence of sacrificing piles, but it does increase with end-bearing stiffness of the pile. Numerical simulation revealed that the hang-up effect is not altered by the application of axial load...|$|R

The present work is a comparison, at reduced scale in the centrifuge, of the response of two simplified pile groups: a 1 × 2 vertical piles and 1 × 2 pile group with one inclined pile.
