40|$|We analyze how limited contractibility and the informational {{quality of}} audits affect {{inventory}} levels and the optimality of individual versus team-based production. We use a two-period agency {{model in which}} contractibility is limited and agents meet a fixed <b>delivery</b> <b>quota</b> each period. A costly audit is triggered in any period if the <b>delivery</b> <b>quota</b> of output for the period is not met. We show that the informativeness of the audit {{plays a crucial role}} in resolving coordination problems between agents when they are organized as a team. When the audit is perfectly informative about agent productivity and inventory levels, team-based production is optimal. The team meets its quota even though, in equilibrium, the audit never takes place. If the audit is not perfectly informative about inventory levels, we show that team-based production typically induces agents to endogenously reduce inventory levels and could even result in agents adopting a zero-inventory policy. When the audit is completely uninformative, individual production is superior to team-based production. Teams, Inventory Reduction, Agency Models...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{represents}} 10 - 15 % of wood supply costs. It {{is therefore}} important to improve efficiency in the transport system to decrease these costs. The {{aim of this}} study is to map the timber vehicle routing processes used by a sample of timber hauling contractors and to identify possible links between the vehicle routing process and service and economic variables. The study was carried out at Södra Skog in autumn 2008. 15 timber hauling contractors were sampled and interviewed about their work with timber transports. A base model for a timber vehicle routing process was mapped. The main steps in the timber vehicle routing process were: Data collection - Trucking company receives transport orders and information from transport administrators Preparatory planning - The trucking company prepares an overview of possible transport routes Main planning decisions - The trucking company takes into consideration the factors that restrict the execution Resource allocation – The trucking company takes into consideration the factors that determine the coordination of labour. The main variants of the base model were also mapped and compared with respect to their service and economic variables. The two most significant deviations from the base model concern the occurrence of follow-up of <b>delivery</b> <b>quotas</b> in Preparatory planning and certain combinations of activities in Main planning decisions. In the results of this study increasing service levels are negatively related to profitability. Follow-up of <b>delivery</b> <b>quotas</b> is linked to increasing service level but negatively related to profitability. This is because Follow-up of <b>delivery</b> <b>quotas</b> directs the trucking company to specific landings and (hence) restricts the routing planning. In Main planning decisions there are restrictions such as availability and the volumes of the landings. Inclusion of these restrictions in routing is linked to both higher service levels and profitability. Profitability is also affected by how many hours each lorry is used per year. Higher capacity utilization than 4000 hrs/yr per truck is linked to lower profitability...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of a partial {{economic}} reform of a planned economy, {{similar to the one}} that took place in Russia since 1988 and in China earlier.

We show that such a reform can result in a substantial diversion of subsidized inputs away from state firms and toward private firms even when state firms value these inputs more. The result may be a reduction of total output.

The hurricane severely affected the cane industry in the north of Belize,as a result there was the need for an implementation of a policy so that the industry would be rehabilitated and expanded {{with the assistance of the}} government. Sir Colin Thornely, the governor at that time, held a public meeting with the cane farmers in Louisville on October 10, 1955 whereby he promised to review the question of legislation so to help the organization of cane farmers to become a cooperative unit. The planter Cooperative was then formed in year of 1956 whereby it was a direct result of the Governor’s action. In December 1959, the Government, after consultation with all sides of the sugar industry, passed two important ordinances which regulated the whole sugar industry in this country. These were No. 12 of 1959 ( [...] The Sugar Industry (Control) Ordinance) setting up the Sugar Board and the licensing and <b>delivery</b> <b>quota</b> systems among other things and No.13 of 1959 (The Sugar Cane Farmers’ Association Ordinance). Therefore the Belize Cane Farmers Association was established in the year of 1959. In the year 2008 the Belize Sugar Cane Farmers Association was Fairtrade Certified. Resulting from the certification, BSCFA receives approximately $3.5bz a year in Fair-trade Premiums for sales of Fair-trade cane sugar. The organizations currently utilizes as consequence of its certification, the organization modified its body whereby innovative procedural and organizational systems were introduced which up to now it is assisting the organization itself so as to be competitive in the sugar market. Due to significant development, BSCFA has given birth to a new department in their organization which is the Environmental Department.

The success of these changes {{is due to a}} number of key factors including a property right based quota system, a single strong industry body representing the interests of fishers, an existing cost recovery process providing incentives for greater transparency and efficiency, co-operation between the government Fisheries Agency and the Industry, devolved but regulated delivery of registry services, and a third party able to facilitate the working of all parties together. A third party business integrator helped bring the Fisheries Agency and the Industry together to develop a joint programme with agreed joint funding to meet the requirements of new legislation. This occurred under a strong governance structure with government and industry as equal partners. A comprehensive plan was developed that required all parties to work together to common goals, namely the development of the processes and systems required to deliver the registry services required by the new Fisheries Act and the establishment of the devolved organisation to deliver these services. This plan operated from March 2000 through successful implementation of the Act and its associated processes and systems on 1 October 2001.

50|$|While {{it remains}} unclear how the Smallholders Party would have solved the {{problems}} resulting from their dwarf properties, the plans of the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) soon became clear. The model of Stalinist collectivization would be adopted and applied with physical force if necessary. In July 1948, government regulations allowed the seizure of larger landholdings from nagygazdák (Hungarian kulaks). These regulations enabled over 800 square kilometers of land to be confiscated, 60% of which went to recently formed farming co-operatives, the rest going to private peasants. This first serious attempt at collectivization corresponded with the first Five Year Plan, and both bore the marks of Stalinist agricultural policy. Both economic and direct police pressure were used to coerce peasants to join co-operatives, but large numbers opted instead to leave their villages. In the early 1950s, only one quarter of peasants agreed to join co-operatives. Even once collectivized, farms were subject to harsh compulsory <b>deliveries</b> (production <b>quotas</b> in physical units passed down from central planning) and incredibly low agricultural producer prices. Although individual families were allowed a small private household plot intended to serve their own personal needs, decrees passed in 1949 and 1950 limited these plots with an absolute limit of 4,300 square meters, and its output was also subject to compulsory deliveries. The Five Year Plan initially promised 11 billion forints of credit for co-operatives (later downscaled to 8 million) but by 1953, {{less than half of}} that had been made available. Without credit from the government, or any reasonable ability to earn a surplus, peasants were unable to invest in their own farms and the co-operatives began to crumble.|$|R

Despite this, Germany continued to default on her obligations. By late 1922, the German defaults on payments had grown so serious and regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission. French and Belgian delegates urged the seizure of the Ruhr to encourage the Germans to make more effort to pay, while the British supported postponing payments to facilitate the financial reconstruction of Germany.

This paper explores {{some of the}} economic implications of two laws that are widely violated: the land allotment to cotton and the imposed quota for rice. Logit and probit models are utilized to assess factors which are associated with law violations in two villages. Violators of both laws tend to be poorer, have less owned land, have fewer number of land pieces, have fewer cattle, and are located nearer the free village markets than the nonviolators. Key words: agricultural laws, Egyptian agriculture, law violation. Governmental intervention is pervasive in the agricultural sector in Egypt. Specific policies include fixed acreages allotted to certain crops, mandatory <b>quota</b> <b>deliveries</b> for some crops, protection of land and other natural resources, restrictions on intergovernorate transport of crops and livestock, food distribu-tion and pricing policies for rationed and non-rationed commodities, and health control.

40|$|In the past, in some wheat growing {{areas of}} Victoria, {{particularly}} the Wimmera, {{there has been}} almost total reliance on wheat, other enterprises filling a minor role in the farming system. With the introduction of wheat <b>delivery</b> <b>quotas</b> in April 1969, farm operators were faced with a sudden drop in income. The cost-price squeeze has aggravated the income problem. A typical Wimmera Plains wheat farm of 625 acres is small by Australian standards, but {{it has the potential}} to produce 7, 500 bushels of wheat, or more, under a fertility-maintaining rotation. In 1970 - 71, however, farms of this size had, on average, a quota of only 4, 700 bushels. The possible level of gross income from wheat has been reduced by between $ 400 and $ 3, 000 per annum, depending on the comparative profitability of alternative enterprises to wheat. The aim of the study was to investigate two important aspects of the farm adjustment problem on the Wimmera Plains; firstly, the best use of resources released from wheat production, and secondly, the potential for adjustment towards optimal resource combinations. A sample of 20 farms, chosen at random from a population of 129, was surveyed in May and June, 1970. The data collected, together with information supplied by the Victorian Department of Agriculture, provided farm planning coefficients. Because of the relatively homogeneous nature of farms with respect to resource complements and enterprise possibilities, the representative farm model approach was considered to be satisfactory for the examination of farm adjustment possibilities on the Wimmera Plains. Using a representative model, linear programming was used to generate profit-maximising farm plans. Variable price programming was used to study the effect of commodity price changes on income. Because of the dominating importance of feed grains in plans, and uncertainty about their prices, enterprise combinations were studied at both "high" and "low" feed-grain prices. To substantiate the results generated for the representative farm model, five of the sample farms were studied individually. When only the "traditional" enterprises (cereals and sheep) were considered, planning results suggested that the five course rotation, pasture, fallow, crop, fallow, crop, with winter-lambing Merino ewes, is the maximum profit plan at both "high" and "low" feed grain prices. Wheat is grown to the level of quota and barley is grown on the remaining cropped area. Income from livestock is minor relative to crop income, providing only 15 to 30 per cent of total gross margin. However, several alternative (or "new') enterprises which are not vet commonly practised in the area were found to offer considerable promise. Oilseed crops, especially oilseed rape, are profitable alternatives to barley, particularly at low feed-grain prices. Even at the current relatively high feed grain prices, and assuming a conservative yield, rapeseed has the potential to lift income from the 625 acre representative farm model by up to $ 700 per annum. More experience is required with oilseed crops in the area before firm recommendations can be made. Beef cattle, grain feeding of beef, and pigs, can also contribute to increased farm income. Cattle compete directly with sheep for feed, but pigs can be integrated into the existing farming system using farm-grown barley and surplus operator labour. The returns to capital investment in the cattle and pig enterprises were found to be favourable, especially in the case of pigs. If the necessary capital is to be borrowed, however, it is unlikely that there will be surplus disposable income from cattle enterprises during a ten-year repayment period. Gains to the individual farmer from wheat quota negotiability were investigated. The five case-study farms were considered as a "mini-market" for wheat quota under perfect competition. Assuming that the five operators bought or sold quota in order to maximise their income, the average theoretical gain per farm, from negotiability, was between $ 100 and $ 200 per annum, depending on the price of barley. In the theoretical quota market seven thousand bushels of wheat quota were exchanged between the five farms. The return to labour and management which is possible on the typical 625 acre Wimmera Plains farm was found to be below an "acceptable" level of $ 3, 500 per annum. However, at current land values, which have fallen substantially since 1968, the purchase or lease of additional land by typical farmers seems to be profitable. Results indicated that the machinery and labour capacity of the "typical" 625 acre property was sufficient to effectively farm more than 1, 000 acres. Eleven per cent of the 129 farms in the Wimmera study area were found to be smaller than 500 acres in size. For such farms, additional land as well as additional quota would probably be necessary for viability, at least at low feed-grain prices.

The said stage marks an acceleration of the processes involved in technical advancement of agriculture. The organizational form of activities aimed at fostering that advancement in respect of individual peasant farms are the agricultural circles. The latter have at their disposal substantial financial means accumulated {{by way of the}} reimbursement of the differences in the prices of agricultural produce <b>quota</b> <b>deliveries</b> and the free-market prices within the so-called Agriculture Development Fund. A telling illustration of the means of this Fund is their share in investments in individual peasant farms which amounts, at present, almost to one fourth of the total. Proceeding with his deliberations, the author examines regional differences in the rate of accumulating means of Agriculture Development Fund. However, uneven their regional distribution — says the author — this fact has not resulted in a decrease of the effectiveness of their utilization. The next problem tackled is that of the degree of utilization of the means derived from the Find. The searching analysis of the matter, considered from the viewpoint of the supply of machines and implements and of the demand for them {{on the part of the}} agricultural circles is worth of attention. The concluding part of the article is devoted to a justification of postulates concerning the new trends of investments to be financed from the Agriculture Development Fund.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{integrated}} modeling has become a preferred tool in the petroleum industry to manage the value chain of different assets. It is slowly replacing the traditional modeling approach that treats each petroleum asset model separately. Having different discipline models and applications in a single platform will ensure more consistency of the value chain from one asset to another. Integrated modeling also enables engineers to optimize assets, both locally and globally, using an automatic approach. Coupling of different petroleum assets entails transferring and combining petroleum streams from one asset to the others. Stream conversion is a key requirement in integrated modeling because petroleum assets usually have their own fluid model, and it is rare to have a single common fluid model in both the subsurface and surface simulation models. This thesis investigates different stream conversion methods and provides important technologies for integrating different petroleum assets into an integrated asset model. These stream conversions {{are expected to have}} highly accurate results and reduce the computational time. Reservoir engineers have utilized both compositional and black-oil reservoir simulations for many years. Due to the CPU-time consideration, the EOS model used in a compositional simulation is normally limited to 6 - 10 components, a so-called lumped EOS model. We propose a delumping method to generate detailed compositional streams from either black-oil or compositional (lumped-EOS) reservoir simulations, performed as a simple post-processing step. These methods are based on a set of phase-specific and pressure-dependent split factors. The reservoir simulation phase behavior can be approximated by a PVT depletion experiment, such as the CCE depletion experiment. We have used this approach to develop the blackoil and compositional delumping method applied to the reservoir simulation output. The split factors are generated from simulated depletion PVT experiments using a detailed-EOS model. Delumping is performed phase-wise at the well-connection level, for each time step of the reservoir simulator. For gas injection processes, the amount of injection gas is estimated from stream information and, accordingly, removed from the stream before applying the phase-specific pressure-dependent split factors. We propose another conversion procedure to convert one fluid model stream to another fluid model stream in which the heaviest fractions have different component grouping. This procedure is called the two-step gamma distribution conversion. It consists of two steps: (1) splitting the heavy component into single carbon number (SCN) characterization and (2) lumping from the SCN characterization model to the destination fluid model stream. SCN characterization has been proposed as a generic accounting characterization that contains a SCN component up to C 80 for a normal reservoir fluid and C 200 for a heavy reservoir fluid. To obtain the best result, it is recommended that this conversion be performed phase-wise at the well-connection level. The implementation of the three proposed conversion methods has been demonstrated using a hypothetical integrated petroleum asset model. We believe that the combination of our proposed methods will provide important advances in the integrated asset modeling. The second section of this thesis addresses some key reservoir and production issues related to gas and condensate recovery from Khuff reservoirs in the Middle East - namely Ghawar Khuff, North Field and South Pars. These fields represent somewhere between 1, 000 and 2, 000 Tcf initial gas in place, with 30 to 70 billion barrels of condensate in place. We apply engineering methods and reservoir simulation to quantify the expected performance of Khuff gas condensate fields for a realistic range of geologic description, petrophysical and fluid properties, and production facilities based on published information. We review key data for reservoir and production design, summarizing the impact of geologic zonation, areal and vertical communication, mean permeability and its variation, relative permeability, water encroachment, and fluid composition on field performance. Because most commercial development projects involving gas sales export are based on <b>delivery</b> contract <b>quotas</b> (DCQs) of 1 - 1. 5 bcf/D for up to 25 years, well-average plateau length and rate-time is used as a primary measure of performance. We try to describe the interplay of reservoir and production-facilities performance on overall design of field deliverability and total well requirements. Other production issues not considered in our work but with significant impact on Khuff development strategy include gathering system design, rate metering, platform vs. onshore processing, and single-phase vs two-phase pipeline flow. Economics are not considered in our evaluation. We estimate deliverability impairment from condensate blockage using relative permeability models that reflect the impact of velocity (capillary number improvement and inertial effect). The velocity effect is particularly important in Khuff wells because of the high-k, low-h layers with unusually-high flow velocities and convergent flow. Layer vertical and areal connectivity can {{have a profound effect on}} water encroachment. When sufficient lateral continuity exists, even small aquifers can result in rapid water encroachment through thin, high-permeability zones. This has been studied and is shown to have a lesser effect in Khuff reservoirs. PhD i petroleumsteknologi og anvendt geofysikkPhD in Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysic...|$|R
