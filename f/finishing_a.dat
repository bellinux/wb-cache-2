5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> zone with 50 or more rings.

5|$|Coulson {{was called}} into the England {{national}} C team in September 2010 for a match against Wales, but injury prevented him from making his debut. In February 2012, he received a second call up, being selected in the squad to face Italy in the 2011–13 International Challenge Trophy on 28 February. Coulson started to make his England C debut, playing the entire match as he and fellow winger Matty Blair played well on the flanks, the match <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> 1–1 home draw. He finished his England C career with two caps, earned in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton won the race, passing Nico Rosberg in {{the later}} stages, and thereby secured his third Drivers' Championship, as Sebastian Vettel {{finished}} third. An incident-packed race saw only twelve cars reach the finish line, with Max Verstappen repeating his best result {{of the season in}} fourth and Jenson Button <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> season-best sixth. After starting in damp conditions, both Red Bull drivers were initially able to challenge the Mercedes for the lead, but later dropped back as the track dried, with Daniil Kvyat retiring after a crash and Daniel Ricciardo eventually finishing tenth.|$|E

5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford slipped out of the play-off places in the final few weeks of the season, <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E

5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> {{stage in the}} top 15; {{additional}} points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. It was crossed twice by the riders, for the first climbing of the mountain, Italian Franco Vona was the first over the climb, while Franco Chioccioli was first over the second passing. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1967 were eligible for it.|$|E

5|$|In the 2003–04 season, Rehman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on 23 September 2003 in a 1–0 defeat away to Wigan Athletic {{in the second}} round of the Football League Cup, coming on as a substitute for Junichi Inamoto after 57 minutes. Six days later, he was sent on loan to Brighton & Hove Albion of the Second Division, initially for one month until November. He scored on his debut for the club on 30 September, concluding a 3–1 away win at Rushden & Diamonds.

5|$|Ladas {{was then}} matched against Isinglass, the Triple Crown winner of 1893, in the £10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 5 July. The race {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} including the Prince of Wales (who supported Isinglass) and the Queen's cousin George, Duke of Cambridge (who favoured Ladas). The field also included Raeburn, the only horse to have beaten Isinglass, Ravensbury, who had won impressively at Royal Ascot, and Bullingdon, who had recovered from the bout of coughing that had reportedly affected him at Epsom. The early pace was slow, and Watts held Ladas up behind the leaders before moving into the lead just over a furlong out. He was immediately challenged, however, and overtaken inside the final furlong by both Isinglass and Bullingdon. Isinglass prevailed by a short head with Ladas, who was eased in the closing stages, <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> well-beaten third. Ladas appeared to be perfectly sound after the race, and the only explanation offered (by The Sportsman) was that the slow pace (the winning time was 1:48.4) had produced a false result.|$|E

Despite missing 10 games from his suspension, Bertuzzi finished the 2001–02 season third in league-scoring with 85 points, behind Näslund and Calgary Flames forward Jarome Iginla. His 1.18 points-per-game average ranked second in the league behind Mario Lemieux, who played 48 fewer games than Bertuzzi. He also improved his plus-minus rating by 39 points from the previous season, <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> career-high +21. Although the Canucks were the league's highest scoring team, they finished with the final seed in the West for the 2002 playoffs, ranking eighth in their conference. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Bertuzzi recorded four points during the series.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2012, Colbeck {{signed a}} two-year deal with Grimsby Town.

On Boxing Day 2012, Colbeck provided 3 assists and scored directly from a corner in the 4–1 Lincolnshire derby win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. On 8 January 2013 Colbeck was fined by The Football Association over comments he made on his Twitter account.|$|E
5|$|Rankine {{missed an}} 87th-minute penalty for York away to Kettering, with Reed scoring the team's goal in a 1–1 draw. Jonathan Smith {{scored in the}} first half for York at home to league-leaders Crawley, who {{equalised}} in the second half, with the match <b>finishing</b> <b>a</b> 1–1 draw. Racchi was released from his contract with immediate effect after requesting a transfer, having failed to establish himself in the team. York beat Newport 2–1 at home, with Rankine opening the scoring before assisting Reed for the second goal. McGurk picked up an ankle ligament injury in this match, which ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season. York suffered their first defeat at home since December 2010 after losing 2–1 to Tamworth, in which Constantine scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute. Having not made any appearances for the club, Chippendale was recalled by Huddersfield. Reed scored the only goal to give York a 1–0 victory at home to Luton. Young was recalled from his loan at Altrincham after Parslow suffered a head injury during the match against Luton.|$|E
