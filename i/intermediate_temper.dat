Of {{course the}} inquiry into this {{branch of the}} hill {{influence}} is partly complicated with that into its operation on domestic habits and personal character, of which hereafter: {{but there is one}} curious witness borne to the general truth of the foregone conclusions, by an apparently slight, yet very significant circumstance in art. We have seen, in the preceding volume, how difficult it was sometimes to distinguish between honest painters, who truly chose to paint sacred subjects because they loved them, and the affected painters, who took sacred subjects for their own pride's sake, or for merely artistical delight. Amongst other means of arriving at a conclusion in this matter, there is one helpful test which may be applied to their various works, almost as easily and certainly as a foot-rule could be used to measure their size; and which remains an available test down to the date of the rise of the Claudesque landscape schools. Nearly all the genuine religious painters use steep mountain distances. All the merely artistical ones, or those of <b>intermediate</b> <b>temper,</b> in proportion as they lose the religious element, use flat or simply architectural distances. Of course the law is liable to many exceptions, chiefly dependent on the place of birth and early associations of painters; but its force is, I think, strongly shown in this;--that, though the Flemish painters never showed any disposition to paint, for its own sake, other scenery than of their own land (compare Vol. III. Chap. XIII. § 20), the sincerely religious ones continually used Alpine distances, bright with snow. In like manner Giotto, Perugino, Angelico, the young Raphael, and John Bellini, always, if, with any fitness to their subject, they can introduce them, use craggy or blue mountain distances, and this with definite expression of love towards them; Leonardo, conventionally, as feeling they were necessary for his sacred subjects, while yet his science and idealism had destroyed his mountain sincerity; Michael Angelo, wholly an artist, and Raphael in later years, show no love of mountains whatever, while the relative depths of feeling in Tintoret, Titian, and Veronese, are precisely measurable by their affection to mountains. Tintoret, though born in Venice, yet, because capable of the greatest reaches of feeling, is the first of the old painters who ever drew mountain detail rightly:[109] Titian, though born in Cadore, and recurring to it constantly, yet being more worldly-minded, uses his hills somewhat more conventionally, though, still in his most deeply felt pictures, such as the St. Jerome, in the Brera, giving to the rocks and forests a consummate nobleness; and Veronese, in his gay grasp of the outside aspects of the world, contentedly includes his philosophy within porticos and pillars, or at the best overshadows it with a few sprays of laurel.|$|E
40|$|For life {{tests on}} PVC-U pipes Woehler curves were {{determined}} {{at a constant}} R-value (R= 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6). Investigations include the effect of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>tempering</b> at 60 C. The hard- and software applied for the dynamical tests allow not only the record of strengths {{but at the same}} time also the record of sample deformation. From the measured hysteresis values the beginning of the damage, e. g. by crack formation, can be derived. Hysteresis values are more sensitive to starting damages than deformation values. Parameters effecting hysteresis and crack formation during test conditions are discussed. The obtained results can be used for the dimensioning of plastic pipes.

40|$|International audienceThe Ugi {{reaction}} {{is one of}} the most famous multicomponent couplings, and its efficiency is still explained by the original mechanism suggested by Ugi in the 60 s. This article aims to present a thorough theoretical study of this reaction. It describes how the imine is activated and how the new stereogenic center is formed. Our calculations strongly suggest alternatives to some commonly accepted features, such as the reversibility of the <b>intermediate</b> steps, and <b>temper</b> the nature of the driving force of the reaction...|$|R
40|$|A mother alloy of 10 % Cr and 90 % Cu was {{prepared}} by sintering. This was alloyed with the Cu melt and Cu-Cr alloys containing about 0. 5 % Cr was obtained. These alloys could be deformed easily {{in both the}} hot and cold states. By measuring the hardness change, age-hardening properties of cast alloys were studied, which were quenched from 950 deg and aged at 300 to 700 deg for 1 hour. The maximum hardness was obtained with the tempering temperature of 500 deg. For the temperature of solution-treatment, 950 deg was insufficient and that above 1000 deg necessary. For the tempering time, a treatment at 500 deg for 1 hr. or at 450 deg for 3 hrs. yielded the maximum hardness. As for the properties for electrical conductors, 3 kinds of wires (diam. 2 mm.) were made: (1) after cold-drawn to 2 mm., solution-treated, quenched, and then tempered (500 deg, 1 hr.); (2) after quenching, cold-drawn (75 % reduction) to 2 mm. and tempered (500 deg, 1 hr.); and (3) after quenching, cold-drawn (81 %) to <b>intermediate</b> diameter, <b>tempered</b> (500 deg, 1 hr.) and then cold-drawn (88 %) again. Properties obtained for the 3 kinds, respectively, were as follows: conductivity 91, 90, and 86 %. Tensile strength and strength for electrical conductivity are given...|$|R
40|$|CAF process {{combines}} creep and {{precipitation hardening}} which are {{highly dependent on}} time and temperature. The aging cycle relax the stresses induced during the loading phase. At {{the end of the}} process stress relaxation induces shape changes in the part but significant spring back is observed (about 70 %). Usually CAF cycles for 7 XXX alloys use times around 20 h and temperatures in the range of 120 °C to 190 °C. In the present work CAF tests were performed using the alloy 7050 in an <b>intermediate</b> condition named <b>Temper</b> to Age Forming (TAF). Using the alloy 7050 -TAF resulted in significant process time reduction. From TAF temper, only 8 hours are necessary to achieve properties comparable to T 74. Coupons were submitted to CAF in two levels of initial stress, 190 MPa and 290 MPa, resulting in spring back values of 70 % and 60 % respectively. In addition, constant load creep tests were performed in the same stress levels and time of CAF tests to find the creep strain values. Creep tests performed under 190 MPa resulted in strain values around 0, 1 % after 8 h. On the other hand creep tests performed under 290 MPa failed after 7 h with creep strain values of 1, 7 %. Results obtained are close to that found in previous studies and it is possible to conclude that the use of alloy 7050 in TAF condition allows CAF to be done in 8 hours, since the initial stress is lower than 290 MPa...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The phase transformations during {{continuous}} cooling {{from the}} two-phase α+β range in Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy has been determined. Design/methodology/approach: The phase transformations during continuous cooling of investigated alloy was elaborated using an L 78 R. I. T. A dilatometer of the German Linseis Company. The microstructure of investigated alloy cooled from the two-phase α+β range was examinated by a light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT. The measurements of hardness were {{performed with the}} Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: The relationship between cooling rate and microstructure morphology, hardness as well as dilatation effects has been determined. Research limitations/implications: The results {{will be used for}} the interpretation of phase transformations occurring at continuous cooling and at tempering from as-quenched state of the investigated alloy. Currently, the investigations of the kinetics phase transformation at continuous heating from as-quenched state will help to performed the Continuous-Heating-Transformation diagrams (CHT). These diagrams show the possibility of the regulation of the progress of successive (<b>intermediate)</b> transformations at <b>tempering</b> and thus influence the final alloy properties, including their hardness and fracture toughness. It is expected that the determination of final mechanical properties by means of regulating the progress of successive transformations occurring during heating from the as-quenched state is possible also in the Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy. Practical implications: The obtained results will be applied for the optimization of the heat treatment technology and for achieving the required mechanical properties of the Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy. Originality/value: The obtained results, supported in the future by additional cooling curves, will be used {{for the development of the}} original, full CCT diagram of the Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy cooled continuously from the twophase α+β range...|$|R
