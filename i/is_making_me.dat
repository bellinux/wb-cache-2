2500|$|Scherzinger's {{television}} and music video impact {{has also been}} acknowledged in pop culture where she is known for her music videos, which often incorporate raunchy outfits and dance breaks. Critics generally favor Scherzinger's intricate choreography. She is considered a sex symbol through her music videos. Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance ability, respectively calling her [...] "one of the best live performers I've ever seen" [...] and [...] "if you want {{an example of how}} you do it right... its Nicole. It's focus, performance, vocals...". American recording artist Lady Gaga has been influenced by Scherzinger's role in the Pussycat Dolls saying, [...] "There's something that's very humbling about being able to work with a powerhouse group like that. Probably the biggest influence they've had on me <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> want to be a better writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, the album's theme {{speaks of}} girls' experiences. The album was widely {{addressed}} a personal album, speaking {{about what it}} is like to be [...] "a girl like me"—things that girls Rihanna's age at the time were going through—as well as every aspect of her life: people being cheated on, falling in and out of love, people hating on you, having feelings towards a guy and partying. [...] "SOS" [...] tells about a guy who gives the girl a feeling that is very overwhelming—he drives the girl crazy, and she needs someone to rescue her from it. [...] "Kisses Don't Lie" [...] talks about a girl who's in love with a guy but is stuck between an ultimatum because she's afraid of getting hurt. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] documents the decay of a relationship when another person starts cheating. According to Rihanna, [...] "I'm referred to as a murderer in that song, meaning I'm taking this guy's life by hurting him, cheating on him. He knows, and it makes him feel so bad. It's killing him to know that another guy <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> happy." [...] "We Ride" [...] talks about how a guy promises a girl that they will be together forever, while the girl describes moments which he did things that could tear them apart. The lyrics of [...] "Dem Haters" [...] portray a message about how [...] "haters" [...] try to bring people down and recommends excluding them from your life. [...] "Final Goodbye" [...] talks about a woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with a man but feels that she needs to reveal a secret before moving on. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] continues the theme of love in a similar vein to [...] "SOS", however, [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] portrays a message about being in love, whereas [...] "SOS" [...] talks about having an overwhelming feeling towards a guy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pie," [...] {{proceeded}} Mrs. McCall, in her platform voice. She stopped again abruptly. [...] "Whatever is the matter, Washington? You <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> feel nervous." ...|$|R
60|$|ACIS. I don't {{want to be}} hard on {{the poor}} devils; but they <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> feel uneasy in my inside. I never had such a {{sensation}} before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Send it along," [...] was the {{enthusiastic}} reply. [...] "What a constitution I must have, doctor! The smell of that cooking outside <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> ravenous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Helen, do {{come and}} listen to Captain Griffiths! He <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> feel quite creepy. There are secrets about, it seems, {{and he wants to}} know all about Mr. Lessingham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope {{they have}} supper ready {{by the time}} we get there," [...] said Whopper after a period of silence. [...] "This transit <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> as hungry as a bear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{become more}} of a mystery than ever," [...] she declared. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> even curious. Tell me really why you have paid us this visit from the clouds?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sure enough, {{the woman}} had a natural birth. When her husband came to the synagogue to {{announce}} the [...] "miracle," [...] Abba Shaul complained, [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> into an Admor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Flo," [...] she said, [...] "you <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> {{almost as}} silly as you are, and that capote--it's the prettiest I have seen you put on--is burning. Sit still, or I'll pinch you--hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said my mother, [...] "the {{touch of}} the old keys on my fingers <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> sentimental—you wouldn't like to see me reduced to the tears of old age?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} thing to do," [...] {{answered}} Giant. [...] "Come on," [...] he added. [...] "Staying here <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> nervous. If another tree should come down we might be buried alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} of him, and he <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> unhappy," [...] said Clarissa, bursting into tears. [...] "But I don't know why you should {{say that he is}} a liar, and dishonest, and everything that is bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, pray do not, dear grandmamma," [...] eagerly exclaimed Henrietta; [...] "I do beg {{you will}} {{let us take}} it. It will <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> at home {{directly}} to let me be useful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say it if {{you don't}} like it; but you can't guess the {{pleasure}} it gives me. I could hardly tell at first what <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> so happy when I awoke this morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> {{say what}} I {{did not mean}} to say," [...] he exclaimed passionately, [...] "at least not now; but you do more than guess, you know--you know that I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{feel as if}} it {{were burning}} into me,' thought Siegmund abstractedly. 'It is {{certainly}} consuming some part of me. Perhaps it <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> ill.' Meanwhile, perversely, he gave his face and his hot black hair to the sun.|$|E
6000|$|America <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> {{very anxious}} just know. If they {{compromise}} {{in the north}} it is a moral death, but a merely physical dissolution of the States would {{be followed by a}} resurrection 'in honor,' and I should not fear. What are you painting? ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{broke off}} with a laugh. [...] "We have lost the pins. Well, hope away! But, remember, you take the whole responsibility." [...] Maxwell pulled out his watch. [...] "Isn't lunch nearly ready? This {{prosperity}} <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> hungry, and it seems about a year since breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With your {{excursions}} {{into the}} past and the future you <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> feel dreadfully like an instalment of a serial novel," [...] protested Ronnie; [...] "we have now got to 'synopsis of earlier chapters.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Helène," [...] he said, [...] "you <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> very happy, {{but there}} is one thing which I must ask you, and which you must forgive me for asking. This {{entanglement}} of which you speak {{has nothing to do with}} Mr. Sabin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, papa," [...] said Margaret. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> {{angry with}} myself for my folly. It {{is much better}} for Richard himself, and for us all, {{as well as the}} town. Think how long we have wished for Mr. Wilmot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{picture is}} coming on very well, Mr. Osborne says. I know [...] he <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> look far too pretty in it, {{although}} her [...] persists in saying he can't do me justice. He {{is going to}} [...] send it to some great exhibition when finished, but he says [...] he will make a little water-color copy for me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good gracious, Arthur--Doyce and Clennam!' cried that lady, 'who {{would have}} ever thought of seeing such a sight as this and pray excuse a wrapper for upon my word I really never and a faded check too which is worse but our little friend <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me,</b> not that I need mind {{mentioning}} it to you for you must {{know that there are}} such things a skirt, and having arranged that a trying on should take place after breakfast is the reason though I wish not so badly starched.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do,' said Checco, 'and I wear {{a coat of}} mail. The fear of {{assassination}} {{has been}} haunting me for weeks. Oh God, it is terrible! I could bear an open foe. I have courage as much as anyone; but this perpetual suspense! I swear to you it <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> a coward. I cannot turn {{the corner of a}} street without thinking that my death may be on the other side; I cannot go through a dark corridor at night without thinking that over there in the darkness my murderer may be waiting for me. I start at the slightest sound, the banging of a door, a sudden step. And I awake in the night with a cry, sweating. I cannot stand it I shall go mad if it continues. What can I do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you were}} right in warning me. He must needs think I worked in the parish for his sake; and one fine day, as I was walking home, he joined company, and before I knew where I <b>was</b> he <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> an offer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every time {{he comes}} in he robs me," [...] soliloquised Israel, dolefully; [...] "with an air all the time, too, as if he <b>were</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> presents. If he thinks me such a very {{sensible}} young man, why not let me take care of myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} have, Joseph. You don't fancy I can remain silent with such goings {{on in my}} house, and not attempt to {{understand}} them. What {{have you been doing}} to yourself? Why don't you answer? Can't you see you <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> very nervous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Dad, {{a little}} thing like a girl {{sticking}} close {{to her mother and}} room doesn't stop Mr. Chase. I think he's crazy. Anyway, he's a most persistent fool. I want to be charitable, because the man swears he loves me, and maybe he does, but he <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> nervous. I don't sleep. I'm afraid to be in my room at night. I've gone to mother's room. He's always hanging round. Bold! Why, that isn't the thing to call Mr. Chase. He's absolutely without a sense of decency. He bribes our servants. He comes into our patio. Think of that! He makes the most ridiculous excuses. He bothers mother to death. I feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound. And I daren't peep out." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} to make of Margaret, and I wish you would come down and see her. The good-humour which I have noticed in her of late has given way to a curious irritability. She is so restless that she cannot keep still for a moment. Even when she is sitting down her body moves in a manner that is almost convulsive. I am {{beginning}} to think that the strain from which she suffered is bringing on some nervous disease, and I am really alarmed. She walks about the house in a peculiarly aimless manner, up and down the stairs, in and out of the garden. She has grown suddenly much more silent, and the look has come back to her eyes which they had when first we brought her down here. When I beg her to tell me what is troubling her, she says: 'I'm afraid that something is going to happen.' She will not or cannot explain what she means. The last few weeks have set my own nerves on edge, so that I do not know how much of what I observe is real, and how much is due to my fancy; but I wish you would come and put a little courage into me. The oddness of it all <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> uneasy, and I am seized with preposterous terrors. I don't know what there is in Haddo that inspires me with this unaccountable dread. He is always present to my thoughts. I seem to see his dreadful eyes and his cold, sensual smile. I wake up at night, my heart beating furiously, with the consciousness that something quite awful has happened.|$|E
6000|$|... 30. The Duchess of Ormond {{found me}} out to-day, {{and made me}} dine with her. Lady Masham is still expecting. She has had a cruel cold. I could not finish my letter last post {{for the soul of}} me. Lord Bolingbroke has had my papers these six weeks, and done nothing to them. Is Tisdall yet in the world? I propose writing controversies, to get a name with posterity. The Duke of Ormond will not be over these three or four days. I desire to make him join with me in {{settling}} all right among our people. I have ordered the Duchess to let me have an hour with the Duke at his first coming, to give him a true state of persons and things. I believe the Duke of Shrewsbury will hardly be declared your Governor yet; at least, I think so now; but resolutions alter very often. The Duke of Hamilton gave me a pound of snuff to-day, admirable good. I wish DD had it, and Ppt too, if she likes it. It cost me {{a quarter of an hour}} of his politics, which I was forced to hear. Lady Orkney(10) <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> a writing-table of her own contrivance, and a bed nightgown. She is perfectly kind, like a mother. I think the devil was in it the other day, that I should talk to her of an ugly squinting cousin of hers, and the poor lady herself, you know, squints like a dragon. The other day we had a long discourse with her about love; and she told us a saying of her sister Fitz-Hardinge,(11) which I thought excellent, that in men, desire begets love, and in women, love begets desire. We have abundance of our old criers(12) still hereabouts. I hear every morning your women with the old satin and taffeta, etc., the fellow with old coats, suits or cloaks. Our weather is abominable of late. We have not two tolerable days in twenty. I have lost money again at ombre, with Lord Orkney and others; yet, after all, this year I have lost but three-and-twenty shillings; so that, considering card money, I am no loser.|$|E

60|$|I believe I was {{the butt}} {{of more than one}} jest for my aloofness, though I could not hear {{distinctly}} for the noise they made. I commanded some French cognac, and kept my eye on the rector, and the sight of him <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> dangerous.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>me</b> cross. [...] "Where do I live?" [...] I retorted. [...] "Why, in this cottage. You don't think I've got {{up early}} and come from a {{distance}} {{to listen to this}} cow? Don't talk so much. Do you know whose cow it is, or don't you?" ...|$|R
