500|$|However, {{during a}} concert in The Netherlands, Moody didn't show up to perform the first song, which were sung by Tommy Vext, with Moody saying he was running [...] "a little bit late". Vext also sung a second song during the set {{later in the evening}} whilst Moody walked off stage. During the show all of the members left the stage for long periods on several occasions, and Hook also threw his guitar down and walked offstage at one point. During the set, Moody said that “there is no other singer for Five Finger Death Punch”, and then later said [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> show with Five Finger Death Punch" [...] before making a slit-throat gesture. Bathory shortly after the show tweeted that the events that transpired were [...] "not a {{publicity}} stunt." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and the yearning for a long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|Nixon ran for Governor of California against {{incumbent}} Pat Brown, and {{was defeated}} handily, leading {{the media to}} label him as a [...] "loser." [...] This defeat was widely {{believed to be the}} end of his career; in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon famously blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> press conference." [...] In September, the New York Post published an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses. He moved to New York, joining the Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon law firm, and regrouped, considering but decided against a run for president in 1964, beginning to plan for a 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E
500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights. Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus. It's got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn't for boxing, I wouldn't have my beautiful wife and family". Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.|$|E

500|$|The Canadiens {{failed to}} repeat {{their success in}} 1993–94, as the team was {{eliminated}} from the playoffs by the Bruins in seven games. Montreal's loss in Game 6 was the last playoff game ever played at the Montreal Forum. The team missed the playoffs entirely in 1994–95, {{the first time in}} 25 years the Canadiens did not qualify, and the third time in 55 seasons. Montreal rebounded to make the playoffs in 1995–96, but the future of the team was altered on December 2, 1995, when the Canadiens were embarrassed 11–1 by the Red Wings. Patrick Roy allowed nine goals on 26 shots before he was pulled in the second period to mock cheers from the Montreal crowd. Roy was furious, and felt that head coach Mario Tremblay deliberately left him in to be embarrassed. After reaching the bench, he moved past Tremblay to Canadiens President Ronald Corey, who was seated in the first row, and declared, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> game in Montreal." ...|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Rose has a dream {{where she}} hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay, where a {{holographic}} image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> chance to say it: Rose Tyler—"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to know where she is, leading {{to the events of}} [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E
500|$|Harsh {{restrictions}} were imposed on Prussia, {{such as a}} massive indemnity of one hundred and twenty million francs and the quartering of troops. At the time, one hundred and twenty million francs was equivalent to the entire yearly budget of Prussia. As the perceived symbol of Prussia's former grandeur and pride, the French occupation of Prussia had a particularly devastating effect upon Louise, as the queen endured personal insults– Napoleon himself callously called her [...] "the only real man in Prussia". The queen recognized that her adopted country depended on her for moral strength, {{and as a consequence}} Louise regained her old sense of optimism, often taking time to prepare their eldest son for his future role as king. In the following few years Louise supported the reforming efforts of government carried out by Stein and Hardenberg, {{as well as those of}} Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, to reorganize the army. After the disaster at Tilsit, Louise was instrumental in Stein's reappointment (the king had previously dismissed him), telling Frederick William [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> hope. A great heart, an encompassing mind, perhaps he knows remedies that are hidden to us." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, [...] "Dope" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock lament, in the vein of Irish folk ballad rue. Rolling Stone said that [...] "Dope" [...] reveals a [...] "dark mood" [...] of Gaga as she plays {{the piano and}} utters the lyrics. She begins the song with intoxicated, slur-like vocals and the lines, [...] "I promise this drink <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend". The composition and the musical elements associated with the track resembled Gaga's own song, [...] "Hair", from Born This Way (2011) with its contemplative nature, and singer Rihanna's 2013 single, [...] "Stay", with the piano driven melody and the powerful vocals. It is more like theatrical music, but devoid of any genre. There is not much instrumentation accompanying the singer's vocals, except for piano sounds and distant synths, making Gaga's singing {{the focal point of}} [...] "Dope". In order to give the production an intimate feeling and make it emotional, Rubin did not apply any pitch correction to Gaga's vocals, as noted by Jon Pareles from The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|Local and {{national}} Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election. Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race. The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the {{office as a}} stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own {{lack of interest in}} being California's governor. Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics. Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed {{to be the end of}} his political career. In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>last</b> press conference". The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's [...] entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon". Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air, and public sympathy for Nixon grew.|$|E
