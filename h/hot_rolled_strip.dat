40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} demand of higher quality <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>strips,</b> flatness defects occurred on the strips during the cooling process on the run-out table have received significant attention and {{should be considered in}} the online shape control model. Non-uniform temperature distribution and cooling across the strip width are the main reasons why the strip becomes unflatten after cooling process although the <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> flat at the finishing mill. A thermal, microstructural and mechanical coupling analysis model for predicting flatness change of steel strip during the run-out table cooling process was established using ABAQUS Finite Element Software. In this model, Esaka phase transformation kinetics model was employed to calculate the phase transformation, and coupled with temperature calculation by means of the user subroutine program HETVAL. An elasto-plasticity constitutive model of the material, in which conventional elastic and plastic strains, thermal strain, phase transformation strain and transformation induced plastic strain were taken into account, was derived and realized using the user subroutine program UMAT. The conclusion that the flatness of the steel strip will develop to edge wave defect under the functions of the different thermal and microstructural behaviors across strip width direction during the run-out table cooling procedure was acquired through the analysis results of this model. The calculation results of this analysis model agree with the actual measurements and observation, therefore this model has a high accuracy. To better control the flatness quality of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> steel <b>strip,</b> the shape compensation control strategy of slight center wave rolling is proposed based on the analysis result.

40|$|Purpose: Present {{work was}} aimed at {{developing}} welding technology applicable for <b>hot</b> and cold <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> made of high alloy martensitic steels. Electron beam (EB) and TIG welding processes parameters were worked out for strips of the 2 N 11 K 13 H 3 M, N 19 M 4 T, H 11 N 10 M 2 T and PH 13 - 8 steel grades (unconventional maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steel grades). Design/methodology/approach: The heats of the steels were laboratory vacuum melted, forged and then <b>hot</b> and cold <b>rolled.</b> Welding process parameters were experimentally selected. Quality of the welds was evaluated by several non-destructive techniques and metallographic examination. Hardness distribution and tensile properties of welded strips were analyzed, and {{post weld heat treatment}} was proposed. Findings: All four steel grades studied were suitable for the electron beam welding and optimum process parameters were worked out for the 3 mm strips. The suitability of the steels to welding using the TIG process was tested with 1. 5 mm strips. Apart from the high cobalt maraging steel, which was not available in the form of thin strips, the other steels were welded successfully in TIG process. After welding, strength of the steels could be largely restored by full heat treatment. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed on weld microstructure evolution, affected by welding processes, to improve fracture properties of welds.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ferritic}} rolling strategy {{allows for the}} production of two different hot strip grades, a "soft " and a "hard " hot strip. The "soft " <b>hot</b> <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> in the upper ferrite region and a sufficiently high coiling temperature ensures direct recrystallisation in the coil. The "hard " <b>hot</b> <b>strip</b> is <b>rolled</b> at relatively lower temperatures in the ferrite temperature region and exhibits a strained microstructure with a desirable rolling texture. Furthermore, these ferritic <b>rolled</b> <b>hot</b> <b>strips</b> can be used as initial strip for subsequent cold rolling. The current investigation focuses {{on the development of the}} recrystalli-sation texture of cold rolled and annealed ferritic <b>rolled</b> <b>hot</b> <b>strip</b> for different cold reductions. For this purpose "soft " and "hard " hot strips were produced on a laboratory hot rolling mill. These <b>strips</b> were cold <b>rolled</b> with a total reduction of 40 to 80 % to a final thickness of 0. 5 mm. Subsequently the strips were subjected to simulated continuous annealing, using a salt bath furnace. The macro texture of both types of specimens was measured and correlated to the mechanical properties, including the Lankford values. A very different development of the recrystallisation texture and hence mechanical properties has been observed. However, both grades yielded improved deep-drawing properties...|$|R

40|$|Part A. The {{first part}} of the work was focused on {{synthesis}} of the metal hydride using the electric discharge assisted mechanical milling (EDAMM). EDAMM is a new method used to synthesis metal hydride that was developed at university of Wollongong by A/Prof. Andrzej Calka. The reaction of metal and hydrogen to form metal hydride was observed. Different parameters were used to synthesis metal hydride. A variety of samples such as: Ti, Zr, W, Al, Mg, Fe, V, Nb were prepared and processed by the EDAMM method under hydrogen environment. After EDAMM processing, the phases present were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen (CHN) analysis was used to determine hydrogen content. Zirconium hydride (ZrH 1. 8) was formed from the reaction of zirconium and hydrogen using this technique containing 1. 24 wt%H. Vanadium formed new phase using this method with 0. 23 wt%H. This phase could be metal hydride but because of lack of database in the traces software, the new phase could not be determined. For Fe, Ti and Nb there was shifting of peaks in XRD patterns suggesting the formation of solid solution after milling in hydrogen atmosphere. These elements contained 0. 23 wt%, 0. 31 wt% and 0. 29 wt% of hydrogen respectively. The XRD patterns of W, Al and Mg XRDs showed no reaction, possibly due to the low decomposition temperature of Al and Mg metal hydride, and very high temperature decomposition for W above the spark milling temperature. This study was able to show that the EDAMM technique is suitable to synthesis metal hydrides that have high decomposition temperatures. Part B. The second phase of the work dealt with hydrogen permeation studies in X 70 pipeline steels using the electrochemical method developed by Devanathan and Stachurski. Samples from centreline and edge regions of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> of standard (1. 1 wt. % Mn) and medium Mn (0. 5 wt. % Mn) X 70 steel as well as normalized X 70 transfer bar were examined. The effect of increasing grain size on the diffusion of hydrogen in X 70 steel was also investigated. The diffusivity of hydrogen was correlated to the grain size, dislocations, microstructure and inclusions/precipitates present in the X 70 pipeline steel samples. The average grain size of the microstructure {{plays an important role in}} the diffusion process. The variation in diffusion coefficient with grain size showed a maximum value for a grain size of 46 μm. At grain sizes lower than this value, there was increased trapping at nodes and triple junctions whereas at higher grain sizes, there was a reduction in diffusion due a reduction in grain boundary surface area per unit volume. For the X 70 steel, the microstructure of the normalized transfer bar containing dislocation-free, coarse equiaxed ferrite grains was the least effective in trapping hydrogen and therefore exhibited the highest hydrogen diffusion coefficient. On the other hand, the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> standard Mn <b>strip</b> having finer elongated grains and a larger amount of strain in the material than the normalized transfer bar displayed the lowest diffusivity. The as received transfer bar samples which had bainitic microstructures showed intermediate values of diffusivity. The <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> medium Mn <b>strip</b> displayed the diffusion coefficients lower than that of the standard Mn strip, due to the contribution to trapping from a finer grain size as well as higher area fraction of carbo-nitride precipitates and inclusions compared to the X 70 strip. Moreover, the medium Mn strip exhibited a uniform microstructure and consequently similar diffusion coefficients for the edge and centerline regions. On the other hand, the finer grains of the edge region of the X 70 strip resulted in a lower diffusion coefficient...|$|R
