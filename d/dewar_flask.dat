50|$|As an {{alternative}} to the oven test the SADT for larger packages can be determined by substituting a <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> for the package. The heat transfer of the <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> can be matched to the heat transfer of a larger package size. This test is called the Heat Accumulation Storage Test (HAST).|$|E
50|$|These liquids may {{be stored}} in <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks,</b> which are double-walled {{containers}} with a high vacuum between the walls to reduce heat transfer into the liquid. Typical laboratory <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> are spherical, made of glass and protected in a metal outer container. <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> for extremely cold liquids such as liquid helium have another double-walled container filled with liquid nitrogen. <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> are named after their inventor, James Dewar, the man who first liquefied hydrogen. Thermos bottles are smaller vacuum flasks fitted in a protective casing.|$|R

40|$|<b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as containers for relatively long-term (25 days) storage of perishable scientific samples or other perishable objects at a temperature of 175 C. The refrigeration would be maintained through slow boiling of liquid nitrogen (LN 2). For {{the purposes of the}} application for which these containers were proposed, (1) the neck openings of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> are too small for most NASA samples; (2) the round shapes of the COTS containers give rise to unacceptably low efficiency of packing in rectangular cargo compartments; and (3) the COTS containers include metal structures that are too thermally conductive, such that they cannot, without exceeding size and weight limits, hold enough LN 2 for the required long-term-storage. In comparison with COTS <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks,</b> the proposed containers would be rectangular, yet would satisfy the long-term storage requirement without exceeding size and weight limits; would have larger neck openings; and would have greater sample volumes, leading to a packing efficiency of about double the sample volume as a fraction of total volume. The proposed containers would be made partly of aerospace- type composite materials and would include vacuum walls, multilayer insulation, and aerogel insulation...|$|R

50|$|As {{suggested}} for example by Carathéodory {{and used for}} example by Callen, the favoured instance of an adiabatic wall {{is that of a}} <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask.</b> A <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> has rigid walls. Nevertheless, Carathéodory requires that his adiabatic walls shall be imagined to be flexible, and that the pressures on these flexible walls be adjusted and controlled externally so that the walls are not deformed, unless a process is undertaken in which work is transferred across the walls. The work considered by Carathéodory is pressure-volume work. Another text considers asbestos and fiberglass as good examples of materials that constitute a practicable adiabatic wall.|$|E

50|$|Liquid {{oxygen in}} a {{cryogenic}} storage <b>dewar</b> (vacuum-insulated <b>flask)</b> {{is used in}} aerospace, submarine and gas industries.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, over 3 {{million pounds}} of liquid oxygen were {{used for this purpose}} in Germany alone, and {{additional}} 201,466 lb (91,383 kg) were consumed by British quarries. The accident rate was lower than with conventional explosives. However, the <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> the LOX was stored in occasionally exploded, which was caused by iron impurities in the activated carbon serving as trace gas absorbent in the insulation vacuum layer in the flask, which caused spontaneous ignition in case of LOX leak into the enclosed space.|$|R
50|$|Eye {{protection}} is required {{at all times}} when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.|$|E

40|$|Layers in {{multilayer}} insulation {{charged to}} keep them separated by electrostatic repulsion, eliminating need for spacer nets. Removal of spacer nets reduces conduction of heat between layers. Insulation in question type used to slow leakage of heat into <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> containing liquid helium. Proposal originally applied to insulation in cryogenic cooling subsystems of infrared-detector systems in outer space, also appears applicable to small panels of insulation for terrestrial cryogenic equipment, provided layers contained in evacuated spaces and weight of each layer small fraction of electrostatic force upon it...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe Municipal Solid Waste Organic Fraction (MSWOF) and sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants have, among the agricultural waste with interest, the greatest concern because of their potential on organic and inorganic contaminants and also due the large quantities produced. However, products obtained after their treatment can have agricultural interest since they fulfill the quality standards. Two nitrogen sources (sodium caseinate and soy beans) and a carbon source (starch, cellulose or sucrose) were added to composts from different sources. Mixtures were maintained in <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> during 10 days. Stability was evaluated using the following parameters: maximum temperature reached, respiratory activity (AT 4) and Solvita®. The fastest increase of temperature was observed for composts with starch addition, which indicates higher microbial activity, so the application of stabilized composts to soils during the incorporation of biodegradable materials (with starch) can promote their biodegradability. Dewar test was more sensitive for the stability assessment. Results of Solvita® test at 24 hours were similar to Dewar test results. AT 4 test gave different stability levels for composts with addition of carbon sources, but similar for the initial composts...|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> is {{the base}} for a device used to passively insulate medical shipments.

50|$|In the {{sorption}} phase {{the pump}} is actually {{used to create}} a vacuum. This is achieved by cooling the pump body to low temperatures, typically by immersing it in a <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> filled with liquid nitrogen.

5000|$|A [...] {{refrigerated}} transport Dewar is a {{refrigerated transport}} vessel with an insulated <b>Dewar</b> <b>flask</b> (vacuum) design to carry cryogenic liquid.

The liquid can be withdrawn as a gas by passing liquid through an internal vaporizer or as a liquid under its own vapour pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Tanks {{get very}} hot when filled rapidly. SCUBA tanks are {{sometimes}} immersed in water to cool them down {{when they are}} being filled. That {{would not be possible}} with tanks in a car and thus it would either {{take a long time to}} fill the tanks, or they would have to take less than a full charge, since heat drives up the pressure. However, if well insulated, such as <b>Dewar</b> (vacuum) <b>flask</b> design, the heat would not have to be lost but put to use when the car was running.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum flasks {{are at risk}} of {{implosion}} hazard, {{and glass}} vessels under vacuum, in particular, may shatter unexpectedly. Chips, scratches or cracks can be a starting point for dangerous vessel failure, especially when the vessel temperature changes rapidly (when hot or cold liquid is added). Proper preparation of the <b>Dewar</b> vacuum <b>flask</b> by tempering prior to use is advised to maintain and optimize the functioning of the unit. Glass vacuum flasks are usually fitted into a metal base with the cylinder contained in or coated with mesh, aluminum or plastic to aid in handling, protect it from physical damage, and contain fragments should they break.|$|R
25|$|James Dewar, the {{scientist}} after whom the <b>Dewar</b> (vacuum <b>flask)</b> is named, {{spent much time}} studying activated carbon and published a paper regarding its adsorption capacity with regard to gases. In this paper, he discovered that cooling the carbon to liquid nitrogen temperatures allowed it to adsorb significant quantities of numerous air gases, among others, that could then be recollected by simply allowing the carbon to warm again and that coconut based carbon was superior for the effect. He uses oxygen as an example, wherein the activated carbon would typically adsorb the atmospheric concentration (21%) under standard conditions, but release over 80% oxygen if the carbon was first cooled to low temperatures.|$|R

30|$|The reactor {{was filled}} with a known {{quantity}} of one reactant and the system was allowed to reach a steady-state temperature. A known amount of the second reactant was then added. The resulting mixture was then allowed to reach a steady-state temperature before the magnetic stirrer was switched on. The resulting voltage–time data were continuously recorded and converted to temperature–time data and graphs as described in the previous section. The esterification reaction studied was carried out in an ordinary <b>Dewar</b> thermos <b>flask</b> acting as an adiabatic batch reactor of total volume 500  cm 3 (0.5  dm 3) with a magnetic stirrer. Acetic acid/ethanol was the starting material. In all experiments, the mole ratio of acetic acid/ethanol was 1 : 1, respectively.

40|$|A rapid {{development}} of the wood–based panel industry {{has been reported in}} recent literature. Major growth opportunities are expected to continue in particleboard market. The supply for wood which is so far the main raw material for particleboard has become problematic. Particleboard industry is intensifying efforts to find suitable substitutes for wood. In recent years effective utilization of thinning produce, wood and agricultural residues has gained increasing importance. Several attempts were made to mix different types of raw materials for making particleboard. Particleboard production is directly linked to some of the key issues of our times, namely; resources conservation, housing and the environment. This study investigated the effect of some conventional treatments on compatibility of cement and some wood and non-wood lignocellulosic materials. It also examined the effect of blending different proportions of the lignocellulosic materials on the properties of particleboards made using cement (inorganic binder) and Urea formaldehyde (organic binder). The three lignocellulosic materials used were Acacia nilotica sawdust, bagasse and cotton stalks. They are waste materials of widely cultivated species in Sudan. They were collected from EL Suki sawmill, EL Gunied sugar factory and the Fields of EL Kamlin state. Four experiments were carried out. The first was conducted to investigate the effect of six treatments {control (untreated material), control + 3 %CaCl 2, hot water extraction, Hot water extraction + 3 %CaCl 2, 1 %NaOH extraction, and 1 %NaOH extraction + 3 %CaCl 2 } on the hydration characteristics of the three lignocellulosic materials with cement. Two <b>Dewar</b> <b>flasks</b> and a digital thermocouple were used. The maximum hydration temperature, time to reach maximum temperature and rise in temperature above the ambient were determined for each lignocellulosic material. The most suitable treatment common to all materials was the 1 %NaOH+ 3 %CaCl 2. The average maximum hydration temperatures were 63. 87 °C, for bagasse, 67. 87 °C for cotton stalks and 67. 9 °C for sunt sawdust. Bagasse was the least responsive material to the treatments used, followed by cotton stalks and then sunt sawdust. In the second experiment, extractive contents, lignin content, hot water and weak alkali solubility of the three lignocellulosic materials were determined. The results of the above mentioned tests revaled that bagasse attained the highest results of hot water and 1 % NaOH extraction. The results were therefore consistent with the hydration characteristics observed. In the third experiment different mixtures and ratios were used to manufacture laboratory size cement bonded particle boards. Analysis of variance and Duncan Multiple Range Test were used to study the significance of the variations, if any. Reasonable panel properties were obtained from the three lignocellulosic materials either pure or mixed using different cement/wood ratios (3 : 1, 3. 5 : 1 and 4 : 1). In the fourth experiment ten different mixtures of the three lignocellulosic materials (Nine homogenous, One layered) of urea formaldehyde resin bonded particleboards were manufactured under the laboratory conditions. The minimum property requirements of commercial particleboard standards EN 312 : 2003 for MOR,MOE were met or exceeded at 10 % resin content level except for pure cotton stalks boards. Addition of bagasse particles to sunt sawdust or cotton stalks or to their mixtures improved the properties of boards made of their respective blend...|$|R
