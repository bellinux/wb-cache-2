25|$|A {{regional}} {{road network}} expanded {{from the city}} through the 1950s. The latter part of that decade also saw CNR begin development of a major railway <b>hump</b> <b>yard</b> in the city's west end. Further changes saw the downtown railyard modified and the historic passenger station demolished in favour of a small modern structure. This was followed by development of the Highfield Square shopping centre and several office buildings (CN Terminal Plaza) in the early 1960s.|$|E

500|$|By 1968 with {{hopes of}} {{bringing}} a new influx of coal mining into the city, Sahara Coal Company ordered the Bucyrus-Erie [...] "GEM of Egypt" [...] strip mine shovel, {{one of the}} largest in the world at 8-stories high and weighing 1,000 tons. It took three men to operate it, and its bucket capacity was 30 cubic yards. Even with such great efforts coal mining continued to dwindle within the community. The train depot was razed in 1972 and all coal freight was ordered out of the Harrisburg <b>Hump</b> <b>Yard</b> by 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, many of the city-square storefronts and mini-plazas became vacant and were slowly abandoned as large Chain stores [...] and Strip malls on Commercial Street became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment, hoping to bring an influx of travelers from the main highway.|$|E
500|$|First slope mine {{operations}} began in 1854 southeast of Harrisburg. During the early years, the coal was transported by wagon to local {{homes and businesses}} for heating. Coal Mining became an important industry for the post-Antebellum, now Gilded Age city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 and provided transportation for coal and the miners who tired away underground. After a series of corporate transactions brought the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad {{into the hands of}} the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway around 1890, with Illinois state representative Charles P Skaggs as mayor, Harrisburg evolved into one of the leading coal-mining centers of the Midwest. Harrisburg was a strategic spot on the railroad route with a large <b>hump</b> <b>yard,</b> making it the focal point for the most productive coal field operations. Some of the most profitable coal companies that operated around Harrisburg were Big Creek Coal, Harrisburg Coal and O'Gara Coal. Each one with their own sizable rail yards. O'gara was a Progressive Era coal company owned by Thomas J. O'gara of Chicago. He purchased and annexed 23 privately owned mines in the Harrisburg coal field which equaled [...] of land. The Company based its headquarters in Harrisburg in 1905. O'gara only owned 12 operating mines, all in Saline County, but they had an annual output of 7,000,000 tons. 6,000 men were employed in a field capacity and the pay roll disbursement was $150,000 per month. The company paid $10,000 monthly royalty. H. Thomas was the company's general manager of mines, Ed Ghent its chief engineer and D. B. McGehee the assistant general manager.|$|E

Most hump yards are single yards with one classification bowl, but some, mostly very large, hump yards have two of them, one for each direction, thus are double yards, such as the Maschen, Antwerp, Clearing, and Bailey yards.

2500|$|Part of the railroad's new {{strategy}} in the 1970s and 1980s was to seek new routes to expand and compete in the long haul railroad market. After Conrail took over the railroad operations of Penn Central in 1976 the Penn Central Corporation sought to divest itself of its subsidiary the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad (DT). [...] After petitioning the Interstate Commerce Commission GTW won approval over a joint bid from Norfolk and Western and Chessie System to acquire the DT in June 1980. The acquisition increased GTW's trackage around Detroit's industries including Ford Motor Company's large River Rouge Complex, DT's classification <b>hump</b> <b>yard</b> in Flat Rock, Michigan and routes south into Ohio with access to rail interchanges in Cincinnati, Ohio. As part of the ICC's approval GTW was obligated to divest its half or buy Norfolk and Western's share in the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line. It purchased N's share in April 1981 for $1.9 million and completely merged the line into GTW later that same year.|$|E

25|$|Gravity yards are {{operated}} {{similarly to}} <b>hump</b> <b>yards</b> but, {{in contrast to}} the latter, the whole yard is set up on a continuous falling gradient. When they were invented in the 19th century, saving shunting engines and instead letting the cars roll by gravity was seen as a major benefit, whereas the larger amount of manual work required to stop the rolling cars in the classification tracks was judged to be not that important. Gravity yards were a historical step in the development of classification yards and were later judged as inferior to <b>hump</b> <b>yards,</b> because it became clear that shunting engines were needed anyway (at least in inclement weather like strong winds or icy temperatures when the oil in the bearings became thick), and because manual labour was getting relatively more and more expensive. Thus, only few gravity yards were ever built, sometimes requiring massive earthwork (one example is the first German gravity yard at Dresden).|$|R
