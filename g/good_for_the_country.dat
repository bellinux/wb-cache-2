He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

500|$|Brezhnev has {{fared well}} in Russian opinion polls when {{compared}} to his successors and predecessors. However, in the West he is most commonly remembered for starting the economic stagnation which triggered {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union. A 2000 poll by VTsIOM asked various Russians the question [...] "Was a given period more positive or more negative for the country?". 36 percent of the people polled viewed Brezhnev's tenure as more positive than negative. His predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev trailed close behind him, earning 33 percent. A poll by the Public Opinion Fund (VTsIOM) in September 1999 similarly chose the Brezhnev period as the time in the 20th century when [...] "ordinary people lived best", having a clear majority of 51 to 10. In a similar poll done in 1994, Brezhnev garnered a majority of only 36 to 16. According to a 2006 Public Opinion Fund poll, 61 percent of the Russian people viewed the Brezhnev era as <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A poll by the VTsIOM in 2007 showed that the majority of Russians would choose to live during the Brezhnev era over any other period of 20th-century Russian history. Researchers have noted a surge in Brezhnev's popularity, along with other communist rulers, during and {{in the aftermath of the}} Russian financial crisis of 1998, which is well remembered by many Russians for plunging many into poverty. When comparing these two periods, Brezhnev's USSR is best remembered for stability in prices and income by the Russians and not the socio-economic stagnation for which he is remembered in the West.|$|E

Wilson, {{nominated for a}} cabinet post, told Congress [...] "...what was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> was good for General Motors and vice versa," [...] he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires—the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying [...] "What's good for General Bullmoose is good for everybody!" [...] Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of [...] "haves" [...] versus [...] "have-nots". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the Left, and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former Franklin D. Roosevelt liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.|$|E

In an October 26, 2007 {{appearance at}} Cornell University, Colbert declared that, if elected, {{he would be}} [...] "as <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> as Doritos are for your body." [...] Colbert's campaign was initially called the [...] "Hail To The Cheese Stephen Colbert's Nacho Cheese Doritos 2008 Presidential Campaign," [...] until he was advised that the finances obtained from Doritos could legally be used to fund only his television show's coverage of the campaign, rather than the campaign itself. Colbert responded by adding the word [...] "Coverage" [...] to the title. Some commentators argued that such distinctions could have had serious legal ramifications for Colbert irrespective of how serious his campaign effort was. In order to avoid breaking election laws and maintain the distinction between coverage and activism, Colbert had to move a petition for South Carolina Democrats to sign from his show's website to an independent website that is not affiliated with his show. A spokesperson for Comedy Central, the network hosting The Colbert Report, stated that, based on [...] "the law, prior rulings made by the Federal Election Commission and advice of expert outside counsel", {{there was nothing in}} the run that ran contrary to federal campaign election laws.|$|E
2500|$|The party {{coalesced}} around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive {{correspondence with}} like-minded Republican leaders throughout the country. Washington frequently decried the {{growing sense of}} [...] "party" [...] emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of the day. The Republicans wanted to maintain the 1778 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic. Even though Britain was by far United States' leading trading partner, Republicans feared that increased trade would undermine republicanism. The Republicans distrusted Hamilton's national bank and rejected his premise that a national debt was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> as Republicans said they were both forms of corruption. They strongly distrusted the elitism of Hamilton's circle, denouncing it as [...] "aristocratic"; and they called for states' rights lest the Federalists centralize ever more power in the national governments. The intense debate over the Jay Treaty in 1794–1795 transformed those opposed to Hamilton's policies from a loose movement into a true political party. To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians [...] "established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns". However, they were defeated when Washington mobilized public opinion {{in favor of the}} treaty.|$|E

But first Fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong. In spite {{of the quality of}} the magazine, and in spite of the kindness which so many newspaper men felt for Fulkerson, the notices in the New York papers seemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor. A merit in the work was acknowledged, and certain defects in it for which March had trembled were ignored; but the critics astonished him by selecting for censure points which he was either proud of or had never noticed; which being now brought to his notice he still could not feel were faults. He owned to Fulkerson that if they had said so and so against it, he could have agreed with them, but that to say thus and so was preposterous; and that if the advertising had not been adjusted with such generous recognition of the claims of the different papers, he should have known the counting-room was at the bottom of it. As it was, he could only attribute it to perversity or stupidity. It was certainly stupid to condemn a magazine novelty like 'Every Other Week' for being novel; and to augur that if it failed, it would fail through its departure from the lines on which all the other prosperous magazines had been built, was in the last degree perverse, and it looked malicious.
