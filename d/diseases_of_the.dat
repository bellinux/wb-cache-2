5|$|Cardiovascular diseases, {{which include}} <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, {{are the leading}} cause of death worldwide. The {{majority}} of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists.

40|$|To assess <b>the</b> {{validity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present subdivision <b>of</b> {{patients with}} {{inflammatory bowel disease}} into those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small bowel or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colon and those with ulcerative colitis, 252 patients with inflammatory bowel disease have been studied by questionnaire and case note review. One hundred and seventy-two variables concerning the nature and frequency of symptoms in remission and relapse, <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> complications and results of investiga-tion have been analysed by computer. As expected, there were many highly significant variables between patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small bowel. The latter showed evidence of a more severe disease course with more complications. There were similar, although less marked, differences between patients with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colon and those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small bowel. There were very few differences in disease course between patients with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colon and those with ulcerative colitis. The results suggest that while separate classification of patients with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small bowel is justified on clinical grounds, <b>the</b> present separation <b>of</b> patients with <b>disease</b> confined to the colon into groups labelled ulcerative colitis or Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colon is not.

5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for <b>Diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his study}} in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads {{was chosen to}} lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in {{clinical}} hematology, to study <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood-forming organs.

In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue (and relieve anemia). Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field.|$|E

Rhesus c hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newborn can range from a mild to severe disease - is the third most common form of severe HDN. Rhesus e and rhesus C hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newborn are rare. Combinations of antibodies, for example, anti-Rhc and anti-RhE occurring together can be especially severe.|$|R
5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, coumarin and glycosides.

5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924).

His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text <b>Diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology.

5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain).|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book <b>Diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast {{is a rare}} {{manifestation of}} breast carcinoma. CASE REPORT: The patient {{presented}} with a red lesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left nipple-areola complex. Breast physical examination, ultrasonography and mammography were normal bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correctly depicted Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nipple. Before surgery the patient underwent biopsy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesion that showed Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast associated with an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ. The patient underwent left mastectomy and unilateral axillary lymph node dissection. The patient refused the breast-conserving surgery because she was afraid {{that she could have}} a recurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carcinoma. Microscopy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesion confirmed the MRI diagnosis. CONCLUSION: MRI was very useful and accurate to diagnose Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast without palpable mass, ultrasonographic and mammographic findings...|$|R
