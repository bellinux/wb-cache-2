5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a <b>distribution</b> <b>fee</b> of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the {{distributors}} at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest <b>distribution</b> <b>fee</b> received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E
5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, {{to ensure that this}} one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a <b>distribution</b> <b>fee.</b> The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its <b>distribution</b> <b>fee,</b> the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E
40|$|Mutual fund {{companies}} typically charge investors <b>distribution</b> <b>fees,</b> such as 12 b- 1 fees in the United States, which they then use to pay commissions to brokers. We evaluate a major Indian investor protection reform that limited {{the ability of}} mutual funds to charge <b>distribution</b> <b>fees</b> to pay broker commissions. We identify {{the impact of this}} policy change by comparing funds charging high <b>distribution</b> <b>fees</b> prior to the reform to those charging low distribution fees; we show that trends in asset growth across these groups prior to the reform were similar, and argue that a comparison of their asset growth after the reform is indicative of the policy impact. Contrary to claims by industry that banning <b>distribution</b> <b>fees</b> would dramatically reduce investment in mutual funds, we find no evidence that the post-reform asset growth was lower for funds charging higher <b>distribution</b> <b>fees</b> prior to the reform. We primarily find that asset growth in funds with previously high <b>distribution</b> <b>fees</b> was higher after the policy change. At the aggregate level, our results suggest that Indian mutual fund growth in the post-policy period was lower for reasons independent of this policy change, such as a general move away from mutual funds towards real assets such as gold and real estate following the 2008 financia...|$|R

5|$|The two {{companies}} attempted {{to reach a}} new agreement for ten months before it fell through in January 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films {{on their own and}} collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the <b>distribution</b> <b>fee.</b> More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006). Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.|$|E
5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent <b>distribution</b> <b>fee.</b> The lack of story and sequel rights {{was perhaps the most}} onerous aspect to Pixar and {{set the stage for a}} contentious relationship.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} terms imposed by Universal Studios, which had {{distributed}} their previous two films, the studio found an alternative distributor in United Artists. Somewhat unusually, production investors Goldcrest Films covered {{the cost of}} the release prints and the promotional campaign, in return for a greatly reduced <b>distribution</b> <b>fee</b> from UA. This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth's first feature film, The Secret of NIMH. Goldcrest Films invested $15 million in printing and promoting the film. Due to contractual issues, very little tie-in merchandise accompanied the film's theatrical release; a computer game adaptation for the Commodore Amiga's DOS system (with a free software package) was released, and restaurant chain Wendy's offered toys with their Kids' Meals or regular fries.|$|E

In late 2012, The Walt Disney Company announced a deal to acquire Lucasfilm for $4.05billion, with approximately half in cash and half in shares of Disney stock. Although Disney gained the ownership rights to all six Star Wars films, under a previous deal with Lucasfilm, the full distribution rights to A New Hope will remain with Fox in perpetuity, while the physical distribution arrangements for the remaining films are set to expire in 2020 (Lucasfilm had retained the television and digital distribution rights to all Star Wars films produced after the original).|$|E

40|$|In 1998 Bergendahl & Son AB, as {{the sole}} owner {{alongside}} with BTL as a partner, created Matomera. Matomera was unique in Sweden in its concept of selling groceries only on the Internet with no supporting physical store. Instead they used a dedicated warehouse especially designed for this purpose. In B 2 C e-commerce the buying decisions and the face-to-face communication between consumers and companies are separated in time or excluded. Therefore the possibility to interact with and to influence consumers is often restrained to the website and call-centres. Along with this there is an added responsibility of picking and delivering the goods to consumers. When selling groceries on the Internet {{there is a lack}} of knowledge concerning consumer response to websites and consumer requirements on home deliveries. Therefore logistics concerning home deliveries is an important part in fulfilling consumer demands as the responsibility of picking and delivering has been transferred from the consumer to the grocer.

The most important aspect of this impact was decline of investment funds' net asset value (from 139, 0 billion PLN to 77, 2 billion PLN). It was due to decreasing value of securities in funds' investment portfolios and negative balance of payments and amortizations (investors withdrew from funds 25, 4 billion PLN more than they paid in).
