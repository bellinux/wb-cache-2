On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture--a white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows were curtains of snowy white <b>jaconet</b> muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a [...] "carnival piece," [...] spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my attention.|$|E

They fell first of all on Clem, looking insupportably prosperous, and patronising Torrance with the favour of a modified attention, as of one who was used to better things in Glasgow. Though he had never before set eyes on him, Archie had no difficulty in identifying him, and no hesitation in pronouncing him vulgar, the worst of the family. Clem was leaning lazily forward when Archie first saw him. Presently he leaned nonchalantly back; and that deadly instrument, the maiden, was suddenly unmasked in profile. Though not quite {{in the front of the}} fashion (had anybody cared!), certain artful Glasgow mantua-makers, and her own inherent taste, had arrayed her to great advantage. Her accoutrement was, indeed, a cause of heart-burning, and almost of scandal, in that infinitesimal kirk company. Mrs. Hob had said her say at Cauldstaneslap. [...] "Daftlike!" [...] she had pronounced it. [...] "A jaiket that'll no meet! Whaur's the sense of a jaiket that'll no button upon you, if it should come to be weet? What do ye ca' thir things? Demmy brokens, d'ye say? They'll be brokens wi' a vengeance or ye can win back! Weel, I have naething to do wi' it--it's no good taste." [...] Clem, whose purse had thus metamorphosed his sister, and who was not insensible to the advertisement, had come to the rescue with a [...] "Hoot, woman! What do you ken of good taste that has never been to the ceety?" [...] And Hob, looking on the girl with pleased smiles, as she timidly displayed her finery in the midst of the dark kitchen, had thus ended the dispute: [...] "The cutty looks weel," [...] he had said, [...] "and it's no very like rain. Wear them the day, hizzie; but it's no a thing to make a practice o'." [...] In the breasts of her rivals, coming to the kirk very conscious of white under-linen, and their faces splendid with much soap, the sight of the toilet had raised a storm of varying emotion, from the mere unenvious admiration that was expressed in a long-drawn [...] "Eh!" [...] to the angrier feeling that found vent in an emphatic [...] "Set her up!" [...] Her frock was of straw-coloured <b>jaconet</b> muslin, cut low at the bosom and short at the ankle, so as to display her demi-broquins of Regency violet, crossing with many straps upon a yellow cobweb stocking. According to the pretty fashion in which our grandmothers did not hesitate to appear, and our great-aunts went forth armed for the pursuit and capture of our great-uncles, the dress was drawn up so as to mould the contour of both breasts, and in the nook between, a cairngorm brooch maintained it. Here, too, surely in a very enviable position, trembled the nosegay of primroses. She wore on her shoulders--or rather, on her back and not her shoulders, which it scarcely passed--a French coat of sarsenet, tied in front with Margate braces, and of the same colour with her violet shoes. About her face clustered a disorder of dark ringlets, a little garland of yellow French roses surmounted her brow, and the whole was crowned by a village hat of chipped straw. Amongst all the rosy and all the weathered faces that surrounded her in church, she glowed like an open flower--girl and raiment, and the cairngorm that caught the daylight and returned it in a fiery flash, and the threads of bronze and gold that played in her hair.|$|E
