5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2013, about 90 {{students}} held a walkout {{and protest}} in objection {{to a recent}} trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen <b>experience,</b> <b>has</b> varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E

5|$|As {{reported}} by {{a writer of}} Jet in September 2007, the tour had been selling out in every city it appeared at. In October 2009, when Knowles was chosen for the Woman of the Year Award presented by Billboard magazine, the gross from her tours was revealed. Between April 21 and September 8, 2007 it was reported to the magazine that The Beyoncé Experience grossed $24.9 million and 272,521 fans attended the twenty nine shows which were submitted to the boxscore at that time. The highest-grossing concert of the tour was at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York with $2,744,345.

5|$|Sam Loover, {{a family}} friend and an agent of World Intelligence Network (WIN), persuades Mac to {{dedicate}} the services of Joe and the BIG RAT to the organisation: Joe will become a WIN operative with a difference, the unlimited possibilities offered by the BIG RAT serving as an invaluable tool for completing missions. After requisite knowledge and <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> been transferred, and provided that Joe is wearing customised glasses containing hidden electrodes (a portable storage device for brain impulses), {{he is able to}} carry out missions requiring proficiency in – among other disciplines – flying fighter aircraft, spaceflight, performing advanced neurosurgery and piano.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E

25|$|Chainsaw gloves have cut-proof fabric {{protection}} {{like that}} for trousers, but only {{on the back of}} the left hand.

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} mystical <b>experience</b> <b>has</b> shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist {{approach to a}} contextual and empirical approach.

The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, {{takes into account the}} historical and cultural context. Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E
