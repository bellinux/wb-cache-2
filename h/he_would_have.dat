5|$|According to some narrations, on Umar’s death bed, {{he named}} people who <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{appointed}} as successors to the Caliphate {{if they had}} been alive, and amongst those he named was Khalid.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been with Claudius {{and his family}} {{for the majority of}} the time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's first {{project was}} a {{libretto}} for a comic opera called Le Corsaire, based on Lord Byron's The Corsair. Realizing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> trouble finding a composer, however, {{he turned to}} other pursuits.|$|E

60|$|If Baroski had not {{fallen in}} love with Morgiana, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> given her two hundred guineas' worth of lessons; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> so far presumed as to seize her hand, and attempt to kiss it; if he had not {{attempted}} to kiss her, she <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> boxed his ears; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> taken out the writ against Walker; Walker <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been free, very possibly rich, and therefore certainly respected: he always said that a month's more liberty <b>would</b> <b>have</b> set him beyond the reach of misfortune.|$|R
50|$|King <b>had</b> {{stated that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{been willing to}} attend the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, due to threats against the Games. He further stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> wanted his family to attend either.|$|R
5|$|By Edwin's debt of {{allegiance}} to him, Rædwald {{became the first}} foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been instrumental in Edwin's secure establishment as king of both Deira and Bernicia.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{compared}} Kilmer to British Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton—suggesting {{that his}} reputation might {{have risen to}} the level where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been considered their American counterpart if not for his untimely death.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E
50|$|A more Jamesian example: a swain, {{convinced}} that the fair maiden must love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>had</b> his initial prophecy been defeatist.|$|R

5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E

5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{familiar}} with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.|$|E
6000|$|It was at {{this point}} that the dim {{beginnings}} of philosophy began to invade her mind. The thing resolved itself almost into an equation. If father had not <b>had</b> indigestion <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> bullied her. But, if father had not made a fortune <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> had indigestion. Therefore, if father had not made a fortune <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> bullied her. Practically, in fact, if father did not bully her <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be rich.

5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing {{on the wrong}} side of the road, leading to a head-on collision.

5|$|Breyer was the second-longest-serving junior {{justice in}} the history of the Court, close to surpassing the record set by Justice Joseph Story of 4,228 days (from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823); Breyer fell 29 days short of tying this record, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reached on March 1, 2006, had Justice Samuel Alito not joined the Court on January 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because he thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople {{in the summer of}} 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
50|$|Kuyt is {{the third}} of four children. His father was a {{fisherman}} and he has stated that if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> found a career in football <b>he</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> followed his father into the family business. He {{grew up in the}} fishing town of Katwijk aan Zee.|$|R
60|$|The sailor now {{told him}} {{the names of the}} masts and stays, giving him a general idea of the work aloft, and {{presently}} asked him whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to return to the deck now, or to mount a bit higher. Although Reuben was now becoming accustomed to the position, <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> consulted his inner feelings, have rather gone down than up; but he thought it was better to put a good face on it, and to accustom himself, at once, to what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> to do sooner or later.|$|R

5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights. However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said publicly that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been opposed to gay marriage.|$|E
5|$|Franco's plane {{landed in}} Gran Canaria on July 14, but, based in Tenerife, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been unable to}} make the plane without the death of General Amado Balmes, {{military}} commander in Gran Canaria, {{who was killed in}} a shooting accident on July 16. Whether his death was an accident, suicide, or murder is unknown.|$|E
60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr never heeded {{him or his}} stare; nor, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done so, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> known who it {{was that}} looked at him from behind the make-up of Scaramouche; nor, again, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> known, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been in the least troubled or concerned.|$|R

5|$|He {{also told}} reporters that {{he was certain that}} Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm.

5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor does he have a {{speaking}} role. It is logical, however, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding that the group if there to celebrate.|$|E
