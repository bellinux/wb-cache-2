5000|$|Goldman's {{critical}} 1981 biography Elvis {{was much}} more controversial. In this book, Goldman drew on more than four years' research into Elvis Presley's life. But for many fans and some critics, his research was undermined by his intense personal dislike of Presley. For instance, Goldman dismissed Presley as a plagiarist who never did anything of note after his first records at Sun Records, insisting that he was inferior as an artist to Little Richard and other early rock'n'roll singers. He also portrayed Presley as nearly insane, using stories that some might see as innocuous (such as Presley taking his friends <b>halfway</b> across the <b>country</b> to buy them peanut-butter sandwiches) to [...] "prove" [...] that the singer had lost his grip on reality.|$|R

The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic Test Stand building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration Test tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together.

It’s a condition you’ve never heard of, {{does not appear in}} popular press or literature. You are forced to rely on your pediatric neurologist, who does not have the best communication skills, for an explanation of your child’s condition. Given that this syndrome’s outcomes tend to be unfavorable, this physician does not want to provide you with too much information for fear it will be too much for you to handle. At this point in time, widespread use of the World Wide Web is still a decade away and you have no access to a medical school library. The condition is so rare there are no support groups or organizations available to you, with the result being that you feel more alone and isolated than ever.

40|$|Is a brand a product, a service, or a company? Is it a logo, a {{marketing}} strategy or an attitude? As globalization intensifies, places increasingly {{compete with other}} places for attention, influence, markets, investments, businesses, visitors, residents, talent and events. And competition is no longer restricted to the well-known places down the road, over the hill or across the water. Places now compete with cities, regions and <b>countries</b> <b>halfway</b> around the world. Places are increasingly getting caught off guard by unpredicted and apparently rapid shifts in competition and abruptly lose their historic purpose or their competitive edge, be it economic, social or cultural. Culture fills our cities, regions, nations and even our rural landscapes with spiritual content. Our places are an expression {{of who we are}} and what we value and they are ruthless in projecting the bad alongside the good. In its widest sense culture includes art, design, education, science, religion and sport. In the context of place branding it is the manifestation of our beliefs, values, customs and behaviors. Merging culture to brand within our city tissue {{is an essential part of}} the morphology within its spaces.

40|$|Excerpt] “Walking down Nanjing Road in Shanghai, {{you will}} not only pass by the foreign {{clothing}} stores {{that seem to be}} taking over the area, but also Pepsi signs every fifty feet, a McDonald’s, and a KFC—all with the backdrop of Chinese characters and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. Along your way, you can stop in The Chopstick Shop to find the perfect set of chopsticks, buy a smoothie from a vendor, or just sit on a bench and watch the thousands of Chinese people walk by wearing Nike hats and Levi’s jeans. Just across the river is the Pudong New Area, ten years ago just farmland—now one of the most recognized skylines in China, indeed, in the world. These skyscrapers showcase foreign investment in China like nothing else. Foreign banks, companies, and law firms are all flocking to this area to compete in the Chinese marketplace. There is no doubt that even China, a <b>country</b> <b>halfway</b> across the world and so fundamentally different from the United States, is influenced by our business and culture. American culture is no longer limited to the fifty states, but {{is a way of life}} throughout most of the world. The way we dress, the way we act, even the way we think is becoming the global norm. However, this is not just a one-way road; the United States is also slowly adapting to the way the rest of the world thinks. One area where this can be seen is in the recent Supreme Court cases relying on international precedent. Much like the streets in China that are no longer free from foreign influences, our own Constitution is now being interpreted using international authority. Justices Scalia and Thomas disapprove. In his dissent in Lawrence v. Texas, Scalia went so far as to state that the use of international authority is meaningless and dangerous dicta. Justice Thomas, referencing international precedent on capital punishment, has stated that “this Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence should not impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions on Americans. ” But do we not as Americans impose our fashions, fads, and moods on the rest of the world? The irony is thick—our globalization mentality is coming back to haunt us. ...|$|R
50|$|Kentucky Governor William J. Fields {{objected to}} the Joint Board's plan, which took most major east-west routes (multiples of ten) to the East Coast, but sent Route 60 from Los Angeles {{northeast}} to end in Chicago, leaving none to cross Kentucky, the only Mississippi Valley state without such a route. Proposals were considered for splitting US 60 into 60N and 60E at Springfield (MO) or using 62 for the Chicago route; Missouri had already prepared maps that showed the original plans for 60 and 62. The final plan, agreed to by the affected states, assigned US 66 to the Los Angeles-Chicago highway and US 60 to the route from Springfield to Virginia Beach (extended from Newport News), absorbing all of 62 and part of 52 from the 1925 plan.Although US 60 initially stretched less than <b>halfway</b> across the <b>country,</b> due to its late creation, it was soon extended west to Los Angeles. One auto trail — the Atlantic and Pacific Highway - and three other U.S. Highways {{played a part in}} this extension. The Atlantic and Pacific Highway had been organized in 1921, and connected New York City with Los Angeles. The original alignment of U.S. Route 70 entered Clovis, New Mexico from the east, as it does now, but continued west to Holbrook, Arizona. Crossing US 70 at Clovis was the El Paso-Amarillo U.S. Route 366. Finally, U.S. Route 164 was created by 1928, stretching northeast and east from Amarillo to U.S. Route 64 and U.S. Route 77 in Enid, Oklahoma. The American Association of State Highway Officials approved {{the first part of the}} extension in May 1930, following the rest of Missouri's Route 16 to the Oklahoma state line, and several state highways to Enid, before absorbing US 164 to a terminus at Amarillo. The remainder to Los Angeles was approved at AASHO's June 1931 meeting, and involved a number of other changes. US 60 replaced US 366 from Amarillo to Clovis, where it continued west along US 70 to Springerville, Arizona. The remainder of US 70 to Holbrook, Arizona became a new U.S. Route 260, while US 60 followed the Atlantic and Pacific Highway, which it had picked up at Vaughn, New Mexico, southwest and west through Phoenix to Los Angeles. US 70 was not truncated to Clovis, but was instead redirected southwest along US 366 to El Paso, and later reached Los Angeles itself, though most of the route west of Globe, Arizona overlapped US 60.|$|R
