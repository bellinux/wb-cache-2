40|$|Obesity {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of some types of injury in crashes. One hypothesis is that obesity adversely effects belt fit by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying skeletal structures. To evaluate this hypothesis, belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and women, 48 percent of whom were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of <b>upper</b> and lower <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations and ranges of seat height, seat cushion angle, and seat back angle spanning a large fraction of current vehicle front and rear seats. In some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical situation in the second row of a small sedan. Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 -kg/m 2 was associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap belt webbing length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants. Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across a wide range of <b>upper</b> <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations, and the shoulder belt webbing length between the D-ring and latchplate increased by an average of 60 mm with each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI. The results suggest that obesity effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} sled tests was {{conducted}} to examine the performance of booster seats under belt geometries representing the range found in the rear seats of current vehicles. Twelve tests were performed with the standard 6 YO Hybrid III ATD and 29 tests were performed with {{a modified version of}} the 6 YO ATD. The modified dummy has a pelvis with more realistic shape and flesh stiffness, a gel abdomen with biomechanically-based stiffness characteristics, and a custom neoprene jacket. Shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>upper</b> <b>anchorage</b> was set at the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> location and 64 mm inboard and outboard from this location. Lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations were chosen to span the range of lap belt angles permitted under FMVSS 210, using the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations and forward <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations that produce a much steeper lap belt angle. Four booster seats that provide a range of static belt fit were used. The ATDs were positioned using either the standard FMVSS No. 213 seating procedure or an alternate UMTRI procedure that produces postures closer to those of similar-size children. Kinematic results for the standard and modified dummies under the same test conditions were more similar than expected. The current version of the modified 6 YO is less sensitive to lap belt geometry than the prototype version of the dummy. The seating procedure had a greater affect on kinematic results. The UMTRI seating procedure produced greater knee-head excursion differences and less forward torso rotation than the FMVSS No. 213 procedure. Shifting the shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>upper</b> <b>anchorage</b> 128 mm laterally produced minimal variations in kinematics for a given booster seat/lap belt condition, likely because the belt-routing features of the booster seats limited the differences in static shoulder belt score to less than 10 mm. Moving the lap belt geometry from rearward (shallow angle) to forward (steep angle) produced less desirable kinematics with all booster seats tested. The forward position of the lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> allows greater forward translation of the booster and ATD before the belt engages the pelvis. Steeper belt angles are associated with better lap belt fit for children sitting without boosters, so designing rear seat belts for children who sit with and without boosters may involve a performance tradeoff...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATDâ€™s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder <b>belt</b> with fixed <b>anchorages.</b> Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorages</b> leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both <b>upper</b> and lower <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle <b>upper</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations on <b>belt</b> restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder belt fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. <b>Belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. <b>Belt</b> <b>upper</b> <b>anchorage</b> (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder belt routing clip. The shoulder belt was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|R
40|$|Seat <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> {{locations}} have {{a strong}} effect on occupant protection. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 210 specifies requirements for {{the layout of the}} anchorages relative to the seating reference point and seat back angle established by the SAE J 826 H-point manikin. Sled testing and computational simulation has established that <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations {{have a strong}} effect on occupant kinematics, particularly for child occupants using the belt as their primary restraint. As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, outboard seating positions of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|R

50|$|More than 98% of {{the local}} {{population}} depends on subsistence farming and some small scale of commercial agriculture by the sale of produce from cash crops. This agriculture is supplemented by petit trading, fishing, hunting and transport services dominated by bike riders most particularly {{during the dry season}} though practiced by a minute proportion of the population. The agro-pastoral activities practiced in the municipality follow the bioclimatic condition of the different areas. The lower belt and part of the middle belt practice the cultivation of cash crops such as palm oil, cocoa, Robusta coffee, gathering of non timber forest products, and food crops like plantains, cocoyams, cassavas bananas, pepper etc. The degree of palm oil cultivation I the lower belt is very high as compared to the middle belt which is just modest while the extremes of the middle <b>belt</b> and the <b>upper</b> <b>belt</b> practice the cultivation of market gardening products like Irish potatoes, cabbages, carrots, garlic and licks, cocoyams, sweet yams, ginger etc. The intensity of market gardening in the <b>Upper</b> <b>belt</b> is very high.
