40|$|Abstract Social bees can deposit {{specialized}} glandular secretions, or signals, {{that allow}} foragers to revisit rewarding {{and to avoid}} unrewarding <b>food</b> <b>sources.</b> However, {{it is not known}} if bees can orient towards olfactory cues such as excreta deposited near <b>food</b> <b>sources.</b> We report that Melipona mandacaia foragers (stingless bees) deposit an odor cue, anal droplets, and a previously undescribed ventro-abdominal odor on <b>food</b> <b>sources.</b> Surprisingly, foragers deposited attractive odor marks on good <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> to which they recruited and on poor <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> to which they did not recruit. Foragers left the most anal droplets on dilute <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> to which they did not recruit (1. 25 -M sucrose solution), yet returning foragers were attracted to anal droplets obtained on poor <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> and presented in bioassays. Foragers were attracted to ventro-abdominal odors ob-tained on good <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> (2. 5 -M sucrose solution). Chemical extractions suggest that odor marks contain attractive polar compounds. We also provide the first detailed description of forager waggling and spinning behavior on poor and good <b>food</b> <b>sources.</b> Waggling may be a method of dispersing anal droplets and spinning may help foragers learn local landmarks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} location-related {{accessibility to}} healthy and unhealthy <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> for school going children in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. We compared proximity to <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> from school sites and from small clusters of homes (i. e., dissemination blocks) {{as a proxy}} for home location. We found that (1) unhealthy <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> are more prevalent near schools in lower income than higher income neighbourhoods; (2) unhealthy compared to healthy <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> are more accessible from schools as well as from places of residence; and (3) while some characteristics of neighbourhood low socio-economic status are associated with less accessibility to healthy <b>food</b> <b>sources,</b> there is no consistent pattern of access. Greater access to unhealthy <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> from schools in low-income neighbourhoods is likely a reflection of the greater degree of commercialization. Our spatial examination provides a more nuanced understanding of accessibility through our approach of comparing place of residence and school access to <b>food</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: <b>food</b> <b>source</b> variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The <b>food</b> <b>source</b> variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the <b>food</b> <b>source</b> variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a <b>food</b> <b>source</b> in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a <b>food</b> <b>source.</b> Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E

Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable <b>food</b> <b>source</b> {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses its <b>food</b> <b>source</b> and dies as well.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the association of}} <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium with weight class in adolescent girls, the major <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium were determined for 718 sixth grade girls at three different time periods during an 18 month school-based health intervention program using a FFQ. To determine weight class, the BMI of each girl was stratified using CDC age and gender specific criteria at each time period. The percent contribution of the major <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium to total calcium intake was compared among the different weight classes at each time period, among those girls who had changed weight class at the different time periods and for those girls who did not change weight class at the different time periods. The mean total calcium intake increased by 20 % between the first two time periods and by 12 % {{between the first and}} last time periods with the intervention despite baseline total calcium intake already being greater than the recommended 1300 mg/day. The percent contribution of the major <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium were highly correlated among the weight classes that were compared throughout the study. Those girls who remained in the normal weight class throughout the study had the most consistent intake of <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium. Their top four <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium were different types of milk which provided greater than 50 % of their total calcium intake. Despite there being no significant differences in the major <b>food</b> <b>sources</b> of calcium among the different weight classes, these data show a successful intervention for increasing calcium intake among adolescent girls. ...|$|R
