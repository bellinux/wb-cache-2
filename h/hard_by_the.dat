5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Routes 40 and 99 (soon 99W) {{were marked}} along Route 6 in 1928. These two routes {{remained}} on West Capitol Avenue until 1954, {{when the new}} West Sacramento Freeway opened, connecting {{the west end of}} the Tower Bridge with the east end of the Yolo Causeway. Traveler-oriented businesses along the bypassed West Capitol Avenue were hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shifting of through traffic.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tanya was not {{considered}} a threat to land, as it did not move through the Azores while a tropical cyclone. The Azores were hit very <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105mph (170km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.|$|E

5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> storm. It {{is estimated that}} 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E

5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the French stud {{book was}} changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were {{closely related to the}} Percheron– {{including}} the horses of Berrichon, Nivernais, Marne, Augeron, Bourbonnais, Loire and Saône-et-Loire. French Percherons were also hit <b>hard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> advent of mechanization, and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market. The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding. Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism, export to Japan for draft work, and other markets. In 1993, a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the black stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant, smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron, while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were black, reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France. French breeders continue to import American-bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals, moving away from the heavier meat-type horses of the late 20th century. Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting docking, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996. This was partly {{at the request of the}} Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as Cheval.|$|E

Declining rates of unionization, lowered benefits, and fewer workplace compensations have had real effects in creating poor families.|$|R
