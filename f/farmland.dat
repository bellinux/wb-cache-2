5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open <b>farmland</b> were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final <b>farmland</b> {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E
5|$|All sub-{{watershed}}s of the Nescopeck Creek watershed contain {{at least}} 50 percent forest. A {{number of streams}} in the upper Nescopeck Creek watershed, in fact, have more than 80 percent forest coverage. Only 55 percent of the Black Creek watershed is covered by forest. Most sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek have {{only a small amount}} of barren land. However, the Cranberry Creek watershed contains 6.5 percent barren land, the Black Creek watershed contains 14 percent, and the Stony Creek watershed contains 30 percent. The Little Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 30 percent <b>farmland</b> and the Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 24 percent. Other sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek range from 2 to 13 percent <b>farmland.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Essex County Road11, Highway3 enters rural southwestern Ontario, and is {{dominated}} by <b>farmland</b> for much of its length through Essex County. The now four-laned route becomes divided as it follows the Essex Bypass around {{the southern edge of}} Essex, with commercial services lining the highway, primarily on the north side. Returning to <b>farmland</b> and narrowing to a two lane undivided road, the highway continues southeast, passing nearby, but avoiding, several small communities that the original highway travelled through.|$|E
50|$|This segment {{provides}} the opportunity to bike through the Deep South and travel through back-road <b>farmlands</b> and swamps and near Baptist churches. The route leaving Richmond heads south through the <b>farmlands</b> of Virginia and encounters swamps while crossing into North Carolina.|$|R
30|$|Shrinkage {{of forest}} cover and grasslands were observed, while <b>farmlands</b> and bare soil cover classes showed {{expansions}} from their original extent between 2004 and 2014 (Table  3). The expansion in bare soil cover was largely attributed to area gained from grasslands and <b>farmlands.</b> This {{could possibly be}} the impacts of poor farming practices and overgrazing of grasslands. Conversely, conversions of the original forest cover into <b>farmlands</b> and shrubs caused a decline in forest cover. Similarly, reduction in grassland covers was largely caused by the conversion of its initial extent into <b>farmlands.</b> The existence of these spatiotemporal transformations of the existing land cover classes has confirmed strong associations with soil loss rates in this period of analysis. The main reason for this increase in the soil erosion potential of the catchment over the studied period {{could be attributed to}} expansions of <b>farmlands</b> and bare soil cover at the expenses of forest area and grasslands. From these results, it can be inferred that any land use transitions into <b>farmlands</b> would be detrimental, as it was the major source of sediment while forest was the most effective barrier to soil loss.|$|R

40|$|Although condtion of {{gradient}} of <b>farmlands</b> is {{an important}} index to measure agricultural condition, this index is not adopted properly as the index of existing criteria to select target areas for financial supports to hilly and mountainious areas. Therefore, in this paper, we verified the criteria by condition of gradient of <b>farmlands.</b> From the results, it was clarified that these criteria didn't reflect condition of gradient of <b>farmlands</b> sufficiently. As the conclusion, to select criteria for measures to hilly and mountainous areas properly, indexes that show disadvantage agricultural and socio-economic conditions should be adopted...|$|R
50|$|Pefferlaw is {{primarily}} {{situated in a}} forest setting. <b>Farmlands</b> are to the west, the northwest and the north. More <b>farmlands</b> are east of Lake Ridge Road and Pefferlaw. The forests are almost connected with the forests south of Sutton. The forests cover most of the area around Pefferlaw and to the south with a few <b>farmlands</b> as well as within the shoreline of Lake Simcoe. The forests {{are mainly composed of}} pine and other varieties of trees and the size is about 600 to 700 square kilometres and about 80% of the area around Pefferlaw.|$|R
5|$|MD 404 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 662 (Old Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills {{on the border}} of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, heading to the east on Queen Anne's Highway, a two-lane undivided road. It heads east through <b>farmland</b> along the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway). This intersection has park and ride lots on the northwest and northeast corners. From here, MD 404 continues east through <b>farmland</b> with some residences and wooded areas as a two-lane road, approaching the town of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{starts at}} a T-intersection with US 61, {{a part of}} the Great River Road, north of Redwood. It then travels southwestward, {{adjacent}} to the Yazoo River. MS 465 then intersects Old Twin Lake Road in the village of Twin Lake, which is surrounded by a mix of forests and <b>farmland.</b> The road continues traveling southwestward, slightly elevated above the <b>farmland.</b> It then travels over a bridge, and soon turns westward, east of the Warren–Issaquena county line.|$|E
5|$|The route enters <b>farmland,</b> but bisects {{the hamlet}} of Ostrander shortly thereafter. It crosses the Ontario Southland Railway, which lies roughly {{parallel}} to {{the entire length of}} the highway, before passing west of Tillsonburg Airport and curving northwest. After travelling through <b>farmland,</b> the route enter Mount Elgin and intersects County Road18 (Mt. Elgin Road). After, it continues through more <b>farmland</b> to the community of Salford, where it encounters County Road46 (Salford Road). It turns northward briefly, emerging back into agricultural surroundings for the final stretch of the route. Just southeast of Ingersoll, it encounters an interchange with Highway401 (Exit218); Highway19 ends immediately north of the westbound ramps. County Road119 (Harris Street) continues northwest into the town to meet former Highway2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wildlife {{damage to}} {{agricultural}} crops has increas-ingly reported over the years. According to {{the guidelines of}} the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan, the effective method is suggested that the community should work cooperatively together for driving wildlife away. However, because {{it is very hard}} to predict the time and the place that the wildlife appear, it requires huge manpower and effort to guard the <b>farmlands.</b> In order to overcome the difficulty applying information technology, we have developed a system that detects the wildlife near the <b>farmlands</b> and notifies it to the people who owns the <b>farmlands.</b> Distributing the surveillance satellite boxes, in which the detection hardware is equipped, placed around <b>farmlands,</b> the system detects wildlife automatically when they are staying within 750 m away from the surveillance satellite box.
